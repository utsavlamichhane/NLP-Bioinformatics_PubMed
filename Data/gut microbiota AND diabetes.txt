Some natural products have been found to have a positive effect on the treatment 
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The effective mechanism by which these 
natural products work may be attributed to their ability to alter the gut 
microbiome. In this study, considering the beneficial properties of resveratrol 
for T2DM, the mechanism of resveratrol in releasing of T2DM, the correlation 
between the apparent traits of resveratrol in T2DM mice and the changes in 
intestinal flora structure were explored. The intervention of resveratrol in 
different dose did effectively improve the apparent T2DM symptoms in mice, 
including reduced fasting blood glucose, enhance to both the insulin tolerance 
and glucose tolerance. Simultaneously, resveratrol can effectively ameliorate 
the pathological condition of the colon and rectum in T2DM mice, leading to a 
reduction in intestinal villi swelling and fat vacuoles. The intervention of 
resveratrol led to changes in the gut flora structure of T2DM mice. Erysipelas 
and Ileibacterium are crucial taxa of resveratrol involved in maintaining the 
balance of the gut microbiota. The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae and 
Ileibacterium was significantly elevated under the treatment of resveratrol, and 
the compose of the gut microbiota was more inclined to healthy mice. T2DM 
symptoms could be alleviated by resveratrol through different mechanisms 
compared to metformin intervention.

Because large brains are energetically expensive, they are associated with 
metabolic traits that facilitate energy availability across vertebrates. 
However, the biological underpinnings driving these traits are not known. Given 
its role in regulating host metabolism in disease studies, we hypothesized that 
the gut microbiome contributes to variation in normal cross-vertebrate species 
differences in metabolism, including those associated with the brain's energetic 
requirements. By inoculating germ-free mice with the gut microbiota (GM) of 
three primate species - two with relatively larger brains and one with a smaller 
brain - we demonstrated that the GM of larger-brained primates shifts host 
metabolism towards energy use and production, while that of smaller-brained 
primates stimulates energy storage in adipose tissues. Our findings establish a 
causal role of the GM in normal cross-host species differences in metabolism 
associated with relative brain size and suggest that the GM may have been an 
important facilitator of metabolic changes during human evolution that supported 
encephalization.

Many systemic diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and cardiovascular disease, are associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The oral 
and intestinal microbiota are directly connected anatomically, and communicate 
with each other through the oral-gut microbiome axis to establish and maintain 
host microbial homeostasis. In addition to directly, periodontal bacteria may 
also be indirectly involved in the regulation of systemic health and disease 
through the disturbed gut. This paper provides evidence for the role of 
periodontal bacteria in systemic diseases via the oral-gut axis and the 
far-reaching implications of maintaining periodontal health in reducing the risk 
of many intestinal and parenteral diseases. This may provide insight into the 
underlying pathogenesis of many systemic diseases and the search for new 
preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is a major complication of diabetes 
that markedly affects the quality of life and health status of patients. Recent 
studies have investigated the potential regulatory influence of gut flora and 
bile acids on DPNP via the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway. Dysbiosis of the gut 
flora not only directly affects bile acid metabolism but also significantly 
correlates with diabetes-associated neuropathy through interactions with the 
bile acid receptor TGR5 and the ion channel TRPV1. This review describes how 
alterations in the gut flora and bile acid metabolism contribute to the 
pathogenesis of DPNP through the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway, revealing 
potential applications for this pathway in DPNP management. Furthermore, 
experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the modulation of gut flora 
and bile acid metabolism as well as targeting the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway 
as an innovative therapeutic approach. Further studies are warranted to 
elucidate the underlying mechanism and develop treatment modalities based on gut 
flora regulation and signaling pathway interventions, thus providing novel 
insights and approaches for DPNP therapy.

The role of GABA in type 1 diabetes.

Mick GJ(1), McCormick KL(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, 
AL, United States.

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic 
decarboxylase (GAD). The entero-pancreatic biology of GABA, which is produced by 
pancreatic islets, GAD-expressing microbiota, enteric immune cells, or ingested 
through diet, supports an essential physiologic role of GABA in the health and 
disease. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is uniquely concentrated 
in pancreatic β-cells. They express GAD65, which is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
autoantigen. Glutamate constitutes 10% of the amino acids in dietary protein and 
is preeminently concentrated in human milk. GABA is enriched in many foods, such 
as tomato and fermented cheese, and is an over-the-counter supplement. Selected 
microbiota in the midgut have the enzymatic capacity to produce GABA. Intestinal 
microbiota interact with gut-associated lymphoid tissue to maintain host 
defenses and immune tolerance, which are implicated in autoimmune disease. 
Although GABA is a widely known inhibitory neurotransmitter, oral GABA does not 
cross the blood brain barrier. Three diabetes-related therapeutic actions are 
ascribed to GABA, namely, increasing pancreatic β-cell content, attenuating 
excess glucagon and tamping down T-cell immune destruction. These salutary 
actions have been observed in numerous rodent diabetes models that usually 
employed high or near-continuous GABA doses. Clinical studies, to date, have 
identified positive effects of oral GABA on peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
cytokine release and plasma glucagon. Going forward, it is reassuring that oral 
GABA therapy has been well-tolerated and devoid of serious adverse effects.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a form of kidney damage resulting from diabetes 
and represents a common, severe complication of the disease. Globally, DKD is a 
leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). DKD occurs in both type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes patients, with early clinical manifestations including 
microalbuminuria and hypertension. As the condition progresses, symptoms such as 
massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and severe edema may appear. The key to 
treating DKD lies in controlling blood glucose and blood pressure, reducing 
proteinuria, and slowing the deterioration of kidney function. Acupuncture, a 
traditional Chinese medicine treatment, has shown some therapeutic effects on 
DKD through mechanisms such as regulating blood glucose, improving renal blood 
flow and microcirculation, antioxidation and anti-inflammation, and modulating 
gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Owing to the distinctive advantages of mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
exosomes (MSCs-exo), these vesicles have emerged as a pivotal research focus in 
regenerative medicine, surpassing their MSC counterparts. Quercetin (Qr), widely 
recognized for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, 
demonstrates substantial potential in enhancing tissue repair processes. This 
study delves into the role of quercetin-pretreated MSC-derived exosomes 
(MSCsQr-exo) in accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.
METHODS: MSCsQr-exo were isolated from quercetin-pretreated MSCs and applied to 
fibroblasts to evaluate changes in cell function. An in vitro DSW rat model was 
also developed, and the rats were treated with MSCsQr-exo to assess wound 
healing progression. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and 
untargeted metabolomics to analyze changes in gut microbiota and metabolic 
profiles.
RESULTS: MSCsQr-exo significantly enhanced fibroblast proliferation and 
migration while improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs-exo in DSW treatment. 
Gut microbiota and metabolomic analyses revealed marked changes in DSW rats, 
with MSCsQr-exo effectively alleviating dysbiosis. MSCsQr-exo upregulated 
Faecalibacterium abundance and regulated arachidonic acid metabolism in both the 
arachidonic and linoleic acid pathways. Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae 
influenced the arachidonic acid pathway by modulating 14.15-EET expression 
levels.
CONCLUSION: MSCsQr-exo facilitate DSW wound healing through modulation of 
dysbiotic gut microbiota linked to DSW pathology. This discovery offers novel 
therapeutic avenues and research trajectories for enhancing DSW recovery.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by T 
cell-mediated pancreatic β cell loss, resulting in lifelong absolute insulin 
deficiency and hyperglycaemia. Environmental factors are recognized as a key 
contributor to the development of T1D, with the gut serving as a primary 
interface for environmental stimuli. Recent studies have revealed that the 
alterations in the intestinal microenvironment profoundly affect host immune 
responses, contributing to the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D. However, the 
dominant intestinal immune cells and the underlying mechanisms remain 
incompletely elucidated. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible 
mechanisms of the intestinal mucosal system that underpin the pathogenesis of 
T1D, shedding light on the roles of both non-classical and classical immune 
cells in T1D. Our goal is to gain insights into how modulating these immune 
components may hold potential implications for T1D prevention and provide novel 
perspectives for immune-mediated therapy.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is 
a growing health concern and the risk of its development is connected with the 
increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which occurs as a result of 
some complex obesity-induced metabolic changes. It is a common chronic liver 
disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, the tendency 
to progress to more severe forms, and a corresponding increase in morbidity and 
mortality. Thus, effectively addressing the rising burden of the disease 
requires a thorough understanding of its complex interrelationship with obesity 
and MetS.
MAIN BODY: MASLD results from complex interactions involving obesity, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidaemia, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, and is 
influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as diet and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis. It has extensive metabolic and non-metabolic implications, 
including links to MetS components like hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and 
dyslipidaemia, and progresses to significant liver damage and other 
extra-hepatic risks like cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Diagnosis 
often relies on imaging and histology, with non-invasive methods preferred over 
liver biopsies. Emerging biomarkers and OMIC technologies offer improved 
diagnostic capabilities but face practical challenges. Advancements in 
artificial intelligence (AI), lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological 
treatments show promise, with future efforts focusing on precision medicine and 
novel diagnostic tools to improve patient outcome.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development 
of MASLD within the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is essential for 
identifying potential therapeutic targets. Advancements in non-invasive 
diagnostic tools and novel pharmacological treatments, hold promise for 
improving the management of MASLD. Future research should focus on precision 
medicine and innovative therapies to effectively address the disease and its 
consequences.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome has been reported to induce epigenetic 
modifications in the host, which may be involved in the pathophysiology of 
metabolic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome in subjects with different metabolic characteristics.
METHODS: Sixty-four participants with different metabolic characteristics (i.e., 
participants without obesity -healthy controls-, and participants with obesity 
and normal insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance/ type 2 diabetes-T2DM-) were 
included in this study. A machine learning approach was performed in order to 
identify distinctive patterns in three omics (gut microbiome, blood DNA 
methylome, and visceral adipose tissue-VAT- DNA methylome) according to the 
different study groups.
RESULTS: Robust distinctive distribution patterns of the three different omics 
were found between healthy controls and patients with obesity; participants with 
and without T2DM, and patients with obesity with and without insulin resistance. 
Importantly, strong correlations between the gut microbiome (including 
Odoribacteriaceae and Christensenllaceae families) and both blood and VAT DNA 
methylome were found. Moreover, in the entire study population, three main 
bacterial genera (Sutterella, Collinsella and Eubacterium) were related to the 
epigenetic regulation of different genes involved in distinct processes related 
to cellular metabolism and metabolic diseases, including small ubiquitin-related 
modifier (SUMO) transferase activity or lipid binding.
CONCLUSION: We show that distinctive interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome may occur in subjects with different metabolic characteristics. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of these interactions 
in the pathophysiology of obesity and related comorbidities.

Since animal growth promoters (AGPs) are used in large quantities and commonly 
released to the environment from animal farms, it is necessary to determine 
whether such agents should be regarded as an environmental toxin that poses a 
threat to the ecosystem and health risk to wildlife. In this study, a 
multi-omics approach was employed to explore the effects of a representative 
AGP, lincomycin, on key metabolic and physiological functions of animals, using 
a mouse model. The results indicated that exposure to lincomycin resulted in a 
significant increase in growth rate of mice (50.11 %) over an 8 weeks period, 
during which significant decrease (61.94 %) and increase (68.64 %) in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Escherichia coli, respectively, was 
observed in the gut microbiota, indicating that the gut microbiota structure has 
been altered. Moreover, the mice exhibited altered lipid profiles and liver 
damage suggestive of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Disruptions in blood glucose and insulin levels associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also observed. Furthermore, lincomycin was found to cause 
suppression in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of 
related genes and elevated inflammatory mediators, potentially resulting in 
increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Our findings underscore the 
detrimental effects of lincomycin on animal health and highlight the necessity 
for comprehensive toxicological assessments of lincomycin and other AGPs before 
their environmental release.

It is well known that gut microbial imbalance is a potential factor for the 
occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. 
Moreover, the heart and gut microbiota can regulate each other through the 
gut-metabolite-heart axis. In this study, metagenomics, metabolomics, and 
transcriptomics were chosen to sequence the changes in gut microbiota, serum 
metabolite levels, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leptin 
receptor-deficient db/db mice and analyze the correlation between serum 
metabolites and gut microbiota or DEGs. According to the results, there were 
significant differences in the 1,029 cardiac genes and 353 serum metabolites in 
diabetic mice of the db/db group, including DEGs enriched in the PPAR signaling 
pathway and increased short-chain carboxylic acids (CAs), when compared with the 
normal db/m group. According to metagenomics, the gut microbiota of mice in the 
db/db group were disrupted, and particularly Lachnospiraceae bacteria and 
Oscillospiraceae bacteria significantly decreased. Also, according to the 
Pearson correlation analysis, a significant positive correlation was found 
between CAs and PPAR signaling pathway-related DEGs, and a negative correlation 
was found between CAs and the abundance of the above-mentioned species. To sum 
up, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can upregulate the expression of partial 
cardiac genes through the levels of serum short-chain CAs affected by gut 
microbiota, thus playing a role in the occurrence and development of diabetic 
cardiomyopathy (DCM).
IMPORTANCE: Our research results clearly link the changes in heart genes of T2DM 
and normal mice with changes in serum metabolites and gut microbiota, indicating 
that some genes in biological processes are closely related to the reduction of 
protective microbiota in the gut microbiota. This study provides a theoretical 
basis for investigating the mechanism of DCM and may provide preliminary 
evidence for the future use of gut microbiota therapy for DCM.

OBJECTIVE: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been found to have benefits for 
diabetes mellitus (DM), but a bibliometric analysis of its association with DM 
has yet to be conducted. This paper aims to explore the current status and 
research hotspots on the connection between the Mediterranean diet and DM from 
2014 to 2024, providing a reference for future studies.
METHODS: We retrieved articles published between 2014 and 2024 from the Web of 
Science database and analyzed them using R software, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace.
RESULTS: A total of 2,806 articles were included in this study. Research on the 
relationship between the MedDiet and DM showed a steady increase in publication 
volume from 2014 to 2019, followed by a sharp rise from 2020 to 2023. Spain was 
the leading country in terms of publication volume, followed by Italy, the 
United States, China, and Greece. Spain also led in international 
collaborations, with CIBER-Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red and Harvard 
University being the most prominent collaboration centers. Nutrients was the 
most frequently published and cited journal in this field. Common keywords in 
this literature included components such as olive oil, legumes, and red wine. 
Mechanisms studied in this field primarily focused on antioxidant effects, 
improvements in insulin sensitivity and secretion, regulation of lipid 
metabolism, and modulation of gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: Research on the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on DM patients has 
garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide, and it is expected to 
become a major focus for future DM prevention and treatment. This study provides 
a comprehensive analysis of the current status and research hotspots regarding 
the relationship between the MedDiet and DM, offering valuable references for 
future research.

Obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic and health conditions are significant 
concerns in societies worldwide, necessitating the development of effective 
treatment and prevention strategies. Gut microbiota, particularly Akkermansia 
muciniphila (A. muciniphila), have emerged as key players in the onset of 
obesity and diabetes due to their impact on metabolic pathways related to food 
absorption, low-grade inflammation, and insulin signaling. Using A. muciniphila 
have been identified as a promising approach in obesity and diabetes management. 
However, the complex culture conditions and animal-based culture medium 
limitations, restrict its therapeutic perspectives as a probiotic. Pasteurized 
A. muciniphila has been found to be safe and potentially more cost-effective 
compared to live strains. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) obese-diabetic models have 
been used in previous studies due to their functional conservation in lipid 
metabolism and glucose homeostasis. These models offer a novel, easy-to-maintain 
platform for researchers studying obesity and diabetes. So, investigations are 
suggested to evaluate the effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila on gut 
microbiota composition, inflammation, and metabolic complications in an 
obese-diabetic zebrafish model. The findings can be translated into several 
potential implications and can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms 
underlying the effects of A. muciniphila on obesity and diabetes in the host's 
body.

Cholestatic liver disease (CLD) is a common liver disorder with limited 
treatment options. Here, we demonstrate that zinc (Zn) supplementation can alter 
the gut microbiome to mitigate cholestatic liver injury. Oral Zn altered the 
microbiota of mice and humans (this study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
[NCT05597137]), increasing the abundance of Blautia producta (B. producta) and 
promoting the generation of p-coumaric acid. Additionally, p-coumaric acid 
concentrations were negatively correlated with liver injury parameters in CLD 
patients. In mice, the protective effects of Zn were partially mediated by 
p-coumaric acid, which directly bound to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) and suppressed the production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in hepatocytes, thus preventing hepatocyte cell death and 
liver damage. Additionally, knocking out the histidine ammonia-lyase, which 
catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-coumaric acid in B. producta, blunted 
the protective effects of Zn. These findings highlight a host-microbiota 
interaction that is stimulated by Zn supplementation, providing potential 
benefits for CLD.

The consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has surged globally, raising 
significant public health concerns due to their associations with a range of 
adverse health outcomes. This review aims to elucidate potential health impacts 
of UPF intake and underscore the importance of considering diet quality when 
interpreting study findings. UPF group, as classified by the Nova system based 
on the extent of industrial processing, contains numerous individual food items 
with a wide spectrum of nutrient profiles, as well as differential quality as 
reflected by their potential health effects. The quality of a given food may 
well misalign with the processing levels so that a UPF food can be nutritious 
and healthful whereas a non-UPF food can be of low quality and excess intake of 
which may lead to adverse health consequences. The current review argues that it 
is critical to focus on the nutritional content and quality of foods and their 
role within the overall dietary pattern rather than only the level of 
processing. Further research should dissect health effects of diet quality and 
food processing, investigate the health impacts of ingredients that render the 
UPF categorization, understand roles of metabolomics and the gut microbiome in 
mediating and modulating the health effects of food processing, and consider 
environmental sustainability in UPF studies. Emphasizing nutrient-dense 
healthful foods and dietary patterns shall remain the pivotal strategy for 
promoting overall health and preventing chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), 
formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is becoming the most 
common chronic liver disease. The gut microbiome is regarded to play a crucial 
role in MAFLD, but the specific changes of gut microbiome, especially fungi, in 
different stages of MAFLD are not well understood. This study aimed to observe 
the longitudinal changes of colon bacteria and fungi of mice at different 
feeding duration of a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHFD), and explore the 
association between the changes and the progression of MAFLD.
METHODS: Twenty-eight male C57BL6J mice were randomly assigned to the normal 
diet (ND) group and HFHFD group. At the 8th and 16th weeks, mice were sacrificed 
to compare the diversity, composition, and co-abundance network of bacteria and 
fungi in colon contents among groups.
RESULTS: HFHFD-8W mice exhibited increases in Candida and Dorea, and decreases 
in Oscillospira and Prevotella in comparison to ND-8W mice, HFHFD-16W mice had 
increases in Bacteroides, Candida, Desulfovibrio, Dorea, Lactobacillus, and 
Rhodotorula, and decreases in Akkermansia, Aspergillus, Sterigmatomyces, and 
Vishniacozyma in comparison to ND-16W mice. And compared to HFHFD-8W mice, 
HFHFD-16W mice had increases in Desulfovibrio, Lactobacillus, Penicillium, and 
Rhodotorula, and decreases in Talaromyces and Wallemia. Spearman and GEE 
correlation analysis revealed that Bacteroides, Candida, Desulfovibrio, and 
Lactobacillus positively correlated with NAFLD activity score (NAS).
CONCLUSION: Gut microbiota and mycobiota undergo diverse changes at different 
stages of MAFLD.

Metabolic (dysfunction)-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously 
termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), represents a spectrum of liver 
pathologies linked to metabolic syndrome components. Inflammation emerges as a 
pivotal player in MASLD pathogenesis, initiating and perpetuating hepatic 
injury. Diet, a modifiable risk factor, influences inflammation levels and MASLD 
progression. This review synthesizes existing evidence on the association 
between pro-inflammatory diets, assessed via the Dietary Inflammatory Index 
(DII) and Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Potential (EDIP), and MASLD. Evidence 
suggests a significant association between higher DII/EDIP scores and MASLD 
risk, with studies revealing a positive correlation between inflammatory diet 
intake and MASLD occurrence, particularly in males. However, inconsistencies 
exist regarding the influence of body mass index (BMI) on this association and 
criticisms regarding adjustment for BMI and reliance on surrogate markers 
necessitate cautious interpretation. Limited data suggest a potential link 
between dietary inflammatory potential and advanced liver fibrosis and 
heightened risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with increased DII/EDIP 
scores, albeit requiring further confirmation through gold-standard assessment 
methods. Dietary-induced inflammation exacerbates MASLD pathogenesis through 
multiple pathways, including insulin resistance, adipose tissue dysfunction, gut 
microbiota alterations, and oxidative stress, culminating in hepatic steatosis, 
inflammation, and fibrosis. Further research utilizing robust methodologies is 
imperative to confirm these findings and elucidate underlying mechanisms, thus 
informing targeted dietary interventions for MASLD management.

Diabetic bone disease, a form of secondary osteoporosis, is characterized by 
weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures, especially in patients with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D). This review explores the key mechanisms driving this 
condition, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), and proinflammatory cytokines, all of which disturb normal bone 
turnover by disrupting the functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We examine 
the roles of bone turnover and mineralization, as well as how microvascular 
complications affect bone microarchitecture. Additionally, the influence of gut 
hormones, such as GLP-1 and GIP, and gut microbiota, particularly species like 
Akkermansia muciniphila, on the gut-bone axis is discussed, as these factors 
play a role in regulating bone density and structure. While T2D patients may 
show normal or even elevated bone mineral density (BMD), the underlying quality 
of bone is often compromised, leading to increased fragility. This review 
integrates current knowledge on the molecular, hormonal, and microbial 
interactions contributing to diabetic bone disease. By highlighting these 
pathways, we aim to offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies and 
inform future research aimed at improving the diagnosis, treatment, and overall 
management of this condition.

The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. 
Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice 
hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin 
commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal 
commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize 
the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania 
pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in 
enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune 
surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal 
environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in 
mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined 
that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial 
IL-33 and downstream IL-33-ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. 
Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to 
helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a 
context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse 
commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal 
commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse 
facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental 
outcomes and phenotypes.

The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we 
perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, 
and healthy controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene 
functions, and antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External 
metagenomic datasets from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were 
analyzed to validate our multi-biome findings. We found that Enterococcus 
faecium and Bifidobacterium spp. were enriched in both diseases. Enriched 
Escherichia coli was characteristic of CD and was linked to numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes involved in efflux pumps and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli 
virulence factors. Virome changes correlated with shifts in the bacteriome, 
including increased abundances of phages encoding pathogenic genes. 
Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in UC and CD, 
respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli had negative 
associations with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in CD. 
Multi-biome signatures and their interactions in UC and CD showed high 
similarities between Japan and other countries. Since bacteria, phages, and 
fungi formed multiple hubs of intra- or trans-kingdom networks with SCFA

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a 
significant global health issue, affecting over 30% of the population worldwide 
due to the rising prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This spectrum of liver disease ranges from isolated 
steatosis to more severe forms such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 
Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in MASLD pathogenesis, 
showing that dysbiosis significantly impacts metabolic health and the 
progression of liver disease. This review critically evaluates current 
microbiome-centered therapies in MASLD management, including prebiotics, 
probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and emerging 
therapies such as engineered bacteria and bacteriophage therapy. We explore the 
scientific rationale, clinical evidence, and potential mechanisms by which these 
interventions influence MASLD. The gut-liver axis is crucial in MASLD, with 
notable changes in microbiome composition linked to disease progression. For 
instance, specific microbial profiles and reduced alpha diversity are associated 
with MASLD severity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome could 
modulate disease progression by improving gut permeability, reducing 
endotoxin-producing bacteria, and altering bile acid metabolism. Although 
promising, these therapies require further research to fully understand their 
mechanisms and optimize their efficacy. This review integrates findings from 
clinical trials and experimental studies, providing a comprehensive overview of 
microbiome-centered therapies' potential in managing MASLD. Future research 
should focus on personalized strategies, utilizing microbiome features, blood 
metabolites, and customized dietary interventions to enhance the effectiveness 
of these therapies.

University of São Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Periodontal diseases, particularly periodontitis, are complex inflammatory 
conditions caused by interactions between oral microbiota and the host immune 
response. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria like Tannerella 
forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis are key in 
pathogenesis. This review examines how LPS impacts systemic health through 
direct invasion, compromised oral barriers, increased vascular permeability, and 
immune cell transport. LPS triggers inflammation in periodontal tissues, leading 
to tissue destruction and disease progression. In the bloodstream, LPS 
contributes to conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
respiratory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. Current treatments include 
mechanical debridement, antibiotics, antimicrobial mouthwashes, and 
anti-inflammatory therapies. Despite progress, gaps remain in understanding the 
molecular mechanisms of LPS in systemic diseases. Future research should focus 
on longitudinal studies, the gut-oral axis, biomarkers for early detection, and 
the lymphatic system's role in LPS dissemination. Maintaining periodontal health 
is crucial for overall systemic well-being.

INTRODUCTION: Both liraglutide and colesevelam improve bile acid diarrhea 
symptoms. Colesevelam binds excess amounts of diarrhea-causing bile acids in the 
colon, whereas the mode of action for liraglutide remains elusive. In this 
article, we examined the impact of colesevelam and liraglutide treatment on the 
concentrations of bile acids in serum and feces and the fecal microbiota 
composition to better understand the 2 drugs' modes of action.
METHODS: Bile acid species were analyzed in serum and fecal samples from a 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks 
of orally administered colesevelam (1,875 mg twice daily, n = 26) or 
subcutaneously administered liraglutide (uptitrated by weekly increments of 0.6 
mg from 0.6 to 1.8 mg daily, n = 26) in patients with 75 
selenium-homotaurocholic acid test-verified, idiopathic, or postcholecystectomy 
bile acid diarrhea. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing at the same time points.
RESULTS: Colesevelam increased the fecal concentrations of all bile acid 
species, whereas it decreased serum concentrations of secondary bile acids. 
Liraglutide induced a small increase in serum unconjugated bile acid 
concentrations without affecting fecal bile acid concentrations. No changes in 
fecal microbiota composition were observed with either treatment.
DISCUSSION: Colesevelam and liraglutide exhibit distinct effects on serum and 
fecal bile acid concentrations with colesevelam reducing serum concentrations of 
secondary bile acids and promoting fecal bile acid excretion, whereas 
liraglutide enhances serum concentrations of unconjugated bile acids, 
potentially through deceleration of small intestinal transit time allowing more 
time for passive absorption of bile acids.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder with a heterogeneous 
etiology encompassing societal and behavioral risk factors in addition to 
genetic and environmental susceptibility. The cardiovascular consequences of 
diabetes account for more than two-thirds of mortality among people with T2D. 
Not only does T2D shorten life expectancy, but it also lowers quality of life 
and is associated with extremely high health expenditures since diabetic 
complications raise both direct and indirect healthcare costs. An increasing 
body of research indicates a connection between T2D and gut microbial traits, as 
numerous alterations in the intestinal microorganisms have been noted in 
pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals. These include pro-inflammatory bacterial 
patterns, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and 
hyperglycemia-favoring conditions, such as the alteration of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Restoring microbial homeostasis can be very 
beneficial for preventing and co-treating T2D and improving antidiabetic therapy 
outcomes. This review summarizes the characteristics of a "diabetic" microbiota 
and the metabolites produced by microbial species that can worsen or ameliorate 
T2D risk and progression, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted strategies to 
restore eubiosis and regulate blood glucose. Nutritional supplementation, diet, 
and physical exercise are known to play important roles in T2D, and here their 
effects on the gut microbiota are discussed, suggesting non-pharmacological 
approaches that can greatly help in diabetes management and highlighting the 
importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin 
resistance and inadequate insulin production. Given the increased frequency of 
T2DM and the health issues it can cause, there is an increasing need to develop 
alternative T2DM management strategies. One such approach is Chinese Medicine 
(CM), a complementary therapy widely used in T2DM treatment. Given the emphasis 
on gut microbiota in current research, studying CM in the treatment of T2DM via 
gut microbiota modulation could be beneficial. Scope and approach: The use of 
various CM methods for managing T2DM via gut microbiota modulation is 
highlighted in this review. Following an introduction of the gut microbiota and 
its role in T2DM pathogenesis, we will review the potential interactions between 
gut microbiota and T2DM. Thereafter, we will review various CM treatment 
modalities that modulate gut microbiota and provide perspectives for future 
research. Key findings and discussion: In T2DM, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, 
and Firmicutes are examples of gut microbiota commonly imbalanced. Studies have 
shown that CM therapies can modulate gut microbiota, leading to beneficial 
effects such as reduced inflammation, improved metabolism, and improved 
immunity. Among these treatment modalities, Chinese Herbal Medicine and 
acupuncture are the most well-studied, and several in vivo studies have 
demonstrated their potential in managing T2DM by modulating gut microbiota. 
However, the underlying biomolecular mechanisms of actions are not well 
elucidated, which is a key area for future research. Future studies could also 
investigate alternate CM therapies such as moxibustion and CM exercises and 
conduct large-scale clinical trials to validate their effectiveness in 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The gut-lung axis could be a potential therapeutic target for 
improving post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, and probiotics have been proposed as 
possible modulators.
AIM: We conducted a pilot study to understand alterations in the gut-lung axis 
and to explore the effects of a probiotic in post-acute COVID-19 disease.
METHODS: We included patients after severe COVID-19 disease (sCOV, n = 21) in a 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the effect of a probiotic (Pro-Vi 
5, Institute Allergosan, Graz, Austria) in a six-month intervention and used 
patients after mild disease (mCOV, n = 10) as controls, to compare the 
intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers 
along the gut-lung axis at baseline and throughout probiotic intervention.
RESULTS: Compared to mCOV patients, sCOV patients showed lower microbial 
richness, which was significantly improved by probiotic intervention. A 
reorganization of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae taxa was observed in sCOV 
patients but remained unaffected by the intervention. Serum metabolome showed a 
dysregulation of lipoproteins in accordance with higher BMI and comorbidities in 
sCOV patients. HDL and LDL fractions/components were temporarily decreased in 
the probiotic group. Stool metabolome was altered at baseline in sCOV patients 
and an increase in L-DOPA after 3 months and butyrate after 6 months of 
intervention could be observed. Probiotics partially improved reduced quality of 
life and modulated altered immune responses in sCOV patients. Increased 
intestinal permeability at baseline remained unaffected.
CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence of long-term alterations of the gut-lung 
axis after severe COVID-19 infection and suggests that probiotics can modulate 
the biomarkers of the gut-lung axis.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nutritional deficiencies have been proposed as possible 
etiological causes for autoimmune diseases, among which type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
Vitamin K (VK) has potentially positive effects on type 2 diabetes, but its role 
on T1D in humans remains largely unknown. We aimed to examine the presence of a 
causal association between VK and T1D using a Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach.
METHODS: Genetic variants from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for VK (N 
= 2138 Europeans) were used as instruments in our two-sample MR study to 
investigate whether circulating VK levels are causally associated with the risk 
of T1D in a large European T1D GWAS cohort (18,942 cases/520,580 controls). 
Through a multivariable MR (MVMR), the effects of both VK and specific gut 
microbiota on T1D were investigated given that the gut microbiome synthesizes 
VK.
RESULTS: We found that changes in levels of circulating VK did not affect T1D 
risk in our univariate two-sample MR, but this study had limited power to detect 
small effects of VK (OR for T1D of less than 0.8). However, our MVMR indicated a 
suggestive association of VK with the risk of T1D adjusting for two different 
gut microbiome populations.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, VK levels are unlikely to significantly affect the 
risk of T1D, but small effects cannot be excluded, and the role of gut 
microbiome in this association should be further investigated.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key player in 
metabolic health, influencing glucose and lipid metabolism through various 
mechanisms. However, the efficacy of gut microbiota-targeted interventions, such 
as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and 
diet-based treatments, remains unclear for specific metabolic outcomes. In this 
study, the aim was to evaluate the impact of these interventions on the glucose 
and lipid parameters in individuals with metabolic diseases such as diabetes 
mellitus (DM), obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 41 randomized 
controlled trials that investigated the effects of gut microbiota-targeted 
treatments on metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. A comprehensive search was 
conducted using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, focusing on 
interventions targeting the gut microbiota. A meta-analysis was performed using 
random-effects models, with effect sizes calculated for each outcome. Risk of 
bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota-targeted interventions significantly reduced fasting 
glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides, with 
moderate heterogeneity observed across studies. The interventions also led to 
modest increases in HDL-C levels. Probiotic and synbiotic interventions showed 
the most consistent benefits in improving both glucose and lipid profiles, while 
FMT yielded mixed results. Short-term interventions showed rapid microbial 
shifts but less pronounced metabolic improvements, whereas longer-term 
interventions had more substantial metabolic benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it is demonstrated that gut microbiota-targeted 
interventions can improve key metabolic outcomes, offering a potential 
therapeutic strategy for managing metabolic diseases. However, the effectiveness 
of these interventions varies depending on the type, duration, and population 
characteristics, highlighting the need for further long-term studies to assess 
the sustained effects of microbiota modulation on metabolic health.

The human gut is a complex ecosystem that supports billions of living species, 
including bacteria, viruses, archaea, phages, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes. 
Bacteria give genes and enzymes for microbial and host-produced compounds, 
establishing a symbiotic link between the external environment and the host at 
both the gut and systemic levels. The gut microbiome, which is primarily made up 
of commensal bacteria, is critical for maintaining the healthy host's immune 
system, aiding digestion, synthesizing essential nutrients, and protecting 
against pathogenic bacteria, as well as influencing endocrine, neural, humoral, 
and immunological functions and metabolic pathways. Qualitative, quantitative, 
and/or topographic shifts can alter the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis 
and microbial dysfunction, which can contribute to a variety of noncommunicable 
illnesses, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. While most 
evidence to date is observational and does not establish direct causation, 
ongoing clinical trials and advanced genomic techniques are steadily enhancing 
our understanding of these intricate interactions. This review will explore key 
aspects of the relationship between gut microbiota, eubiosis, and dysbiosis in 
human health and disease, highlighting emerging strategies for microbiome 
engineering as potential therapeutic approaches for various conditions.

The ketogenic diet is becoming an assisted treatment to control weight, obesity, 
and even type 2 diabetes. However, there has been no scientific proof supporting 
that the ketogenic diet is absolutely safe and sustainable. In this study, 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed different ratios of fat to carbohydrates under 
the same apparent metabolizable energy level to evaluate the effects of a 
ketogenic diet on healthy subjects. The results showed that the ketogenic diet 
could relatively sustain body weight and enhance the levels of serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), leading to more 
moderate lipoidosis and milder local non-specific inflammation in the liver 
compared with the high-carbohydrate diet. In addition, the abundance of 
probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Faecalitalea were 
reduced with the ketogenic diet in rats, while an abundance of pathogenic 
strains such as Anaerotruncus, Enterococcus, Rothia, and Enterorhabdus were 
increased with both the ketogenic diet and the high-carbohydrate diet. This 
study suggests that the ketogenic diet can lead to impairments of liver function 
and changed composition of the gut microbiota in rats, which to some extent 
indicates the danger of consuming a generalized ketogenic diet.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disease, influenced by 
dietary and environmental factors that can modify the intestinal microbiota. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the composition and diversity of 
the intestinal microbiota associated with carbohydrate (CHO) consumption in T2DM 
patients. Forty patients participated, with and without T2DM. Fecal samples were 
collected for the characterization of microbial diversity from the massive 
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Carbohydrate consumption was quantified using 
the Frequency Consumption Foods questionnaire (FCF), the groups were categorized 
according to Body Mass Index (BMI) and BMI + CHO consumption. The group without 
T2DM showed normal biochemical and anthropometric parameters, although they had 
a high carbohydrate consumption compared to the group with T2DM. At the phylum 
level, there were differences in relative abundance; the control overweight 
group (CL-OW > CHO) and T2DM-Normal Weight > CHO patients had increased 
Bacteroides and decreased Firmicutes. In contrast, the CL-OW > CHO and T2DM-OW < 
CHO patients, showed reduced Bacteroidetes and an elevated amount of Firmicutes. 
At the genus level, the differences were in the relative abundance of Roseburia, 
Clostridium_IV, Prevotella, and Sporobacter, associated with the consumption of 
carbohydrates. The groups that consumed high amounts of carbohydrates, 
regardless of whether they had diabetes mellitus or were overweight, had a 
significantly reduced proportion of Faecalibacterium, an altered proportion of 
Bacteroides. The high consumption of carbohydrates showed considerable 
modifications in the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities.

The circadian clock gene system plays a pivotal role in coordinating the daily 
rhythms of most metabolic processes. It is synchronized with the light-dark 
cycle and the eating-fasting schedule. Notably, the interaction between meal 
timing and circadian clock genes (CGs) allows for optimizing metabolic processes 
at specific times of the day. Breakfast has a powerful resetting effect on the 
CG network. A misaligned meal pattern, such as skipping breakfast, can lead to a 
discordance between meal timing and the endogenous CGs, and is associated with 
obesity and T2D. Conversely, concentrating most calories and carbohydrates (CH) 
in the early hours of the day upregulates metabolic CG expression, thus 
promoting improved weight loss and glycemic control. Recently, it was revealed 
that microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut microbiome 
(GM), and its derived metabolites display daily oscillation, and play a critical 
role in energy and glucose metabolism. The timing of meal intake coordinates the 
oscillation of GM and GM-derived metabolites, which in turn influences CG 
expression, playing a crucial role in the metabolic response to food intake. An 
imbalance in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) can also reciprocally disrupt CG 
rhythms. Evidence suggests that misaligned meal timing may cause such 
disruptions and can lead to obesity and hyperglycemia. This manuscript focuses 
on the reciprocal interaction between meal timing, GM oscillation, and circadian 
CG rhythms. It will also review studies demonstrating how aligning meal timing 
with the circadian clock can reset and synchronize CG rhythms and GM 
oscillations. This synchronization can facilitate weight loss and improve 
glycemic control in obesity and those with T2D.

Obesity, a global public health problem, is constantly increasing, so the 
concerns in preventing and combating it are increasingly focused on the 
intestinal microbiota. It was found that the microbiota is different in lean 
people compared to obese individuals, but the exact mechanisms by which energy 
homeostasis is influenced are still incompletely known. Numerous studies show 
the involvement of certain bacterial species in promoting obesity and associated 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc. Our aim is to summarize 
the main findings regarding the influence of several factors such as lifestyle 
changes, including diet and bariatric surgery, on the diversity of the gut 
microbiota in obese individuals. The second purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the potential effect of various microbiota modulation techniques on 
ameliorating obesity and its comorbidities. A literature search was conducted 
using the PubMed database, identifying articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
Most studies identified suggest that obesity is generally associated with 
alterations of the gut microbiome such as decreased microbial diversity, an 
increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased SCFAs levels. Our 
findings also indicate that gut microbiota modulation techniques could represent 
a novel strategy in treating obesity and related metabolic diseases. Although 
some mechanisms (e.g., inflammation or hormonal regulation) are already 
considered a powerful connection between gut microbiota and obesity development, 
further research is needed to enhance the knowledge on this particular topic.

Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, the 
production of which in vivo is mainly regulated by dietary choices, gut 
microbiota, and the hepatic enzyme flavin monooxygenase (FMO), while its 
elimination occurs via the kidneys. The TMAO level is positively correlated with 
the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have found that 
TMAO plays an important role in the development of ischemic stroke. In this 
review, we describe the relationship between TMAO and ischemic stroke risk 
factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, 
thrombosis, etc.), disease risk, severity, prognostic outcomes, and recurrence 
and discuss the possible mechanisms by which they interact. Importantly, TMAO 
induces atherosclerosis and thrombosis through lipid metabolism, foam cell 
formation, endothelial dysfunction (via inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
pyroptosis), enhanced platelet hyper-reactivity, and the upregulation and 
activation of vascular endothelial tissue factors. Although the pathogenic 
mechanisms underlying TMAO's aggravation of disease severity and its effects on 
post-stroke neurological recovery and recurrence risk remain unclear, they may 
involve inflammation, astrocyte function, and pro-inflammatory monocytes. In 
addition, this paper provides a summary and evaluation of relevant preclinical 
and clinical studies on interventions regarding the gut-microbiota-dependent 
TMAO level to provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of ischemic 
stroke through the gut microbe-TMAO pathway.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. These conditions have numerous health consequences and 
significantly impact patients' lifestyles. Effective long-term treatment is 
essential since NCDs are irreversible. Therefore, primary healthcare must be 
both exclusive and of the highest quality, ensuring comprehensive care. The 
primary goal should be to improve quality of life with a focus on patients, 
families, and communities, as most of these diseases can be prevented and 
controlled, although not cured. Several factors have been linked to individual 
health, including social, cultural, and economic aspects, lifestyle, and certain 
environmental factors, including work, that can have positive or negative 
effects. More of these variables may contribute to the onset of NCDs, which are 
defined by their chronic nature, propensity for prolongation, and generally slow 
rate of progression. Examples of NCDs include hypertension, type 2 diabetes 
(T2D), dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease linked to metabolic dysfunction. 
The onset of these diseases has been associated with an imbalance in certain 
microbial niches, such as the gut, which hosts billions of microorganisms 
performing multiple metabolic functions, such as the production of metabolites 
like bile acids (BAs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and trimethylamine 
N-oxide (TMAO). Therefore, lifestyle changes and personal habits can 
significantly impact the gut microbiota (GM), potentially preventing chronic 
diseases associated with metabolism. NCDs are highly prevalent worldwide, 
prompting increased attention to strategies for modifying the intestinal 
microbiota (IM). Approaches such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and 
fecal transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated improvements in the quality of 
life for individuals with these conditions. Additionally, lifestyle changes and 
the adoption of healthy habits can significantly impact IM and may help prevent 
chronic diseases related to metabolism. Therefore, the main aim of this review 
is to analyze and understand the importance of microbiota intervention in the 
prevention of non-communicable diseases. R3:A1.

Background. In many studies over the past decade, scientists have made a 
connection between the composition of gut microbiota and human health. A number 
of publications have shown that gut bacteria are involved in many metabolic and 
physiological processes of the organism. The composition of the gut microbiome 
is unique for each person and is formed under the influence of various factors 
associated with both the individual characteristics of the body and the 
characteristics of the environment. Different regional characteristics make it 
necessary for the body to adapt to certain conditions, including temperature 
fluctuations. Living in areas with low temperatures, such as the Arctic zone, 
dictates the need for increased energy consumption, which affects the 
composition of the gut microbiome. Methods. In our study, an extensive 
questionnaire was conducted among the participants, where many questions were 
included about the dietary preferences of the study participants, which allowed 
them us to further divide them into groups according to their diets. Stool 
samples were collected from participants from 3 groups: Arctic native, Arctic 
newcomer and the control group. The next step was the isolation of bacterial DNA 
and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The analysis of the results of the diversity 
of the intestinal microbiota was carried out both with and without taking into 
account the dietary preferences of the participants. Results. As a result of 
comparing the intestinal microbiota obtained from residents of the Arctic zone 
with the gut microbiota of residents of other regions with a milder climate, 
significant differences are found. These differences may be related to limited 
food resources and a reduction in the variety of food products characteristic of 
this Arctic region. t was also found that representatives of the bacterial 
families Christensenellaceae and Muribaculaceae dominated the control group, 
both with traditional nutrition and with a dairy-free diet in comparison with 
the Arctic groups. The control group was dominated by representatives of the 
Prevotellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae families compared to the 
Arctic group (with a traditional diet). The results also show that the number of 
representatives of the families Desulfovibrionaceae (with traditional diet) and 
Enterobacteriaceae (with milk-free diet) is growing in the Arctic group. 
Conclusions. In the course of this work, bacterial families characteristic of 
people living in the Arc-tic zone of the Far Eastern region of the Russian 
Federation were identified. Poor diet, difficult climatic conditions, and 
problems with logistics and medical care can have a strong impact on the health 
of this population. The main type of diet for the inhabitants of the Arctic is 
the traditional type of diet. They consume a large number of low-cost products, 
obtainget animal protein from poultry and canned food, and also eat a small 
number of fresh vegetables and fruits. Such a diet is due to the social status 
of the study participants and the climatic and geographical features of the 
region (difficulties in agriculture). With such a diet, we observe a decrease in 
representatives of the Christensenellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Eubacteriaceae, and 
Prevotellaceae families and an increase in representatives of the 
Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae families among Arctic residents. This 
imbalance in the futuremay cause, this population may to develop various 
diseases in the future, including chronic diseases such as obesity, intestinal 
dysbiosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

Human breast milk (HBM) is considered the gold standard for infant nutrition due 
to its optimal nutrient profile and complex composition of cellular and 
non-cellular components. Breastfeeding positively influences the newborn's gut 
microbiota and health, reducing the risk of conditions like gastrointestinal 
infections and chronic diseases (e.g., allergies, asthma, diabetes, and 
obesity). Research has revealed that HBM contains beneficial microbes that aid 
gut microbiota maturation through mechanisms like antimicrobial production and 
pathogen exclusion. The HBM microbiota composition can be affected by several 
factors, including gestational age, delivery mode, medical treatments, lactation 
stage, as well as maternal lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, physical activity, 
sleep quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress level). Particularly, 
lifestyle factors can play a significant role in shaping the HBM microbiota by 
directly modulating the microbial composition or influencing the maternal gut 
microbiota and influencing the HBM microbes through the enteromammary pathway. 
This narrative review of current findings summarized how maternal lifestyle 
influences HBM microbiota. While the influence of maternal diet on HBM 
microbiota is well-documented, indicating that dietary patterns, especially 
those rich in plant-based proteins and complex carbohydrates, can positively 
influence HBM microbiota, the impact of other lifestyle factors is poorly 
investigated. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
is crucial for the health of both mother and baby. Understanding how maternal 
lifestyle factors influence microbial colonization of HBM, along with their 
interactions and impact, is key to developing new strategies that support the 
beneficial maturation of the infant's gut microbiota.

Both oat β-glucans (OGs) and their hydrolyzed counterparts, oat 
β-gluco-oligosaccharides (OGOs), are dietary fibers indigestible by humans. They 
serve as substrates for the colonic intestinal flora, exhibiting potential 
prebiotic properties. This study, through in vitro digestion simulation, found 
that OGs and OGOs are not degraded and can safely pass through the upper 
digestive tract to reach the colon. Anaerobic fermentation was conducted using 
fecal microbiota in an anaerobic tube and gastrointestinal reactor to 
investigate their impact on the structure and metabolism of intestinal flora. 
The research revealed that OGs and OGOs distinctly influence the fermentation 
characteristics and the intestinal flora's metabolic profile. Specifically, in 
static fermentation, OGs notably increased butyric acid production in both 
healthy individuals and those with type 2 diabetes, whereas OGOs more 
effectively enhanced acetic and propionic acid production in type 2 diabetics. 
Moreover, OGs and OGOs variably affected the composition of intestinal flora. In 
dynamic fermentation, there was a marked improvement in the production of 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), with OGs significantly boosting butyric acid 
and OGOs enhancing acetic acid production. This study lays a theoretical 
foundation for employing specific dietary fibers to selectively improve 
intestinal flora and supports the development of functional ingredients that 
modulate intestinal microorganisms, utilizing in vitro research methodologies.

BACKGROUND: The potential impact of specific food additives, common in Western 
diets, on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is not well understood. This 
study focuses on carrageenan, a widely used food additive known to induce 
insulin resistance and gut inflammation in animal models, and its effects on 
human health.
METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial 
conducted at a university hospital metabolic study centre, 20 males (age 27.4 ± 
4.3 years, BMI 24.5 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated. The intervention involved oral 
intake of carrageenan (250 mg) or placebo in the morning and in the evening and 
each intervention lasted 2 weeks. The primary outcome measured was insulin 
sensitivity (using oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] and 
hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp). Additional end-points included whole body 
and hepatic insulin sensitivity, MRI-measured brain inflammation and insulin 
resistance, intestinal permeability (via lactulose-mannitol test and plasma 
zonulin levels), and gut microbiome composition. Immune-cell activation and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 
measured.
RESULTS: Overall insulin sensitivity did not show significant differences 
between the treatments. However, interactions between BMI and treatment were 
observed (OGTT-based insulin sensitivity index: p=0.04, fasting insulin 
resistance: p=0.01, hepatic insulin sensitivity index: p=0.04). In overweight 
participants, carrageenan exposure resulted in lower whole body and hepatic 
insulin sensitivity, a trend towards increased brain inflammation, and elevated 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels compared to placebo. Additionally, 
carrageenan was associated with increased intestinal permeability. In vitro 
natural killer (NK-)cell activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine 
release were found after carrageenan exposure in the participant's peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that carrageenan, a common food additive, 
may contribute to insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation in overweight 
individuals through pro-inflammatory mechanisms in the gut. Further 
investigation into the long-term health impacts of carrageenan and other food 
additives is warranted.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which comprise coronary heart disease, 
hypertension, and stroke, collectively represent the number one cause of death 
globally. Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors 
are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, 
hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, 
diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal 
haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota 
project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have 
indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human 
gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, 
have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal 
disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental 
studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients 
work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current 
evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human 
inflammatory disease. In detail, we summarise the impact of fish-derived 
proteins/peptides and algae components on CVD risk factors and gut microbiome. 
Furthermore, we describe the interplay among these dietary components, 
probiotics/prebiotics, and CVDs.

The burgeoning field of microbiome research has profoundly reshaped our 
comprehension of human health, particularly highlighting the potential of 
probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as therapeutic 
interventions. While the benefits of traditional probiotics are well-recognized, 
the efficacy and mechanisms remain ambiguous, and FMT's long-term effects are 
still being investigated. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have 
identified gut microbes with significant health benefits, paving the way for 
next-generation probiotics (NGPs). These NGPs, engineered through synthetic 
biology and bioinformatics, are designed to address specific disease states with 
enhanced stability and viability. This review synthesizes current research on 
NGP stability, challenges in delivery, and their applications in preventing and 
treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular 
diseases. We explore the physiological characteristics, safety profiles, and 
mechanisms of action of various NGP strains while also addressing the challenges 
and opportunities presented by their integration into clinical practice. The 
potential of NGPs to revolutionize microbiome-based therapies and improve 
clinical outcomes is immense, underscoring the need for further research to 
optimize their efficacy and ensure their safety.

AIMS: Our study, employing a multi-omics approach, aimed to delineate the 
distinct gut microbiota and metabolic characteristics in individuals under 30 
with unclassified diabetes, thus shedding light on the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms.
METHODS: This age- and sex-matched case-control study involved 18 patients with 
unclassified diabetes, 18 patients with classic type 1 diabetes, 13 patients 
with type 2 diabetes, and 18 healthy individuals. Metagenomics facilitated the 
profiling of the gut microbiota, while untargeted liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to quantify the serum lipids and metabolites.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed a unique gut microbiota composition in 
unclassified diabetes patients, marked by a depletion of Butyrivibrio 
proteoclasticus and Clostridium and an increase in Ruminococcus torques and 
Lachnospiraceae bacterium 8_1_57FAA. Comparative analysis identified the 
combined marker panel of five bacterial species, seven serum biomarkers, and 
three clinical parameters could differentiate patients with UDM from HCs with an 
AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-1). Notably, the gut microbiota structure of patients 
with unclassified diabetes resembled that of type 2 diabetes patients, 
especially regarding disrupted lipid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite sharing certain metabolic features with type 2 diabetes, 
unclassified diabetes presents unique features. The distinct microbiota and 
metabolites in unclassified diabetes patients suggest a significant role in 
modulating glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, potentially influencing 
disease progression. Further longitudinal studies are essential to explore 
therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota and metabolites to modify 
the disease trajectory.

Metabolic-related diseases are chronic diseases caused by multiple factors, such 
as genetics and the environment. These diseases are difficult to cure and 
seriously affect human health. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), the second 
rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, plays an important role in 
cholesterol synthesis and alters the gut microbiota and tumor immunity. Research 
has shown that SQLE is expressed in many tissues and organs and is involved in 
the occurrence and development of various metabolic-related diseases, such as 
cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. SQLE 
inhibitors, such as terbinafine, NB598, natural compounds, and their 
derivatives, can effectively ameliorate fungal infections, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of recent 
research progress on the role of SQLE in metabolic-related diseases. Further 
research on the regulation of SQLE expression is highly important for developing 
drugs for the treatment of metabolic-related diseases with good pharmacological 
activity.

Food addiction contributes to the obesity pandemic, but the connection between 
how the gut microbiome is linked to food addiction remains largely unclear. Here 
we show that Microviridae bacteriophages, particularly Gokushovirus WZ-2015a, 
are associated with food addiction and obesity across multiple human cohorts. 
Further analyses reveal that food addiction and Gokushovirus are linked to 
serotonin and dopamine metabolism. Mice receiving faecal microbiota and viral 
transplantation from human donors with the highest Gokushovirus load exhibit 
increased food addiction along with changes in tryptophan, serotonin and 
dopamine metabolism in different regions of the brain, together with alterations 
in dopamine receptors. Mechanistically, targeted tryptophan analysis shows lower 
anthranilic acid (AA) concentrations associated with Gokushovirus. AA 
supplementation in mice decreases food addiction and alters pathways related to 
the cycle of neurotransmitter synthesis release. In Drosophila, AA regulates 
feeding behaviour and addiction-like ethanol preference. In summary, this study 
proposes that bacteriophages in the gut microbiome contribute to regulating food 
addiction by modulating tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism.

Background Madhumega Chooranam (MMC), a traditional Siddha polyherbal 
formulation, is used for diabetes management. Understanding its pharmacokinetics 
is crucial for evaluating its efficacy and safety in clinical practice. This 
study aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics of gallic acid, a key component of 
MMC. Methodology Ten healthy volunteers were selected based on their willingness 
to participate and the absence of significant clinical conditions, including 
liver, kidney, heart, peripheral nerve disorders, or allergies. During the 
screening phase, participants with abnormal laboratory results in blood 
chemistry, hematology, or urine analysis were excluded. All participants 
provided written informed consent before the initiation of the study. 
Participants were administered a single oral dose of 6 g of MMC. Blood samples 
were collected at predetermined intervals over 24 hours to estimate gallic acid 
content used as a pharmacokinetic marker. Results Gallic acid concentration 
peaked in some participants' plasma samples at varying intervals 
post-administration, indicating individual differences in absorption and 
metabolism. In contrast, no gallic acid peaks were detected in the plasma 
samples of three participants, suggesting potential variability in metabolic 
response or rapid clearance. Conclusions The study's findings underscore the 
complexity of MMC's pharmacokinetics, influenced by individual metabolic and 
genetic factors. Additionally, this research highlights the need for an 
interdisciplinary approach, integrating traditional medicine with modern 
pharmacogenomics and gut microbiota studies, to fully understand Siddha 
formulations' pharmacokinetics and therapeutic potential. Future studies should 
focus on larger sample sizes and consider genetic and dietary factors to enhance 
the understanding of MMC's efficacy and safety in diverse populations.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists: Role of the gut in hypoglycemia unawareness, 
and the rationale in type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes is increasing and the majority of patients have poor glycemic 
control. Although advanced technology and nanoparticle use have greatly enhanced 
insulin delivery and glucose monitoring, weight gain and hypoglycemia remain 
major challenges and a constant source of concern for patients with type 1 
diabetes. Type 1 diabetes shares some pathophysiology with type 2 diabetes, and 
an overlap has been reported. The above observation created great interest in 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) as adjuvants for type 1 
diabetes. Previous trials confirmed the positive influence of GLP-1 agonists on 
β cell function. However, hypoglycemia unawareness and dysregulated glucagon 
response have been previously reported in patients with recurrent hypoglycemia 
using GLP-1 agonists. Jin et al found that the source of glucagon dysregulation 
due to GLP-1 agonists resides in the gut. Plausible explanations could be gut 
nervous system dysregulation or gut microbiota disruption. This review evaluates 
the potential of GLP-1 agonists in managing type 1 diabetes, particularly 
focusing on their impact on glycemic control, weight management, and glucagon 
dysregulation. We provide a broader insight into the problem of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus management in the light of recent findings and provide future research 
directions.

Recent advances highlight the role of gut virome, particularly phageome, in 
metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic 
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases, 
including hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and hyperlipidemia. 
While alterations in gut bacteria are well-documented, emerging evidence 
suggests that changes in gut viruses also contribute to these disorders. 
Bacteriophages, the most abundant gut viruses, influence bacterial populations 
through their lytic and lysogenic cycles, potentially modulating the gut 
ecosystem and metabolic pathways. Phage therapy, previously overshadowed by 
antibiotics, is experiencing renewed interest due to rising antibiotic 
resistance. It offers a novel approach to precisely edit the gut microbiota, 
with promising applications in metabolic diseases. In this review, we summarize 
recent discoveries about gut virome in metabolic disease patients, review 
preclinical and clinical studies of phage therapy on metabolic diseases as well 
as the breakthroughs and currently faced problems and concerns.

Chitosan was formulated into a microsphere and comprehensively characterized and 
evaluated for its anti-inflammatory potential and anti-diabetic properties 
against the high sugar fat diet-induced diabetic animals. The diabetic model was 
induced through feeding with a high-sugar fat diet. Metformin, a standard 
antidiabetic drug, and CMS (chitosan microspheres) were administered orally for 
90 days as reversal strategies. Upon completion of the study, the following 
parameters, such as serum biochemistry, cytokine analysis, tissue histology, 
liver miRNA sequencing, and Shotgun metagenomics studies from stool samples, 
were performed. SEM images of the microsphere indicated a smooth morphology, 
while FTIR and DSC respectively, confirmed the presence of functional groups of 
chitosan and the thermal stability of the formulation. Following HSFD induction, 
all the parameters analyzed were altered compared to the control group. In both 
reversal groups, serum biochemical parameters were restored, which was at par 
with the control. A significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-10, and a remarkable reduction in TNF-α and MCP-1 inflammatory cytokines were 
observed in both reversal groups. Tissue histology indicated improvements in 
low-grade inflammation, induced in the diabetic group. miR-203 was upregulated 
in the CMS-treated group, while miR-103 was downregulated. The study further 
delved into the impact on gut microbiota and KEGG. Major phyla i.e., 
Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia 
showed restoration, while upregulation of DNA polymerase zeta in T2D showed 
reversal after the treatment. The formulation showed reversal at par with 
metformin and also confirms its anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory activities 
of CMS, with microfloral and miR regulatory functions.

Qikui granule (QKG), a hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, has 
been widely used for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in clinical practice. 
However, its holistic therapeutic effects and the underlying therapeutic 
mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the integrated analysis of 
network pharmacology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and non-targeted lipidomics was 
performed to explore the anti-DKD effects of QKG and the underlying mechanisms 
in db/db mouse DKD model. The results of the network pharmacology analysis 
identified the PI3K-AKT, EGFR, MAPK, JAK-STAT, FoxO, and AGE-RAGE signaling 
pathways as the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of 
QKG. Importantly, these signaling pathways were found to be closely related to 
lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The therapeutic effectiveness of QKG 
against DKD was manifested by reducing body weight, alleviating oxidative 
stress, improving kidney function indicators, promoting the recovery of renal 
histopathological damage, and regulating the lipid metabolic profile of serum 
and kidney in db/db mice. A total of 26 lipid metabolites were identified as 
potential pharmacological biomarkers (PPBs) of QKG for the treatment of DKD, 
which were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Meanwhile, QKG 
could alleviate DKD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis primarily by enriching 
Candidatus_Arthromitus, which showed a negative correlation with all 26 lipid 
PPBs as well as 5 biochemical parameters, including 2 oxidative stress factors 
and 3 kidney function indices. In conclusion, our findings suggest that QKG may 
upregulate the gut level of Candidatus_Arthromitus to suppress the abnormal 
activation of PI3K-AKT related signaling pathway, thereby reducing the levels of 
PC and LPC in the glycerophospholipid metabolism, to finally ameliorate the 
progression of DKD in db/db mice.

The gut microbiota is a highly complex microbial community residing in the 
digestive tract of humans and animals, closely linked to host health. Dysbiosis 
within the gut microbiota has been associated with various diseases. Moreover, 
it interacts with the female reproductive system's microbiota, influencing 
maternal reproductive homeostasis. Although the gut microbiota holds potential 
for treating reproductive system diseases and modulating offspring fertility, 
research in this domain remains limited. This review examines the relationship 
between both balanced and imbalanced gut microbiota and reproductive system 
diseases, as well as their effects on fetal development. It is highlighted that 
dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may contribute to several reproductive 
conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), preeclampsia (PE), 
endometriosis, gestational diabetes, and reproductive cancers. The abundance of 
specific gut microbial species or interactions among various species can 
influence the reproductive system through hormonal pathways and other 
mechanisms, ultimately affecting pregnancy outcomes and fetal health. Therefore, 
the concept of the gut-reproductive axis is proposed, emphasizing the 
significant role of maternal gut microbiota in shaping fetal development, 
metabolic capacity, and immunity.

Metabolic syndrome, as a complex pathological condition, is caused by a series 
of pathogenic factors and has become a global public health challenge. 
Anthocyanins, a natural water-soluble flavonoid pigment, have attracted much 
attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer biological 
activities. After ingestion, a majority of anthocyanins is not directly absorbed 
but rather reaches the colon. Hence, the exertion of their biological benefits 
is closely intertwined with the role played by gut microbiota. In this review, 
we introduce the pathogenesis and intervention methods of metabolic syndrome, as 
well as the interaction between anthocyanins and gut microbiota. We also discuss 
the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins through gut microbiota in addressing a 
range of metabolic syndrome conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 
inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, osteoporosis, and cancer.

Rice with high resistant starch (RS) exhibits the potential to improve glucose 
metabolism, insulin sensitivity. In this study, using two rice 
varieties-Samgwang, a medium-amylose rice, and Dodamssal, a high-amylose rice 
containing RS-we analyzed the composition and molecular structural 
characteristics of brown rice and its starch and the effects on fasting blood 
glucose levels, fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), and gut microbiota after 
8 weeks of consumption in mice. The amylose content of heat-treated Samgwang 
(HS) and -Dodamssal (HD) was 21.0 ± 0.2 and 47.5 ± 0.3 %, respectively, while RS 
contents were 0.8 ± 0.0 and 14.7 ± 1.0 %. HD exhibited a C-type starch 
crystallinity with a lower proportion of short chains and a higher proportion of 
long chains compared to HS. HD-fed mice exhibited lower fasting blood glucose 
levels and the highest SCFA levels in their feces. They also had the highest 
abundance of Ruminococcus bromii, an RS-degrading bacterium, the highest 
positive correlation with Faecalicatena fissicatena (r = 0.9), and the highest 
negative correlation with Lachnoclostridium scindens and Lawsonibacter 
asaccharolyticus (r = -0.8). Overall, HD consumption can improve glucose 
metabolism by increasing intestinal SCFA production and can serve as a prebiotic 
dietary ingredient to improve obesity and diabetes.

Effective, user-friendly, lifestyle-compatible, and economic treatment for type 
2 diabetes (T2D) is urgently needed due to its high incidence and health 
threats. Here, we remolded Lactococcus lactis through genetic engineering to 
persistently secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 (L. lactis-GLP-1) and subsequent 
bioorthogonal arming with dopamine (DA)-based "gripper" and β-glucan (GN)-based 
"shield" (L. lactis-GLP-1-DA@GN) for treatment of T2D mice via oral 
administration. With protection by GN-based "shield", L. lactis-GLP-1-DA@GN 
achieved an impressive enhancement of survival by 20666 times compared with bare 
L. lactis-GLP-1 after experiencing gastrointestinal conditions and DA-based 
"gripper" was shielded from interaction with the upper digestive tract. Once 
prebiotic GN was metabolized by gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs), underlying DA-based "gripper" was exposed to assist intestinal 
colonization of L. lactis-GLP-1, achieving synergistic treatment effects through 
secreted GLP-1 and SCFAs. With all advances, oral administration of L. 
lactis-GLP-1-DA@GN realized effective T2D treatment through improving 
glucose/lipid homeostasis, repairing major organs' damages, and positively 
modulating gut microbiota. Moreover, multi-omics analysis revealed that L. 
lactis-GLP-1-DA@GN also mainly intervened in liver's signaling pathways 
regarding lipid metabolism and oxidative regulation to advance anti-T2D process. 
Our strategy marks reconstruction of probiotics by combining chemical and 
biological tools, broadening the avenue of manipulating probiotics for disease 
treatments.

D-allulose, a rare sugar with emerging potential as a low-calorie sweetener, has 
garnered attention as an alternative to other commercially available alternative 
sweeteners, such as sugar alcohols, which often cause severe gastrointestinal 
discomfort. D-allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase (AlsE) is a prokaryotic enzyme 
that converts D-allulose-6-phosphate into D-fructose-6-phopshate, enabling its 
use as a carbon source. However, the taxonomic breadth of AlsE across gut 
bacteria remains poorly understood, hindering insights into the utilization of 
D-allulose by microbial communities. In this study, we provide experimental 
evidence showing that Clostridium innocuum is capable of D-allulose metabolism 
via a homologous AlsE. A bioinformatics search of 85,202 bacterial genomes 
identified 116 bacterial species with AlsE homologs, suggesting a limited 
distribution of AlsE in bacteria. Additionally, Escherichia coli contains a copy 
of alsE, but it does not grow on D-allulose as a sole carbon source unless alsE 
is heterologously expressed. A metagenomic analysis revealed that 15.8% of 3,079 
adult healthy human metagenomic samples that we analyzed contained alsE, 
suggesting a limited prevalence of the enzyme in the gut microbiome. These 
results suggest that the gut microbiome has limited capacity to metabolize 
D-allulose via alsE, supporting its use as an alternative sweetener with minimal 
impact on microbial composition and gastrointestinal symptoms. This finding also 
enables personalized nutrition, allowing diabetic individuals to assess their 
gut microbiota for alsE, and manage glycemic response while reducing 
gastrointestinal distress.

Type 2 diabetes poses significant health issues worldwide; however, relatively 
few effective treatment strategies are currently available. This research seeks 
to explore the potential hypoglycemic impact of compounds derived from common 
bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by structurally characterizing a new type of 
heteropolysaccharide (CIE2-F) and evaluating its hypoglycemic effects in a 
murine model. CIE2-F primarily comprises 10 monosaccharides, Mw: 9.25 × 105 Da. 
The polysaccharide exhibited significant anti-obesity effects, alleviated 
pathological liver damage, and reduced hyperglycemia. In addition, the 
polysaccharide mitigated insulin resistance and regulated dyslipidemia by 
increasing serum HDL-C and reducing LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides 
in diabetic mice. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that CIE2-F enriched 
beneficial gut microbiota, including Akkermansia and Verrucomicrobia, while 
decreasing pathogenic bacteria.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by immune cell infiltration in the islets 
of Langerhans, leading to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. This 
destruction is driven by secreted cytokines and cytotoxic T cells inducing 
apoptosis in beta cells. Butyrate, a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota, 
has been shown to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and 
anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we investigated the potential protective 
effects of butyrate on cytokine-induced apoptosis in beta cells and explored the 
underlying mechanisms. Insulin-secreting INS-1E cells and isolated mouse islets 
were treated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) or a combination of IL-1β and 
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in the presence or absence of butyrate. We analyzed 
apoptosis, nitric oxide (NO) levels, expression of stress-related genes, and 
immune cell migration. Our results demonstrated that butyrate significantly 
attenuated cytokine-induced apoptosis in both INS-1E cells and mouse islets, 
accompanied by a reduction in NO levels. Butyrate also decreased the expression 
of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers such as Chop, phosphorylated eIF2α 
and Atf4, as well as some pro-apoptotic genes including Dp5 and Puma. Butyrate 
reduced the cytokine-induced expression of the chemokine genes Cxcl1 and Cxcl10 
in mouse islets, as well as the chemotactic activity of THP-1 monocytes toward 
conditioned media from IL-1β-exposed islets. In conclusion, these findings 
indicate that butyrate protects beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and 
ER stress, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent to prevent beta cell 
destruction in T1D.

The gut microbiota plays a critical role in maintaining human health, 
influencing a wide range of physiological processes, including immune 
regulation, metabolism, and neurological function. Recent studies have shown 
that imbalances in gut microbiota composition can contribute to the onset and 
progression of various diseases, such as metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity and 
diabetes) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). 
These conditions are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and dysregulated 
immune responses, which are closely linked to specific forms of cell death, 
including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Pathogenic bacteria in the gut can trigger 
these cell death pathways through toxin release, while probiotics have been 
found to mitigate these effects by modulating immune responses. Despite these 
insights, the precise mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences 
these diseases remain insufficiently understood. This review consolidates recent 
findings on the impact of gut microbiota in these immune-mediated and 
inflammation-associated conditions. It also identifies gaps in current research 
and explores the potential of advanced technologies, such as organ-on-chip 
models and the microbiome-gut-organ axis, for deepening our understanding. 
Emerging tools, including single-bacterium omics and spatial metabolomics, are 
discussed for their promise in elucidating the microbiota's role in disease 
development.

Antibiotics are safe, effective drugs and continue to save millions of lives and 
prevent long-term illness worldwide. A large body of epidemiological, 
interventional and experimental evidence shows that exposure to antibiotics has 
long-term negative effects on human health. We reviewed the literature data on 
the links between antibiotic exposure, gut dysbiosis, and chronic disease 
(notably with regard to the "developmental origins of health and disease" 
("DOHaD") approach). Molecular biology studies show that the systemic 
administration of antibiotic to infants has a rapid onset but also often a 
long-lasting impact on the microbial composition of the gut. Along with other 
environmental factors (e.g., an unhealthy "Western" diet and sedentary 
behavior), antibiotics induce gut dysbiosis, which can be defined as the 
disruption of a previously stable, functionally complete microbiota. Gut 
dysbiosis many harmful long-term effects on health. Associations between 
early-life exposure to antibiotics have been reported for chronic diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, some cancers, metabolic 
diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes), allergic diseases, autoimmune disorders, 
atherosclerosis, arthritis, and neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and other 
neurological diseases. In mechanistic terms, gut dysbiosis influences chronic 
disease through direct effects on mucosal immune and inflammatory pathways, plus 
a wide array of direct or indirect effects of short-chain fatty acids, the 
enteric nervous system, peristaltic motility, the production of hormones and 
neurotransmitters, and the loss of intestinal barrier integrity (notably with 
leakage of the pro-inflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide into the 
circulation). To mitigate dysbiosis, the administration of probiotics in 
patients with chronic disease is often (but not always) associated with positive 
effects on clinical markers (e.g., disease scores) and biomarkers of 
inflammation and immune activation. Meta-analyses are complicated by differences 
in probiotic composition, dose level, and treatment duration, and large, 
randomized, controlled clinical trials are lacking in many disease areas. In 
view of the critical importance of deciding whether or not to prescribe 
antibiotics (especially to children), we suggest that the DOHaD concept can be 
logically extended to "gastrointestinal origins of health and disease" ("GOHaD") 
or even "microbiotic origins of health and disease" ("MOHaD").

BACKGROUND: Individuals with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of 
accelerated atherosclerosis, causing coronary artery disease (CAD). The 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear, but new theories proposed are damage of 
gut mucosa causing leakage and translocation of gut microbiota products into the 
circulation, leading to inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis. We therefore 
aimed to study the associations between gut related inflammatory biomarkers and 
coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with long-term type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, controlled study of 102 participants with type 
1 diabetes and 63 control subjects, we measured circulating levels of intestinal 
fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), soluble cluster of differentiation 14 
(sCD14), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and further gene expression of CD14 
and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by real time PCR in circulating leukocytes and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The participants had either 
established coronary heart disease (CHD) or underwent computed tomography 
coronary angiography (CTCA) to assess for coronary atherosclerosis, including 
total, calcified and soft/mixed plaque volumes.
RESULTS: In the diabetes group, the levels of I-FABP were significantly higher 
in participants with established CHD or significant stenosis on CTCA compared to 
the participants with normal arteries or non-significant stenosis, with median 
1.67 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 1.02-2.32) vs. median 1.09 ng/ml (IQR 
0.82-1.58), p = 0.003. I-FABP was associated with significant coronary artery 
stenosis by CTCA (> 50%) or previously established CHD in the adjusted analysis 
(odds ratio [OR] = 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-4.95; p = 0.029). 
The levels of I-FABP correlated also to total coronary plaque volume (r = 0.22, 
p < 0.05). This association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, 
persistent albuminuria, eGFR, statin treatment, diabetes duration and mean 
time-weighted variables; HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and systolic blood pressure 
(OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-3.01; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of individuals with long-term type 1 diabetes I-FABP 
associated significantly with coronary artery stenosis, suggesting a potential 
role of gut mucosa damage in the process of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes.

Due to the high incidence of diabetes and its associated complications, diabetes 
is widely recognized as a serious global health problem. In diabetes treatment 
strategies, targeting α-glucosidase, a key carbohydratehydrolyzing enzyme, has 
emerged as a highly regarded approach. To develop novel α-glucosidase 
inhibitors, we successfully synthesized a series of apigenin analogs, 
collectively referred to as H1-H27 compounds and examined their inhibitory 
effects on α-glucosidase activity. H7 showed a remarkable inhibitory effect, 
surpassing that of the standard drug acarbose. Further analysis revealed that 
H7, H10, and H24 act as non-competitive inhibitors of α- glucosidase. In vivo 
experiments using a type 2 diabetes mouse model demonstrated the diverse 
therapeutic potential of H7; it effectively lowered blood sugar levels, improved 
glucose tolerance, and corrected lipid metabolism. In addition, H7 showed 
hepatoprotective effects, highlighting its ability to improve liver function. H7 
also positively influenced the gut microbiota composition in diabetic mice, 
increasing diversity and richness. These results highlight the promising 
therapeutic effects of apigenin analogs, such as H7, for treating type 2 
diabetes and show how they could provide numerous benefits, including effective 
inhibition of α-glucosidase, improved glucose control, correction of lipid 
metabolism, hepatoprotection, and modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the oral and gut microbiota in 
prediabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients while 
exploring the association between tongue manifestations and the oral-gut 
microbiota axis in diabetes progression.
METHODS: Participants included 30 Pre-DM patients, 37 individuals with T2DM, and 
28 healthy controls. Tongue images and oral/fecal samples were analyzed using 
image processing and 16S rRNA sequencing. Machine learning techniques, including 
support vector machine (SVM), random forest, gradient boosting, adaptive 
boosting, and K-nearest neighbors, were applied to integrate tongue image data 
with microbiota profiles to construct predictive models for Pre-DM and T2DM 
classification.
RESULTS: Significant shifts in tongue characteristics were identified during the 
progression from Pre-DM to T2DM. Elevated Firmicutes levels along the oral-gut 
axis were associated with white greasy fur, indicative of underlying metabolic 
changes. An SVM-based predictive model demonstrated an accuracy of 78.9%, with 
an AUC of 86.9%. Notably, tongue image parameters (TB-a, perALL) and specific 
microbiota (Escherichia, Porphyromonas-A) emerged as prominent diagnostic 
markers for Pre-DM and T2DM.
CONCLUSION: The integration of tongue diagnosis with microbiome analysis reveals 
distinct tongue features and microbial markers. This approach significantly 
improves the diagnostic capability for Pre-DM and T2DM.

BACKGROUND: The infant gut microbiome undergoes rapid changes in the first year 
of life, supporting normal development and long-term health. While diet shapes 
this process, the role of fibers in complementary foods on gut microbiome 
maturation is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: We explored how the transition from human milk to fibers in 
complementary foods shapes the taxonomic and functional maturation of the gut 
microbiome within the first year of life.
METHODS: We assessed the longitudinal and cross-sectional development of infant 
gut microbiomes (N=68 infants) and metabolomes (N=33 infants) using linear mixed 
models to uncover their associations to dietary fibers and their food sources. 
Fiber intakes were assessed with 3-day food records (months 3,6,9,12) relying on 
CODEX-compliant fiber fraction values, and questionnaires tracked the overall 
complementary food introduction. Bacterial species were identified and 
quantified via MetaPhlAn2 from metagenomic data, and metabolomic profiles were 
obtained using four LC-MS methods.
RESULTS: We identified 176 complementary food fiber-bacterial species 
associations. First plant-based fibers associated to microbiota compositions 
similar to breastfeeding, and further associated with aromatic amino acid 
metabolites, including 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (Total dietary fiber - 
Complementary foods (g) - β=3.50, CI 2.48-4.52, p=6.53x10-5). Distinct fibers 
from different food categories showed unique associations with specific 
bacterial taxa. Key species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitznii, associated 
with oat fibers (g/MJ, β=2.18, CI 1.36-2.84, p=6.12x10-6), reflective of 
maturing microbial communities. Fiber intake during weaning associated with 
shifts in metabolite profiles, including immunomodulatory metabolites, with 
fiber effects observed in a source- and timing-dependent manner, implicated in 
gradual microbiome diversification.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing complementary dietary fibers during the weaning period 
supports gut microbiome diversification and stabilization. Even minor dietary 
variations showed significant associations with microbial taxa and functions 
from the onset of weaning, highlighting the importance of infant dietary 
recommendations that support the gut microbiome maturation during early life.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a significant global 
health challenge due to various lifestyle factors contributing to its prevalence 
and associated complications. Chronic low-grade inflammation, characterized by 
elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), plays a pivotal 
role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Modulation of the gut microbiota through 
microbiome-targeted therapy (MTT), including probiotics, prebiotics, and 
synbiotics, has emerged as a potential strategy to mitigate inflammation and 
improve metabolic outcomes in T2DM.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA 
guidelines to evaluate the impact of MTT on inflammatory markers in patients 
with T2DM. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science 
databases up to June 2024, with inclusion criteria limited to English-language 
meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of 
probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics on inflammatory markers in T2DM patients.
RESULTS: Ten meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria, comprising studies 
investigating the effects of various MTT interventions on CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α 
levels in T2DM patients. Meta-analysis results indicated significant reductions 
in CRP (SMD: -0.070; 95 % CI: -0.119 to -0.020) and TNF-α (SMD: -0.370; 95 % 
CI: -0.554 to -0.186) levels following MTT, while IL-6 reductions (SMD: -0.070; 
95 % CI: -0.269 to 0.129) did not reach statistical significance. However, 
heterogeneity in study quality, intervention protocols, and participant 
demographics posed challenges in interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: While improvements in inflammatory markers with MTT have been 
observed, significant limitations-such as heterogeneity in study quality and 
variation in intervention protocols-highlight the need for further research to 
confirm its efficacy and clarify underlying mechanisms. Future studies should 
aim to address these limitations by exploring variations in dosage, supplement 
formulations, and bacterial strains, which are crucial for improving the 
reliability and broader applicability of MTT in the management of T2DM.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the joint effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
and objective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) on glucose metabolism and the 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: We included 127 patients with OSA. The multiple sleep latency test 
(MSLT) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) were used to assess objective and 
subjective EDS, respectively. Disordered glucose metabolism was defined as 
either a physician diagnosis or having fasting blood glucose levels ≥ 5.6 
mmol/L. Values of fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR) higher than the median values of our sample were defined as 
high fasting insulin and insulin resistance. Serum metabolomics and fecal 
microbiota were used to explore underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: Lower MSLT values were associated with higher levels of fasting blood 
glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR. Furthermore, objective EDS was associated 
with increased odds of disordered glucose metabolism, elevated fasting insulin, 
and insulin resistance. Dysregulation of serum valine degradation and dysbiosis 
of fecal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were associated with impaired glucose 
metabolism in OSA with objective EDS. No association between subjective EDS and 
impaired glucose metabolism was observed.
CONCLUSION: OSA with objective, but not subjective, EDS is associated with an 
increased risk of disordered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. 
Dysregulation of valine degradation and dysbiosis of Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron appear to link objective EDS and disordered glucose metabolism 
in OSA.

Modern lifestyle changes, especially the consumption of a diet high in salt, 
sugar, and fat, have contributed to the increasing incidence and prevalence of 
chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and gout. Changing 
lifestyles continuously shape the gut microbiota which is closely related to the 
occurrence and development of metabolic diseases due to its specificity of 
composition and structural diversity. A large number of pathogenic bacteria such 
as Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, and pathogenic E. coli in the gut utilize the 
type III secretion system (T3SS) to help them resist host defenses and cause 
disease. Although the T3SS is critical for the virulence of many important human 
pathogens, its relationship with metabolic diseases remains unknown. This 
article reviews the structure and function of the T3SS, the disruption of 
intestinal barrier integrity by the T3SS, the changes in intestinal flora 
containing the T3SS in metabolic diseases, the possible mechanisms of the T3SS 
affecting metabolic diseases, and the application of the T3SS in the treatment 
of metabolic diseases. The aim is to provide insights into metabolic diseases 
targeting the T3SS, thereby serving as a valuable reference for future research 
on disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

IMPORTANCE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is linked with alterations 
in the gut microbiome. The influence of adenotonsillectomy (AT), a primary 
intervention for OSA, on gut microbiota dynamics relative to disease severity 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of OSA severity and AT on 
the gut microbiome in pediatric patients.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 55 pediatric patients treated with AT for OSA.
INTERVENTION: Total tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive evaluations included in-laboratory 
polysomnography and 16S rRNA gut microbiome profiling at baseline, and again at 
3rd and 12thmonth following surgery.
RESULTS: Initial findings showed uniform α-diversity across different severities 
of OSA, while β-diversity was significantly elevated in the severe OSA subgroup. 
Certain gut microbiota taxa (Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Ruminococcaceae 
UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Alloprevotella, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, 
Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Lactobacillus murinus, and Prevotella nigrescens) were 
found to inversely correlate with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Significant 
post-AT improvements in AHI and other polysomnographic metrics were observed. 
Notably, AHI changes post-AT were positively associated with microbial 
α-diversity (species richness), β-diversity, and specific bacterial taxa 
(Enterobacter, Parasutterella, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Bacteroides plebeius 
DSM 17135), but negatively with other taxa (Fusicatenibacter, Bifidobacterium, 
UBA1819, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. Longum, and 
Parabacteroides distasonis) and specific metabolic pathways (purine metabolism, 
transcription factors, and type II diabetes mellitus). The postoperative 
patterns of α- and β-diversity mirrored baseline values.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study documents significant changes in the gut 
microbiome of pediatric patients after AT, including variations in α- and 
β-diversities, bacterial communities, and inferred metabolic functions. These 
changes suggest a potential association between the surgical intervention and 
microbiome alterations, although further studies are necessary to discern the 
specific contributions of AT amidst possible confounding factors such as 
antibiotic use.

Impulsivity is an important determinant of human behaviour, affecting 
self-control, reasonable thinking and food choices. Recent evidence suggests a 
role for gut microbiota in human behaviour, but the relationship between gut 
microbiota and impulsive behaviours remains largely unexplored. To address this 
knowledge gap, the present study aims to explore the associations between faecal 
microbiota composition with trait and behavioural impulsivity, in a subcohort of 
the PREDIMED-Plus trial, including older adults presenting overweight/obesity. 
Fecal samples (n = 231) were profiled for their microbiota composition using 
16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and impulsivity was determined through four 
different assessments. Adherence to different dietary patterns was estimated 
through questionnaires. Beta diversity analyses showed a significant association 
with the Conner's Performance Test (CPT) in multivariate-adjusted models, and, 
in total, 13 bacterial genera associated with CPT. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG 003 
showed the highest association with CPT and known butyrate producers such as 
Butyricicoccus spp., Roseburia spp., and Eubacterium hallii were among the 
identified bacteria. The bacteria Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Anaerostipes and 
Blautia were associated with CPT and also the adherence to healthy and unhealthy 
plant-based diets. In addition, functional analysis showed a significant 
negative association between the CPT and the glucuronate and galacturonate 
metabolic pathways. From the other impulsivity assessments, two more 
associations were identified, for the genus Phascolarctobacterium with the 
Stroop test, and the genus Lachnospiraceae GAG 54 with the positive urgency 
subscore of UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale. Overall, our findings suggest 
potential links between the faecal microbiota composition and function with 
behavioural impulsive inattention as determined by the CPT.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the role of the endocannabinoid system 
(ECS) in regulating energy balance, food intake, and metabolism, with a focus on 
how ECS dysregulation contributes to obesity. The goal is to provide insights 
into the mechanisms underlying obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research indicates that the ECS significantly influences 
food intake, fat storage, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, all of which 
are central to the development and progression of obesity. New research areas 
include the interaction between the ECS and gut microbiota, circadian rhythms of 
the ECS, and the impact of genetic and epigenetic factors on ECS function. 
Interest in the therapeutic potential of targeting the ECS has grown, with 
earlier treatments like CB1 receptor antagonists showing mixed results in 
efficacy and safety. Evidence from both animal and human studies highlight the 
impact of elevated levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG on food 
intake, insulin resistance, visceral fat accumulation, and metabolic 
disturbances associated with obesity. The review explores the interaction 
between the ECS and other physiological systems, including gut-brain 
communication, circadian rhythms, as well as leptin and ghrelin signaling. 
Additionally, genetic and epigenetic factors influencing ECS function are 
examined, emphasizing their contribution to obesity susceptibility. While 
therapeutic approaches targeting the ECS, particularly CB1 receptor antagonism, 
have shown potential in managing obesity, the review acknowledges the challenges 
posed by central nervous system side effects in earlier treatments like 
rimonabant. However, recent advancements in peripherally restricted CB1 
antagonists offer renewed hope for safer and more effective obesity treatments. 
The review concludes by addressing future research directions and therapeutic 
strategies to combat this global health challenge.

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective in 
reversing gut dysbiosis, we lack an understanding of the fundamental processes 
underlying microbial engraftment in the mammalian gut. Here, we explored a 
murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in 
gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a 
natural "super-donor" consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients 
and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome 
showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 
h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, 
engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract 
in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested 
engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing 
species from the super-donor consortia. These results offer a mechanism of 
super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a 
spatiotemporally dependent manner. A record of this paper's transparent peer 
review process is included in the supplemental information.

The microbiota in individual habitats differ in both relative composition and 
absolute abundance. While sequencing approaches determine the relative 
abundances of taxa and genes, they do not provide information on their absolute 
abundances. Here, we developed a machine-learning approach to predict fecal 
microbial loads (microbial cells per gram) solely from relative abundance data. 
Applying our prediction model to a large-scale metagenomic dataset (n = 34,539), 
we demonstrated that microbial load is the major determinant of gut microbiome 
variation and is associated with numerous host factors, including age, diet, and 
medication. We further found that for several diseases, changes in microbial 
load, rather than the disease condition itself, more strongly explained 
alterations in patients' gut microbiome. Adjusting for this effect substantially 
reduced the statistical significance of the majority of disease-associated 
species. Our analysis reveals that the fecal microbial load is a major 
confounder in microbiome studies, highlighting its importance for understanding 
microbiome variation in health and disease.

AIM: This review aims to identify the mechanistic relationships related to 
periodontal diseases and its possible association with changes in human milk 
composition and the composition and function of infants' gut microbiome.
BACKGROUND: Maternal health conditions, especially inflammatory, are associated 
with altered human milk composition. It is not known whether maternal oral 
inflammatory diseases, including periodontal diseases, deleteriously affect 
human milk composition.
METHODS: A narrative review was conducted according to SANRA, the Scale for the 
Assessment of Narrative Review Articles, guidelines. PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched from September 2019 up to 
December 2023 using keywords such as breast/human milk, maternal 
health/infections, and periodontal diseases. Reference lists of relevant 
articles were also screened. Our primary outcome of interest was human milk 
composition (i.e., any changes in macronutrients, immunological components, 
etc.). Secondary outcomes included changes in human milk microbiome and 
subsequent changes in the infant gut microbiome. Outcomes were synthesized using 
a narrative approach where the existing evidence and current literature were 
summarized. No risk of bias assessment of the studies was performed in this 
review.
FINDINGS: The search yielded no studies investigating the relationship between 
periodontal diseases in nursing mothers and changes in human milk composition. 
However, a dose-response relationship exists between the severity of periodontal 
diseases and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. 
Mastitis and diabetes affected milk lipids. Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) was 
increased in mastitis, whereas reduced concentrations were reported in diabetes. 
Potential biological pathways through which periodontal diseases can negatively 
affect human milk composition include the systemic dissemination of inflammatory 
cytokines like IL-6, PGE2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-β that can be 
up-regulated by bacterial by-products. This biological plausibility needs to be 
investigated, given the potentially negative impact on the quality of human milk 
that could be caused by periodontal inflammation.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are chronic conditions that affect the aging population, with 
increasing prevalence globally. The rising prevalence of comorbidity between 
these conditions, driven by demographic shifts, severely impacts the quality of 
life of patients, posing a significant burden on healthcare resources. Chinese 
herbal medicine has been used to treat T2DM and PD for millennia. 
Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that medicinal herbs effectively lower 
blood glucose levels and exert neuroprotective effects, suggesting their 
potential as adjunctive therapy for concurrent management of T2DM and PD.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the shared mechanisms underlying T2DM and PD, 
particularly focusing on the potential mechanisms by which medicinal herbs 
(including herbal formulas, single herbs, and active compounds) may treat these 
diseases, to provide valuable insights for developing therapeutics targeting 
comorbid T2DM and PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies exploring the mechanisms underlying T2DM and PD, 
as well as the treatment of these conditions with medicinal herbs, were 
extracted from several electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, 
Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).
RESULTS: Numerous studies have shown that inflammation, oxidative stress, 
insulin resistance, impaired autophagy, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and 
ferroptosis are shared mechanisms underlying T2DM and PD mediated through the 
NLRP3 inflammasome, NF-κB, MAPK, Keap1/Nrf2/ARE, PI3K/AKT, AMPK/SIRT1, and 
System XC--GSH-GPX4 signaling pathways. Thirty-four medicinal herbs, including 2 
herbal formulas, 4 single herbs, and 28 active compounds, have been reported to 
potentially exert anti-T2DM and anti-PD effects by targeting these shared 
mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional Chinese medicine effectively combats T2DM and PD 
through shared pathological mechanisms, highlighting their potential for 
application in treating these comorbid conditions.

The Anti-Elixir Triad: Non-Synced Circadian Rhythm, Gut Dysbiosis and Telomeric 
Damage.

Mani AK, Parvathi VD, Ravindran S.

Aging is an inevitable life process which is accelerated by lifestyle and 
environmental factors. It is an irreversible accretion of molecular and cellular 
damage associated with changes in the body composition and deterioration in 
physiological functions. Each cell (other than stem cells), reaches the limit of 
its ability to replicate, known as cellular or replicative senescence and 
consequently, the organs lose their physiological functions resulting in overall 
impairment. Other factors that promote aging include smoking, alcohol, UV rays, 
sleep habits, food, stress, sedentary life style and genetic abnormalities. 
These stress factors, can alter our endogenous clock (the circadian rhythm) and 
the microbial commensals. As a result of effect of these stressors, the 
microorganisms that generally support human physiological processes become 
baleful. The disturbance of natural physiology instigates many age-related 
pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disorder, cerebrovascular diseases, opportunistic infections, high blood 
pressure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. 
The present review covers the three most essential processes of the circadian 
clock; the circadian gene mechanism and regulation, the mitotic clock (which 
plays a vital role in the telomere's attrition) and gut microbiota and their 
metabolome that drive aging and lead to age-related pathologies. In conclusion, 
maintaining a synchronized circadian rhythm, a healthy gut microbiome and 
telomere integrity is essential for mitigating the effects of aging and 
promoting longevity. The interplay among these factors underscores the 
importance of lifestyle choices in enhancing overall health and lifespan.

BACKGROUND: Clinical observations have recently shown that Abelmoschus manihot 
(L.) in the form of Huangkui capsule (HKC) and in combination with irbesartan 
(EB) is an effective therapy for diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 
2 diabetes (T2D). The present study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying 
the therapeutic efficacies of HKC and its combination with EB in DN via the 
gut-kidney axis.
METHODS: HKC, EB, and their combination or vehicle were administered in db/db 
mice, which is an animal model for the study of T2D and DN. Comparative analyses 
of the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and kidney transcriptomics before and 
after drug administration were performed.
RESULTS: After treatment with HKC, EB, and their combination for 4 weeks, the 
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios decreased significantly in the db/db mice 
with DN. In terms of the gut microbiota, the abundances of Faecalitalea, 
Blautia, and Streptococcus increased but those of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and Desulfovibrio decreased. Parallelly, serum metabolites, 
mainly including quercetin 3'-glucuronide and L-dopa, were elevated while 
cortisol and cytochalasin B were reduced. Furthermore, the S100a8, S100a9, 
Trem1, and Mmp7 genes in the kidneys were downregulated. These altered elements 
were associated with proteinuria/albuminuria reduction. However, EB had no 
effects on the changes in blood pressure and specific differentially expressed 
genes in the kidneys.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides experimental evidence that HKC regulates 
the gut microbiota, circulating metabolites, and renal gene activities, which 
are useful for better understanding of the action mechanisms of A. manihot in 
the treatment of DN through the gut-kidney axis.

BACKGROUND: Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a common chronic autoimmune 
disease that presents limited treatment options and poses significant challenges 
for patients. Maidong Dishao Decoction (MDDST), a traditional Chinese medicine 
compound, has demonstrated potential in alleviating dryness symptoms associated 
with pSS. Therefore, it is important to study the specific mechanism of its 
therapeutic effect.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of MDDST on gut 
microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the Th17/Treg immune balance in 
non-obese diabetes (NOD) mice.
METHODS: The study employed ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled 
with quadrupole-exactive mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS) to identify the primary 
components of MDDST. Subsequently, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and flow cytometry analyses were 
conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of MDDST in NOD mice. 
Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) were utilized to assess the influence of MDDST on gut microbiota and 
SCFAs. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and SCFA-based 
interventions were performed to elucidate the mechanisms through which MDDST 
exerts its effects.
RESULTS: The research findings demonstrate that MDDST exerts therapeutic effects 
on NOD mice, primarily manifested as reduced inflammation, decreased water 
intake, ameliorated pathological changes and lowered levels of Sjogren's 
syndrome antigen A (SSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Additionally, MDDST 
significantly decreased serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 
(IL-17), while enhancing levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming 
growth factor beta (TGF-β), thereby regulating the Th17/Treg immune balance. 
Further investigations revealed that MDDST treatment induces alterations in gut 
microbiota composition and elevates SCFA levels in the gut. Subsequent FMT and 
SCFA intervention experiments demonstrated a downregulation of pSS-related 
phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: In summary, MDDST demonstrates protective effects against pSS by 
restoring the balance between Th17 and Treg cells. The therapeutic effects can 
be partially attributed to its regulation of gut microbiota and SCFAs. Our 
finding provides a new option for treating pSS.

Metabolic diseases, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, have 
become severe challenges worldwide. The Developmental Origins of Health and 
Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis suggests that an adverse intrauterine environment can 
increase the risk of metabolic disorders in offspring. Studies have demonstrated 
that maternal exercise is an effective intervention for improving the offspring 
metabolic health. However, the pathways through which exercise works are 
unclear. It has been reported that the gut microbiota mediates the effect of 
maternal exercise on offspring metabolism, and epigenetic modifications have 
also been proposed to be important molecular mechanisms. Microbial metabolites 
can influence epigenetics by providing substrates for DNA or histone 
modifications, binding to G-protein-coupled receptors to affect downstream 
pathways, or regulating the activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes. This 
review aims to summarize the intergenerational effect of maternal exercise and 
proposes that gut microbiota-metabolites-epigenetic regulation is an important 
mechanism by which maternal exercise improves offspring metabolism, which may 
yield novel targets for the early prevention and intervention of metabolic 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: The aqueous extraction of sesame oil is a traditional process that 
generates a large amount of melanoidins. However, little is known about the 
characteristics and bioactive functions of these melanoidins.
RESULTS: Electronic tongue, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy analyses indicated that melanoidins from sesame 
residues (MELs) are brown macromolecular compounds with protein skeletons and 
heteroaromatic ring structures, a bitter taste, and instability in strong 
oxidative and reductive environments. The MELs demonstrated inhibitory effects 
on α-glucosidase, α-amylase and pancreatic lipase in vitro. These MELs mitigated 
weight loss in mice with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), reduced their fasting blood 
glucose to 54.73% (500 mg kg-1 day-1) of the initial value, increased the 
glycogen levels in the liver and skeletal muscles, lowered blood lipid levels, 
and protected the liver. Western blot analysis revealed that MELs inhibited the 
activities of enzymes such as PEPCK, FBPase, and G6Pase through the 
IRS-1/PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways, increased the activity of the enzymes 
hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), enhanced liver glycolytic ability, and 
promoted liver glycogen synthesis, thereby reducing blood glucose levels in T2DM 
mice. Moreover, MELs reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides (F/B) in the 
intestines of T2DM mice, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria 
such as Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcus, and reduced the propionic 
acid content.
CONCLUSIONS: Melanoidins can regulate T2DM by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt and 
AMPK-signaling pathways and ameliorating gut microbiota imbalances in T2DM mice.

CONTEXT: There is a significant challenge associated with the co-morbidity of 
mental and physical illnesses throughout the world. A classic example of 
mental/physical co-morbidity is diabetes-related depression (DD).
OBJECTIVE: DD is treated with Zuogui Jiangtang Jieyu prescription (ZJJ). 
Diabetes and psychiatric disorders are associated with dysbiosis of the gut 
microbiota. In this study, the aim is to examine the effects of ZJJ on gut 
microbiota and neuroinflammation in DD.
METHODS: A model of DD was established and treated with medium and high doses of 
ZJJ as well as Metformin & Fluoxetine. A detection of depressive-like behavior 
was then conducted on the rats. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured in 
cerebrospinal fluid, and HPA axis-related proteins, glucose metabolism, and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were measured in serum. Fecal samples from each group 
were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing; TLR4 and MyD88 levels were 
detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the hippocampus.
RESULTS: High doses of ZJJ (ZJJ-H) were found to alleviate HPA axis 
hyperactivity and improve gut microbiota in rats with DD. Additionally, ZJJ 
treatment attenuated the inflammatory response in cerebrospinal fluid, e.g. a 
significant reduction in proinflammatory factors, a decrease in serum LPS 
levels, and an inhibition of TLR4/MyD88-related pathways in the hippocampus.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: ZJJ improved DD glucose metabolism and alleviated 
depression-like behaviors by improving gut microbiota and inhibiting hippocampal 
TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathways.

Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of gut microbiome in bone health. 
Aging is well recognized as a crucial factor influencing the gut microbiome. In 
this study, we investigated whether age-dependent microbial change contributes 
to age-related bone loss in CB6F1 mice. The bone phenotype of 24-month-old 
germ-free (GF) mice was indistinguishable compared to their littermates 
colonized by fecal transplant at 1-month-old. Moreover, bone loss from 3 to 
24-month-old was comparable between GF and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. 
Thus, GF mice were not protected from age-related bone loss. 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing of fecal samples from 3-month and 24-month-old SPF males indicated an 
age-dependent microbial shift with an alteration in energy and nutrient 
metabolism potential. An integrative analysis of 16S predicted metagenome 
function and LC-MS fecal metabolome revealed an enrichment of protein and amino 
acid biosynthesis pathways in aged mice. Microbial S-adenosyl methionine 
metabolism was increased in the aged mice, which has previously been associated 
with the host aging process. Collectively, aging caused microbial taxonomic and 
functional alteration in mice. To demonstrate the functional importance of young 
and old microbiome to bone, we colonized GF mice with fecal microbiome from 
3-month or 24-month-old SPF donor mice for 1 and 8 months. The effect of 
microbial colonization on bone phenotypes was independent of the microbiome 
donors' age. In conclusion, our study indicates age-related bone loss occurs 
independent of gut microbiome.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is often characterized by the appearance of several 
tiny cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in the ovaries. It is the most significant 
endocrinopathy affecting 8-13 % of women during their lifetime. Within the 
dynamic domain of women's health, this syndrome is a widespread issue that 
presents with an array of signs, including insulin resistance, hirsutism, 
androgen development, and menstrual flaws prompted by genetic, diet/lifestyle, 
gut microbiota dysbiosis, and environmental toxins. Impaired folliculogenesis, 
aberrant cortisol metabolism, and genes associated with steroidogenesis 
contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Moreover, it combines with 
various concurrent metabolic and idiopathic conditions specifically type 2 
diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and infertility. On persuading the reproductive 
framework of women from ontogeny to menopause, the complexity of the syndrome 
hereditates generations due to maternal inheritance of hyperandrogenism. The 
advancement in diagnostic norms paved the way from the Rotterdam criteria to 
metabolomics, 3D ultrasound, and assisted reproductive technologies. The 
management and treatment of this hormonal disorder can be prevailed through 
lifestyle modifications and prompt medications. This review entails the 
aforementioned benchmarks of the syndrome's complexity and its ongoing research 
in alleviating its intricate behavioral changes in women from in-utero to 
menopause.

The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) imposes a substantial 
burden on public health and healthcare expenditures, thereby driving the pursuit 
of cost-effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence 
suggests a potential association between dysbiosis of gut microbiota and its 
metabolites with T2DM, indicating that targeted interventions aimed at 
modulating gut microbiota may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the 
management of T2DM. In this review, we concentrated on the multifaceted 
interactions between the gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier in the 
context of T2DM. We systematically summarized that the imbalance of beneficial 
gut microbiota and its metabolites may constitute a viable therapeutic approach 
for the management of T2DM. Meanwhile, the mechanisms by which gut microbiota 
interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, 
synergistically improve insulin resistance in T2DM are summarized. These 
mechanisms include the restoration of gut microbiota structure, upregulation of 
intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of 
tight junction protein expression, promotion of mucin secretion by goblet cells, 
and the immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) and M2 
macrophages. Collectively, these actions contribute to the amelioration of the 
body's metabolic inflammatory status. Our objective is to furnish evidence that 
supports the clinical application of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in 
the management of T2DM.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency and 
hyperglycemia, and its incidence is increasing year by year. The pathogenesis of 
T1DM is complex, mainly including genetic and environmental factors. Intestinal 
flora is the largest microbial community in the human body and plays a very 
important role in human health and disease. In recent years, more and more 
studies have shown that intestinal flora and its metabolites, as an 
environmental factor, regulate the development of T1DM through various 
mechanisms such as altering the intestinal mucosal barrier, influencing insulin 
secretion and body immune regulation. Intestinal flora transplantation, 
probiotic supplementation, and other approaches to modulate the intestinal flora 
appear to be potential therapeutic approaches for T1DM. This article reviews the 
dysbiosis of the intestinal flora in T1DM, the potential mechanisms by which the 
intestinal flora affects T1DM, as well as discusses potential approaches to 
treating T1DM by intervening in the intestinal flora.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fish 
oil-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) on gut 
microbiota and serum lipid metabolites in T2DM.
METHODS: In a three-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
110 T2DM patients received either fish oil (n = 55) or corn oil (n = 55) 
capsules daily. Serum lipids, glycemic parameters, gut microbiota diversity, and 
lipidomics were assessed.
RESULTS: This study found that fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs intervention did 
not significantly lower the fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with the 
baseline level (p > 0.05). However, serum fasting blood glucose (p = 0.039), 
glycosylated hemoglobin levels (p = 0.048), HOMA-IR (p = 0.022), total 
cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglyceride (p = 0.034), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.048), 
and non-HDL levels (p = 0.046) were significantly lower in the fish oil group 
compared with the corn oil group after three months of intervention. Also, it 
altered glycerophospholipid metabolism and gut microbiota. After three months, 
the fish oil group showed a significantly lower abundance of Desulfobacterota 
compared with the corn oil control group (p = 0.003), with reduced levels of 
Colidextribacter (p = 0.002), Ralstonia (p = 0.021), and Klebsiella (p = 0.013). 
Conversely, the abundance of Limosilactobacillus (p = 0.017), Lactobacillus (p = 
0.011), and Haemophilus (p = 0.018) increased significantly. In addition, 
relevant glycolipid metabolism indicators showed significant correlations with 
the altered profiles of serum lipid metabolites, intestinal bacteria, and fungi.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of fish oil-derived omega-3 PUFAs 
on intestinal microbiota structure and function in patients with type 2 
diabetes. The observed decrease in pathogenic bacterial species and the 
enhancement of beneficial species may have significant implications for gut 
health and systemic inflammation, both of which are pivotal in managing 
diabetes. Further research is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the 
long-term benefits and underlying mechanisms of these microbiota alterations.

Supplementation of Miso to a Western-Type Diet Stimulates ILC3s and Decreases 
Inflammation in the Small Intestine.

Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Western-type diets (WDs) damage the intestinal barrier by 
disrupting the gut microbiota composition and causing inflammation, leading to 
the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by the gut microbiota and 
found in fermented foods and can stimulate the anti-inflammatory action of type 
3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCS3s) in the intestine. This study hypothesised that 
supplementing miso, a Japanese fermented food, to a WD could increase the levels 
of SCFAs and thus stimulate ILC3s, decreasing inflammation in the intestine and 
protecting intestinal barrier integrity.
METHODS: Mice with RORγt total (KI/KI) or partial (KI/w) knockout were fed a 
high-fat high-sugar diet (HFHSD) for eight weeks as a model of WD. Half of the 
mice received miso supplementation in addition to the HFHSD. Weight gain, 
glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, intestinal barrier integrity, 
intestinal immunity, and liver condition were assessed.
RESULTS: Miso supplementation increased SCFA levels in the small intestine, 
which stimulated ILC3 function in KI/w mice. Glucose tolerance was improved, 
intestinal barrier integrity was ameliorated, and mucus production was 
increased. The level of IL-22 was increased, while pro-inflammatory ILC1s, M1 
macrophages, TNF-α, and IL-1β were decreased. Liver condition was not affected.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that miso supplementation influenced 
several factors involved in inflammation and intestinal barrier integrity by 
stimulating ILC3s in RORγt heterozygous mice. Moreover, it showed that the 
number of ILC3s is not the key factor in immune regulation, but rather the 
ability of ILC3 to produce IL-22 and employ it to control the immune response in 
the small intestine.

Nutrition is an essential part of therapy for type 1 diabetes and is constantly 
evolving, offering growing opportunities to prevent this disease, slow down its 
evolution, and mitigate it. An attempt was made to bring together the current 
state of knowledge. In the path from the preclinical phase of the disease to its 
clinical onset, there is a phase known as the "honeymoon period" or partial 
remission, where different possible dietary options for combatting this disease 
have been presented. The most commonly used dietary models were compared, and 
the most frequent co-existing pathologies, such as overweight, non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, celiac disease, and metabolic instability, 
were addressed from their nutritional and dietary perspectives to provide 
clinicians with an updated framework of knowledge and support researchers in 
further investigations into the topic. Finally, a glimpse into the possible 
interplay between nutrition and the gut microbiome, food security, and 
ultra-processed food is provided. It is hoped that clinicians treating people 
with type 1 diabetes will be provided with further opportunities for the daily 
management of their patients through personalized nutrition.

Background/Objective: High habitual consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners 
(NNS) is linked to increased incident type 2 diabetes, with emerging clinical 
evidence that effects on gut microbiota may, in part, drive this risk. However, 
the precise contribution of the effects of NNS on gut microbiota to host 
glycemic responses remains unclear. Methods: Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (N = 
10 per group) were randomized to drinking water with or without combined NNS 
(sucralose 1.5 mg/mL plus acesulfame-K 2.5 mg/mL) and with or without 
antibiotics to deplete gut microbiota (ABX, 1 mg/mL ampicillin and neomycin) 
over two weeks. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT, 2 g/kg) were conducted on 
days -1 and 12. On day 14, mice underwent a jejunal infusion of glucose (300 mg) 
with 3-O-methyl glucose (30 mg, 3-OMG, a marker of glucose absorption) in 1.5 mL 
for 30 min, followed by blood collection and bioassays. Data were analyzed using 
ANOVA with NNS and ABX as factors. Results: Jejunal glucose absorption was 
augmented in NNS+ mice relative to NNS- (31%; 3-OMG T30; p ≤ 0.05) independent 
of ABX. ABX attenuated OGTT responses independent of NNS supplementation (-35%; 
incremental AUC, p ≤ 0.001). NNS+ ABX+ mice had augmented GLP-1 responses to 
intrajejunal glucose relative to other groups (69-108%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: 
These findings demonstrate that sub-acute NNS supplementation augments glucose 
absorption independent of gut microbiota in mice but does not disrupt glycemic 
responses. Antibiotic depletion of gut microbiota markedly increased glucose 
tolerance in mice, which may involve the actions of GLP-1.

White adipose tissue (WAT) and the gut are involved in the development of 
neuroinflammation when an organism detects any kind of injury, thereby 
triggering metainflammation. In fact, the autonomous nervous system innervates 
both tissues, although the complex role played by the integrated sympathetic, 
parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system functions have not been fully 
elucidated. Our aims were to investigate the participation of inflamed WAT and 
the gut in neuroinflammation. Firstly, we conducted an analysis into how 
inflamed peripheral WAT plays a key role in the triggering of metainflammation. 
Indeed, this included the impact of the development of local insulin resistance 
and its metabolic consequences, a serious hypothalamic dysfunction that promotes 
neurodegeneration. Then, we analyzed the gut-brain axis dysfunction involved in 
neuroinflammation by examining cell interactions, soluble factors, the sensing 
of microbes, and the role of dysbiosis-related mechanisms (intestinal microbiota 
and mucosal barriers) affecting brain functions. Finally, we targeted the 
physiological crosstalk between cells of the brain-WAT-gut axis that restores 
normal tissue homeostasis after injury. We concluded the following: because any 
injury can result not only in overall insulin resistance and dysbiosis, which in 
turn can impact upon the brain, but that a high-risk of the development of 
neuroinflammation-induced neurodegenerative disorder can also be triggered. 
Thus, it is imperative to avoid early metainflammation by applying appropriate 
preventive (e.g., lifestyle and diet) or pharmacological treatments to cope with 
allostasis and thus promote health homeostasis.

Gestational diabetes (GD) is a metabolic disorder characterized by glucose 
intolerance during pregnancy, significantly impacting maternal and fetal health. 
Its global prevalence is approximately 14%, with risk factors including obesity, 
family history of diabetes, advanced maternal age, and ethnicity, which are 
linked to cellular and molecular disruptions in glucose regulation and insulin 
resistance. GD is associated with short- and long-term complications for both 
the mother and the newborn. For mothers, GD increases the risk of developing 
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. In the 
offspring, exposure to GD in utero predisposes them to obesity, glucose 
intolerance, and metabolic disorders later in life. This review aims to 
elucidate the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying GD to inform 
the development of effective therapeutic strategies. A systematic review was 
conducted using medical subject headings (MeSH) terms related to GD's cellular 
and molecular pathophysiology. Inclusion criteria encompassed original studies, 
systematic reviews, and meta-analyses focusing on GD's impact on maternal and 
fetal health, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Data extraction captured study 
characteristics, maternal and fetal outcomes, key findings, and conclusions. GD 
disrupts insulin signaling pathways, leading to impaired glucose uptake and 
insulin resistance. Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP production and 
increases reactive oxygen species, exacerbating oxidative stress. Hormonal 
influences, chronic inflammation, and dysregulation of the mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway further impair insulin signaling. Gut microbiota 
alterations, gene expression, and epigenetic modifications play significant 
roles in GD. Ferroptosis and placental dysfunction primarily contribute to 
intrauterine growth restriction. Conversely, fetal macrosomia arises from 
maternal hyperglycemia and subsequent fetal hyperinsulinemia, resulting in 
excessive fetal growth. The chronic inflammatory state and oxidative stress 
associated with GD exacerbate these complications, creating a hostile 
intrauterine environment. GD's complex pathophysiology involves multiple 
disruptions in insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and 
oxidative stress. Effective management requires early detection, preventive 
strategies, and international collaboration to standardize care and improve 
outcomes for mothers and babies.

Obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR) can precipitate metabolic disorders such 
as diabetes. Zeaxanthin, a crucial member of the carotenoid family, has been 
found to mitigate the damage caused by obesity. However, reports on the effects 
of zeaxanthin on obesity-induced IR are lacking. Our objective was to examine 
the metabolic regulatory impacts of zeaxanthin on mice subjected to a high-fat 
diet (HFD) that triggered IR and to explore their influence on gut microbiota 
regulation. This study constructed a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction caused 
by lipid-rich nutritional patterns to investigate physiological and biochemical 
indices, liver pathway expression, and the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms 
by which zeaxanthin improved both IR and glucose metabolic disorders were 
elucidated. The results demonstrate that zeaxanthin effectively suppressed 
obesity. The fasting blood glucose, area under curve of oral glucose tolerance 
test and insulin tolerance test, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR) indices in the HFDZEA group decreased by 14.9%, 25.2%, 
28.9%, and 29.8%. Additionally, zeaxanthin improved the lipid metabolism and 
alleviated damage to the liver and pancreas while also activating the PI3K/Akt 
pathway, regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and the glycogen metabolism. The 
number of OTUs in the HFDZEA group increased by 29.04%. Zeaxanthin improved the 
structure and profile of the gastrointestinal microbiome and enhanced its 
diversity, increasing probiotics abundance, decreasing pathogen abundance, and 
thereby ameliorating the dysbiosis of enteric microbial communities in rodents 
with obesity resulting from excessive fat consumption. The outcomes of our 
analysis provide a rational basis for advancing zeaxanthin-based nutritional 
products.

As of 2024, arterial hypertension is still considered the leading modifiable 
cardiovascular risk factor and, due to high rates of undertreatment and poor 
blood pressure control, the major contributor to human morbidity and mortality. 
Development of new treatment options and better interventions in lifestyle 
correction have become a priority of experimental and clinical research. In the 
last decades, dietary supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(ω-3 PUFAs) and generation of gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs) have surged as potential and promising interventions for hypertension 
and cardiovascular prevention. ω-3 PUFAs are considered "essential" fatty acids 
that can be obtained only from dietary sources. Although previous intervention 
trials were not consistent in reporting a significant benefit of ω-3 PUFAs, the 
recent REDUCE-IT trial has provided robust evidence in support of their role in 
cardiovascular prevention. Recent studies have also identified the intestinal 
microbiota as a potential player in the pathophysiology and progression of 
hypertension. Although this might occur through many pathways, generation of 
SCFAs that is highly dependent on dietary fiber intake is primarily involved, 
providing an additional target for the development of novel therapeutic 
strategies. For these reasons, some scientific societies currently recommend 
dietary supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs and fiber-containing foods in patients with 
hypertension. In this narrative review, we summarize the results of studies that 
examined the effects of ω-3 PUFAs and SCFAs on blood pressure, highlighting the 
mechanisms of action on the vascular system and their possible impact on 
hypertension, hypertension-related organ damage and, ultimately, cardiovascular 
outcomes.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic disease and one of the diseases 
with the highest number of complications at present. As the disease progresses, 
patients will gradually develop diabetes-related cognitive decline, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or even dementia. The occurrence of diabetes-combined 
cognitive impairment undoubtedly imposes a heavy burden on patients and their 
families. Current research suggests that risk factors such as blood glucose 
levels, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have an 
important role in the development of diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI). With 
the development of technology and in-depth research, the relationship between 
the two-way communication between the gut and the brain has been gradually 
revealed, and more studies have found that the gut microbiota plays an important 
role in the development of DCI. This review explores the feasibility of 
probiotics as a potential strategy to assist in the improvement of DCI and its 
potential mechanisms from the perspective of the factors affecting DCI.

The human gut harbors a complex and diverse microbiota essential for maintaining 
health. Diet is the most significant modifiable factor influencing gut 
microbiota composition and function, particularly through bioactive compounds 
like polyphenols, dietary fibers, and carotenoids found in vegetables, fruits, 
seafood, coffee, and green tea. These compounds regulate the gut microbiota by 
promoting beneficial bacteria and suppressing harmful ones, leading to the 
production of key microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty 
acids, bile acid derivatives, and tryptophan metabolites. These metabolites are 
crucial for gut homeostasis, influencing gut barrier function, immune responses, 
energy metabolism, anti-inflammatory processes, lipid digestion, and modulation 
of gut inflammation. This review outlines the regulatory impact of typical 
bioactive compounds on the gut microbiota and explores the connection between 
specific microbiota-derived metabolites and overall health. We discuss how 
dietary interventions can affect disease development and progression through 
mechanisms involving these metabolites. We examine the roles of bioactive 
compounds and their metabolites in the prevention and treatment of diseases 
including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study provides new 
insights into disease prevention and underscores the potential of dietary 
modulation of the gut microbiota as a strategy for improving health.

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has emerged as a global 
public health dilemma. This ailment is associated with insulin resistance and 
heightened blood glucose concentrations. Despite the rapid advancements in 
modern medicine, where a regimen of medications is employed to manage blood 
glucose effectively, certain treatments manifest significant adverse reactions. 
Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of gallotannins in mitigating 
inflammation and obesity, potentially reducing the prevalence of obesity-linked 
T2DM. Gallotannins, defined by their glycosidic cores and galloyl groups, are 
ubiquitously present in plants, playing diverse biological functions and 
constituting a significant segment of water-soluble polyphenolic compounds 
within the heterogeneous tannins group. The structural attributes of 
gallotannins are instrumental in dictating their myriad biological activities. 
Owing to their abundance of hydroxyl groups (-OH) and complex macromolecular 
structure, gallotannins exhibit an array of pro-physiological properties, 
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, protein-precipitating, 
and antibacterial effects. Extensive research demonstrates that gallotannins 
specifically obstruct α-amylase and pancreatic lipase, enhance insulin 
sensitivity, modulate short-chain fatty acid production, alleviate oxidative 
stress, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and influence the gut microbiota, 
collectively contributing to their antidiabetic efficacy. This review aims to 
consolidate and scrutinize the extant literature on gallotannins to furnish 
essential insights for their potential application in diabetes management.

The human gut microbiota, the vast community of microbes inhabiting the 
gastrointestinal tract, plays a pivotal role in maintaining health. Bacteria are 
the most abundant organism, and the composition of bacterial communities is 
strongly influenced by diet. Gut bacteria can degrade complex dietary 
carbohydrates to produce bioactive compounds such as short-chain fatty acids. 
Such products influence health, by acting on systemic metabolism, or by virtue 
of anti-inflammatory or anti-carcinogenic properties. The composition of gut 
bacteria can be altered through overgrowth of enteropathogens (e.g., 
Campylobacter, Salmonella spp.), leading to dysbiosis of the gut ecosystem, with 
some species thriving under the altered conditions whereas others decline. 
Various "biotics" strategies, including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and 
postbiotics, contribute to re-establishing balance within the gut microbial 
ecosystem conferring health benefits. Prebiotics enhance growth of beneficial 
members of the resident microbial community and can thus prevent pathogen growth 
by competitive exclusion. Specific probiotics can actively inhibit the growth of 
pathogens, either through the production of bacteriocins or simply by reducing 
the gastrointestinal pH making conditions less favorable for pathogen growth. 
This review discusses the importance of a balanced gut ecosystem, and strategies 
to maintain it that contribute to human health.

BACKGROUND The gastrointestinal (GI) barrier can be damaged by chemotherapy or 
radiation therapy, causing fatigue, malnutrition, sepsis, dose-limiting 
toxicity, and, occasionally, death. Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) promotes 
mucosal epithelium growth and repair in the GI tract. Here, we examined the 
GI-protective effects of apraglutide, a long-acting peptide GLP-2 analog, in 
murine models of chemotherapy, and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic 
transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The impact of apraglutide on cytarabine or 
melphalan chemotherapy-induced intestinal damage was assessed in BALB/c mice, 
and the effect on allogeneic transplantation in BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice. 
Outcomes included survival, and changes in body weight, intestinal function and 
morphology, including colon length and bacterial composition of the intestinal 
microbiota. RESULTS Adding apraglutide to chemotherapy significantly improved 
survival rates and reduced weight loss, with no impact on leukocyte counts (and, 
therefore, no effect on chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression), compared with 
chemotherapy alone in mice. These benefits were associated with preservation of 
the morphological integrity of the GI mucosa, attenuation of the negative impact 
of cytarabine on the intestinal microbiota, and significant improvement in 
plasma levels of citrulline. In addition, in a model of irradiation followed by 
allogeneic transplantation, mice in groups receiving apraglutide had improved 
survival, reduced weight loss, and increased colon length compared with those 
that did not. CONCLUSIONS Apraglutide protects intestinal function and improves 
survival in mice following allogeneic transplantation or chemotherapy with 
cytarabine or melphalan. The potential effect of apraglutide on chemotherapy 
efficacy and on engraftment following allogeneic transplantation has been 
investigated in a parallel manuscript.

Imidazole Propionate (ImP), a gut-derived metabolite from histidine, affects 
insulin signaling in mice and is elevated in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the 
source of histidine and the role of the gut microbiota remain unclear. We 
conducted an intervention study in mice and humans, comparing ImP kinetics in 
mice on a high-fat diet with varying histidine levels and antibiotics, and 
assessed ImP levels in healthy and T2D subjects with histidine supplementation. 
Results show that dietary histidine is metabolized to ImP, with 
antibiotic-induced gut microbiota suppression reducing ImP levels in mice. In 
contrast, oral histidine supplementation resulted in increases in circulating 
ImP levels in humans, whereas antibiotic treatment increased ImP levels, which 
was associated with a bloom of several bacterial genera that have been 
associated with ImP production, such as Lactobacilli. Our findings highlight the 
gut microbiota's crucial role in regulating ImP and the complexity of 
translating mouse models to humans.

Members of the Bacteroidota compose a large portion of the human gut microbiota, 
contributing to overall gut health via the degradation of various 
polysaccharides. This process is facilitated by lipoproteins, globular proteins 
anchored to the cell surface by a lipidated N-terminal cysteine. Despite their 
importance, lipoprotein synthesis by these bacteria is understudied. In 
Escherichia coli, the α-amino-linked lipid of lipoproteins is added by the 
lipoprotein N-acyltransferase Lnt. Herein, we have identified a protein distinct 
from Lnt responsible for the same process in Bacteroides, named lipoprotein 
N-acyltransferase in Bacteroides (Lnb). Deletion of Lnb yields cells that 
synthesize diacylated lipoproteins, with impacts on cell viability and 
morphology, growth on polysaccharides, and protein composition of membranes and 
outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Our results not only challenge the accepted 
paradigms of lipoprotein biosynthesis in gram-negative bacteria but also suggest 
the existence of a new family of lipoprotein N-acyltransferases.
