Growth and aging are fundamental elements of human development. Aging is defined 
by a decrease in physiological activities and higher illness vulnerability. 
Affected by lifestyle, environmental, and hereditary elements, aging results in 
disorders including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurological diseases, 
which accounted for 16.1 million worldwide deaths in 2019. Stress-induced 
cellular senescence, caused by DNA damage, can reduce tissue regeneration and 
repair, promoting aging. The root cause of many age-related disorders is 
inflammation, encouraged by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP). Aging's metabolic changes and declining immune systems raise illness 
risk via promoting microbiome diversity. Stable, individual-specific skin and 
oral microbiomes are essential for both health and disease since dysbiosis is 
linked with periodontitis and eczema. Present from birth to death, the human 
microbiome, under the influence of diet and lifestyle, interacts symbiotically 
with the body. Poor dental health has been linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases since oral microorganisms and systemic diseases have important 
interactions. Emphasizing the importance of microbiome health across the 
lifetime, this study reviews the understanding of the microbiome's role in 
aging-related diseases that can direct novel diagnosis and treatment approaches.

BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel treatment for 
inflammatory diseases. Herein, we assess its safety, efficacy, and immunological 
impact in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we 
performed the efficacy and safety assessment of FMT for moderate-to-severe adult 
patients with AD. All patients received FMT or placebo once a week for 3 weeks, 
in addition to their standard background treatments. Patients underwent disease 
severity assessments at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16, and blood and fecal 
samples were collected for immunologic analysis and metagenomic shotgun 
sequencing, respectively. Safety was monitored throughout the trial.
RESULTS: Improvements in eczema area and severity index (EASI) scores and 
percentage of patients achieving EASI 50 (50% reduction in EASI score) were 
greater in patients treated with FMT than in placebo-treated patients. No 
serious adverse reactions occurred during the trial. FMT treatment decreased the 
Th2 and Th17 cell proportions among the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 
the levels of TNF-α, and total IgE in serum. By contrast, the expression levels 
of IL-12p70 and perforin on NK cells were increased. Moreover, FMT altered the 
abundance of species and functional pathways of the gut microbiota in the 
patients, especially the abundance of Megamonas funiformis and the pathway for 
1,4-dihydroxy-6-naphthoate biosynthesis II.
CONCLUSION: FMT was a safe and effective therapy in moderate-to-severe adult 
patients with AD; the treatment changed the gut microbiota compositions and 
functions.

Argan oil, rich in unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, exerts beneficial 
effects on both the intestinal and skin microbiotas. In the gut, it promotes the 
growth of beneficial bacteria, such as lactobacilli, while reducing pathogenic 
bacteria, due to its anti-inflammatory properties that help maintain microbial 
balance. Additionally, it improves the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, 
reducing the risk of dysbiosis. On the skin, argan oil hydrates and balances the 
lipid environment, creating a favorable setting for beneficial microorganisms, 
while also possessing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that soothe 
conditions like eczema and acne. Thus, argan oil is valuable for overall health, 
supporting digestion and skin health. The objective of this review is to provide 
a summary of the benefits of argan oil for alternative and complementary 
medicine. An exhaustive search of the literature was carried out using targeted 
keywords. A set of 83 articles were selected and analyzed. As the mechanisms of 
action of argan oil are not completely understood, this work highlighted the 
benefits of this oil by analyzing its nutritional properties and its beneficial 
effects on the intestinal and skin microbiotas. Indeed, argan oil is valuable 
for overall health.

The skin plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and protecting against 
external aggressors. Recent research has highlighted the potential of probiotics 
and postbiotics in dermatological treatments and skincare. These beneficial 
microorganisms interact with the skin microbiota, modulate the immune response, 
and enhance the skin barrier, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for 
various skin conditions, such as acne, dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. This 
bibliometric study aims to analyze the global trends and scientific impact of 
topical probiotics in dermatology. By reviewing 106 articles published between 
2013 and 2023, the study categorizes the applications of probiotics in wound 
healing, inflammatory skin diseases, and general skincare. The findings indicate 
a significant increase in publications from 2021 onwards, attributed to the 
heightened focus on medical research during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study 
also identifies the most productive countries, institutions, and authors in this 
field, highlighting the importance of international collaborations. The results 
underscore the efficacy of probiotic-based topical formulations in improving 
skin health, reducing inflammation, and enhancing wound healing. This 
comprehensive analysis supports the development of new therapeutic strategies 
based on topical probiotics and encourages high-quality research in this 
promising area.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease that commonly appears during 
childhood but can present at any age. There are interventions that are effective 
in treating AD in children, but it has been difficult to find effective 
treatments for adults. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to 
determine the efficacy of topical probiotic treatment for AD in adult 
populations. A database search was conducted of peer-reviewed, double-blind 
clinical trials, and studies underwent a systematic exclusion and inclusion 
process, yielding four that met the criteria. Disease severity, as measured by a 
standardized scoring tool SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), was culled from 
each study and compared to placebo at two-week and four-week time points. All 
studies showed improvement in SCORAD in the treatment groups compared to 
baseline at all time points. Two showed significant decreases in SCORAD after 
two weeks of treatment, and three studies showed long-lasting improvement after 
four weeks of treatment. Interestingly, while each study showed a reduction in 
the severity of AD at the two- and four-week time points, a pooled meta-analysis 
did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and 
control at four weeks of treatment. Clinically, there may be benefits to topical 
probiotic usage as evidenced by the individual studies; more studies need to be 
performed including adults to show statistical significance.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex immune-mediated abnormality of the skin 
characterized by impaired barrier function, eczematous dermatitis, chronic 
pruritus and itch. The immunological response in AD is mediated by a 
Th2-dominated immune response in the early acute phase followed by a Th1/ Th2 
mixed immune response in the chronic phase. AD is the first step of the "atopic 
march" that progresses into food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. 
Different models are indispensable for studying AD pathogenesis and for 
designing pre-clinical studies for therapeutic discovery. They reflect the 
characteristic morphological features of typical human AD with regard to 
epidermal thickening, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and spongiosis and help 
understand the immunopathogenesis of the disease with respect to IgE levels and 
cellular infiltration of eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. Although it 
is difficult to replicate all human AD clinical features in a model, several AD 
in vivo models comprising spontaneous, induced, transgenic, and humanized and in 
vitro models, including 2D, co-culture, and 3D, have been described previously. 
However, several questions remain regarding whether these models satisfactorily 
reflect the complexity of human AD. Therefore, this review comprehensively 
highlights the diversity of currently available models and provides insights 
into the selection of suitable models based on research questions. It also 
summarizes the diverse mechanisms associated with each model, which may be 
valuable for better study design to test new therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: More than 50% of patients with hand eczema (HE) are colonized with 
Staphylococcus aureus. Comprehensive knowledge of the skin microbiome and its 
changes in patients with HE may provide insights into future potential 
therapeutical targets.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the skin microbiome in patients with moderate-to-severe 
chronic HE and assess its changes following treatment with topical 
corticosteroids (TCS).
METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from lesional and nonlesional skin 
before and after 2 weeks of TCS treatment using ESwabs and analysed by 16S rRNA 
and tuf gene sequencing. Clinically, the disease severity was assessed by the 
Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI).
RESULTS: A cohort of 31 patients with HE were included and followed up. Compared 
to nonlesional skin, lesional skin differed in overall bacterial community 
composition (p = 0.02), displayed higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus, 
in particular S. aureus (p = 0.01) and lower abundance of Micrococcus 
(p = 0.02). As disease severity improved with treatment, these microbial 
characteristics on lesional skin shifted towards that of nonlesional skin on the 
hands.
CONCLUSION: The bacterial skin microbiome was altered in lesions of HE and 
partly driven by S. aureus colonization, however, shifted towards nonlesional 
skin following treatment. Our results emphasize the future possibilities for 
anti-S. aureus treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin condition 
characterized by widely variable cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus abundance that 
contributes to disease severity and rapidly responds to type 2 immune blockade 
(ie, dupilumab). The molecular mechanisms regulating S aureus levels between AD 
subjects remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated host genes that may be predictive of S aureus 
abundance and correspond with AD severity.
METHODS: We studied data derived from the National Institutes of Health/National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded (NCT03389893 [ADRN-09]) 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of dupilumab in 
adults (n = 71 subjects) with moderate-to-severe AD. Bulk RNA sequencing of skin 
biopsy samples (n = 57 lesional, 55 nonlesional) was compared to epidermal S 
aureus abundance, lipidomic, and AD clinical measures.
RESULTS: S aureus abundance and ceramide synthase 1 (CERS1) expression 
positively correlated at baseline across both nonlesional (r = 0.29, P = .030) 
and lesional (r = 0.41, P = .0015) skin. Lesional CERS1 expression also 
positively correlated with AD severity (ie, SCORAD r = 0.44, P = .0006) and skin 
barrier dysfunction (transepidermal water loss area under the curve r = 0.31, 
P = .025) at baseline. CERS1 expression (forms C18:0 sphingolipids) was 
negatively associated with elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (ELOVL6; 
C16:0→C18:0) expression and corresponded with a shorter chain length 
sphingolipid composition. Dupilumab rapidly reduced CERS1 expression (day 7) and 
ablated the relationship with S aureus abundance and ELOVL6 expression by day 
21.
CONCLUSION: CERS1 is a unique molecular biomarker of S aureus abundance and AD 
severity that may contribute to dysfunctional skin barrier and shorter-chain 
sphingolipid composition through fatty acid sequestration as a maladaptive 
compensatory response to reduced ELOVL6.

The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) has a greater diversity of 
mycobiota. An observational, prospective, cross-sectional, analytical, and 
comparative study was conducted involving 80 patients with AD Group (ADG) and 50 
individuals without AD (wADG) in a tertiary hospital in Brazil. Skin scale 
samples were collected from the frontal, cervical, fossae cubital, and popliteal 
regions and identified using molecular biology techniques. The results showed 
that 47.5% of ADG had identified yeasts compared to 0% of wADG (P < .001). The 
yeasts Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Candida parapsilosis were the most abundant. 
The probability of colonization increased with age, showing values of 40% at 60 
months and 80% at 220 months (P = .09). The cervical region (12.5%) was 
colonized to the greatest extent. Our findings revealed that positive mycology 
was not more probable when the scoring of atopic dermatitis or eczema area and 
severity index value increased (P = .23 and .53, respectively). The results 
showed that the sex, age, and different population types directly affected the 
composition of the mycobiota in the population analyzed. A higher frequency of 
colonization and greater diversity of yeast species were detected in the 
cutaneous mycobiota of children with AD.

Plain Language Summary: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease that can be 
colonized by microorganisms. We evaluated patients with and without the disease 
and found a higher frequency of colonization by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and 
Candida parapsilosis on the skin of children with AD.

Probiotics have garnered increasing attention, particularly within the realm of 
atopic dermatitis (AD). Although classified as dietary supplements by the Food 
and Drug Administration, probiotics are being explored for their potential to 
modify immune system responses and aid in disease recovery. This review aims to 
provide a current understanding of probiotics, specifically various lactobacilli 
strains, as a therapeutic option in preventing and treating AD. The concept of 
the gut-skin axis has gained substantial recognition, emphasizing the complex 
relationship between the gut microbiome and skin health. Dysfunctional gut 
barriers and metabolites produced by gut microorganisms can exert profound 
influences on skin conditions, including AD. Lactobacilli species are 
particularly noteworthy for their resilience and stability within the 
gastrointestinal tract, making these bacteria ideal candidates for probiotic 
supplementation. Various lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus salivarius, 
Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, 
and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) were included in this study due to their current 
uses in mitigating AD symptomatology. This systemic review article aims to shed 
light on the potential of probiotics as a therapeutic approach for AD, 
highlighting their stellar safety profile and promising therapeutic efficacy. 
Given the compelling preliminary findings and the constraints associated with 
conventional treatments, probiotics, particularly lactobacilli strains, emerge 
as a considerable alternative or adjuvant option for individuals grappling with 
AD. Further exploration is imperative to establish probiotics as a promising 
therapeutic option, providing renewed hope for those seeking effective 
strategies for managing AD.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease characterized by dry, pruritic skin 
and significant atopic and psychological sequelae. Although AD has always been 
viewed as multifactorial, early research was dominated by overlapping genetic 
determinist views of either innate barrier defects leading to inflammation or 
innate inflammation eroding skin barrier function. Since 1970, however, the 
incidence of AD in the United States has increased at a pace that far exceeds 
genetic drift, thus suggesting a modern, environmental etiology. Another 
implicated factor is Staphylococcus aureus; however, a highly contagious 
microorganism is unlikely to be the primary etiology of a noncommunicable 
disease. Recently, the roles of the skin and gut microbiomes have received 
greater attention as potentially targetable drivers of AD. Here too, however, 
dysbiosis on a population scale would require induction by an environmental 
factor. In this review, we describe the evidence supporting the environmental 
hypothesis of AD etiology and detail the molecular mechanisms of each of the 
AD-relevant toxins. We also outline how a pollution-focused paradigm demands 
earnest engagement with environmental injustice if the field is to meaningfully 
address racial and geographic disparities. Identifying specific toxins and their 
mechanisms can also inform in-home and national mitigation strategies.

Head and neck dermatitis (HND) is a form of atopic dermatitis (AD) that affects 
the seborrheic areas of the body and causes greater quality of life detriments 
than other types of AD. HND can be challenging to treat since first-line topical 
therapies may be ineffective or intolerable for long-term use on areas affected 
by HND while dupilumab may cause dupilumab-associated HND (DAHND). Current 
evidence implicates fungi, particularly Malassezia spp., in the pathogenesis of 
HND. Penetration of fungal antigens through the defective AD skin barrier 
activates the innate and adaptive immune systems to cause cutaneous inflammation 
via the T helper (Th)17 and/or Th2 axes. Malassezia sensitization may 
distinguish HND from other forms of AD. Multiple double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials have shown antifungals to benefit HND, yet the 
persistence of symptom relief with sustained use remains unclear. Oral 
antifungals appear more effective than topical antifungals but may be harmful 
with long-term use. DAHND may also be fungal-mediated given improvement with 
antifungals and evidence of an overactive immune response against Malassezia in 
these patients. Janus kinase inhibitors are effective for HND, including DAHND, 
but may cause significant side effects when administered systemically. 
OX40/OX40L inhibitors and tralokinumab may be promising options for HND on the 
horizon. Demographic and environmental factors influence the host mycobiome and 
should be considered in future precision-medicine approaches as microbiome 
composition and diversity are linked to severity of HND.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), known as eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin 
condition affecting millions worldwide. This abstract provides an overview of 
the clinical features and underlying pathogenesis of AD, highlighting the role 
of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in its development and progression. AD presents 
with distinct clinical manifestations that evolve with age, starting in infancy 
with dry, itchy skin and red patches, which can lead to sleep disturbances. In 
childhood, the rash spreads to flexural areas, resulting in lichenification. In 
adulthood, lesions may localize to specific areas, including the hands and 
eyelids. Pruritus (itchiness) is a hallmark symptom, often leading to 
excoriations and increased vulnerability to skin infections. The pathogenesis of 
AD is multifaceted, involving genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. 
Skin barrier dysfunction, immune dysregulation, genetic predisposition, 
microbiome alterations, and environmental triggers contribute to its 
development. Recent research has uncovered the role of miRNAs, such as 
miR-10a-5p, miR-29b, miR-124, miR-143, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a, miR-155, and 
miR-223, in AD pathogenesis. These microRNAs play crucial roles in regulating 
various aspects of immune responses, keratinocyte dynamics, and inflammation. 
MicroRNA-10a-5p orchestrates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, 
while miR-29b regulates keratinocyte apoptosis and barrier integrity. 
MicroRNA-124 exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by targeting the NF-κB signaling 
pathway. MicroRNANA-143 counters allergic inflammation by modulating IL-13 
signaling. MicroRNA-146a-5p regulates immune responses and correlates with IgE 
levels in AD. MicroRNA-151a shows diagnostic potential and modulates IL-12 
receptor β2. MicroRNA-155 plays a central role in immune responses and Th17 cell 
differentiation, offering diagnostic and therapeutic potential. MicroRNA-223 is 
linked to prenatal smoke exposure and immune modulation in AD. Understanding 
these microRNAs' intricate roles in AD pathogenesis promises more effective 
treatments, personalized approaches, and enhanced diagnostic tools. Further 
research into these molecular orchestrators may transform the landscape of AD 
management, improving the quality of life for affected individuals.

The recent rise in hand sanitizer use due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a 
beneficial impact on stopping the spread of disease, but the potential negative 
implications of its overuse on the body and the microbiome have yet to be 
thoroughly reviewed. Epidermal layers absorb hand sanitizer from direct 
application to the skin, making them some of the most susceptible cells to the 
adverse effects of overuse. The increased usage of hand sanitizer can affect the 
variation, quantity, and diversity of the skin microflora, leading to conditions 
such as eczema, atopic dermatitis, and even systemic toxicity due to 
colonization of the skin with pathogenic bacteria. Due to the close-knit 
relationship between the skin and gut, the gastrointestinal system can also 
incur disruptions due to the negative effects on the skin as a result of 
excessive hand sanitizer use, leading to gut dysbiosis. Additionally, the 
accidental ingestion of hand sanitizer, and its abuse or misuse, can be toxic 
and lead to alcohol poisoning, which is an issue most commonly seen not only in 
the pediatric population but also in adolescents and adults due to aberrant 
recreational exposure. As a vulnerable body system, the eyes can also be 
negatively impacted by hand sanitizer misuse leading to chemical injury, visual 
impairment, and even blindness. In this review, we aim to highlight the 
variations in hand sanitizer formulation, the benefits, and how misuse or 
overuse may lead to adverse effects on the skin, gut, and eyes. In particular, 
we review the advantages and disadvantages of alcohol-based hand sanitizers 
(ABHSs) and non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers (NABHSs) and how the components 
and chemicals used in each can contribute to organ dysbiosis and systemic 
damage.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a high 
prevalence worldwide. AD pathogenesis is complex and consists of immune system 
dysregulation and impaired skin barrier, influenced by genetic and environmental 
factors. The purpose of the review is to show the complex interplay between 
atopic dermatitis and the microbiota. Human microbiota plays an important role 
in AD pathogenesis and the course of the disease. Dysbiosis is an important 
factor contributing to the development of atopic diseases, including atopic 
dermatitis. The gut microbiota can influence the composition of the skin 
microbiota, strengthening the skin barrier and regulating the immune response 
via the involvement of bacterial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty 
acids, in signaling pathways of the gut-skin axis. AD can be modulated by 
antibiotic intake, dietary adjustments, hygiene, and living conditions. One of 
the promising strategies for modulating the course of AD is probiotics. This 
review offers a summary of how the microbiota influences the development and 
treatment of AD, highlighting aspects that warrant additional investigation.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), a prevalent Th2-dominant skin disease, involves complex 
genetic and environmental factors, including mutations in the Filaggrin gene and 
dysbiosis of skin microbiota characterized by an increased abundance of 
Staphylococcus aureus. Our recent findings emphasize the pivotal role of the 
skin barrier's integrity and microbial composition in infantile AD and allergic 
diseases. Early skin dysbiosis predisposes infants to AD, suggesting targeted 
skincare practices as a preventive strategy. The effects of skincare 
interventions, particularly the application of moisturizers with the appropriate 
molar concentration of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids, play a crucial 
role in restoring the skin barrier. Notably, our study revealed that appropriate 
skincare can reduce Streptococcus abundance while supporting Cutibacterium acnes 
presence, thus directly linking skincare practices to microbial modulation in 
neonatal skin. Despite the mixed outcomes of previous Randomized Controlled 
Trials on the efficacy of moisturizers in AD prevention, our research points to 
the potential of skincare intervention as a primary preventive method against AD 
by minimizing the impact of genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, our 
research supports the notion that early aggressive management of eczema may 
reduce the incidence of food allergies, highlighting the necessity for 
multifaceted prevention strategies that address both the skin barrier and immune 
sensitization. By focusing on repairing the skin barrier and adjusting the 
skin's microbiome from birth, we propose a novel perspective on preventing 
infantile AD and allergic diseases, opening new avenues for future studies, and 
practices in allergy prevention.

Pediatric dermatitis seborrhoica (DS) is a common inflammatory disorder of 
infancy and adolescence distinct from atopic dermatitis. We performed a 
narrative review on clinical and therapeutic aspects of the disease. The 
prevalence varies geographically and can reach up to 10%. There is a slight male 
predominance. Although etiopathology is not well known, both endogenous and 
exogenous factors contribute. Skin microbiome and its interaction with sebaceous 
gland function is crucial. The inflammatory pathways include innate immune 
function and skin barrier disturbances. Malassezia spp. and certain bacteria are 
increased in lesional skin. DS develops in different clinical subtypes, from 
localized cephalic to disseminated disease with a risk of erythroderma and 
eczema herpeticatum. Treatment consists of skin care and topical and rarely 
systemic medical therapy. Cornerstones of treatment are antifungals and mild 
corticosteroids. Targeted treatment is on the horizon. Pediatric DS is a common 
disorder important in the differential diagnosis of skin problems in infants and 
and children. Due to better understanding of its pathogenesis, new treatment 
options are developed.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder influenced by 
genetic predisposition, environmental factors, immune dysregulation, and skin 
barrier dysfunction. The skin microbiome and metabolome play crucial roles in 
modulating the skin's immune environment and integrity. However, their specific 
contributions to AD remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the distinct skin 
microbial communities and skin metabolic compounds in AD patients compared to 
healthy controls (HCs). Seven patients with AD patients and seven HCs were 
enrolled, from whom skin samples were obtained for examination. The study 
involved 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis as well as 
the use of gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) to 
detect metabolites associated with AD in the skin. We observed significant 
differences in microbial diversity between lesional and non-lesional skin of AD 
patients and HCs. Staphylococcus overgrowth was prominent in AD lesions, while 
Cutibacterium levels were decreased. Metabolomic analysis revealed elevated 
levels of several metabolites, including hypoxanthine and glycerol-3-phosphate 
in AD lesions, indicating perturbations in purine metabolism and energy 
production pathways. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between 
hypoxanthine and glycerol-3-phosphate and clinical severity of AD and 
Staphylococcus overgrowth. These findings suggest potential biomarkers for 
monitoring AD severity. Further research is needed to elucidate the causal 
relationships between microbial dysbiosis, metabolic alterations, and AD 
progression, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to consolidate evidence on 
dietary interventions for atopic eczema/dermatitis (AD) skin symptoms in 
children without food allergies, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Systematic 
review updates were conducted in May 2022 and June 2023, focusing on randomized 
placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) involving children with AD but without food 
allergies. Specific diets or supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, 
probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, or postbiotics, were explored in these 
trials. Exclusions comprised descriptive studies, systematic reviews, 
meta-analyses, letters, case reports, studies involving elimination diets, and 
those reporting on food allergens in children and adolescents. Additionally, 
studies assessing exacerbation of AD due to food allergy/sensitization and those 
evaluating elimination diets' effects on AD were excluded. Nutritional 
supplementation studies were eligible regardless of sensitization profile. 
Evaluation of their impact on AD clinical expression was performed using SCORAD 
scores, and a meta-analysis of SCORAD outcomes was conducted using random-effect 
models (CRD42022328702). The review encompassed 27 RCTs examining prebiotics, 
Vitamin D, evening primrose oil, and substituting cow's milk formula with 
partially hydrolyzed whey milk formula. A meta-analysis of 20 RCTs assessing 
probiotics, alone or combined with prebiotics, revealed a significant reduction 
in SCORAD scores, suggesting a consistent trend in alleviating AD symptoms in 
children without food allergies. Nonetheless, evidence for other dietary 
interventions remains limited, underscoring the necessity for well-designed 
intervention studies targeting multiple factors to understand etiological 
interactions and propose reliable manipulation strategies.

Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis [AD]) affect 
children and adults globally. In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple 
levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunologic, and microbial 
components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial 
microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with 
Staphylococcus aureus. The secretion of virulence factors, such as toxins and 
proteases, by S aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and 
additionally disrupts the balance of an already skewed immune response. Skin 
commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S 
aureus through quorum sensing. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome 
could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and 
indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the 
skin pH; UV treatment; and use of prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics. 
Furthermore, exploratory techniques such as skin microbiome transplantation, 
ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed. Finally, we summarize the latest 
findings on disease and microbiome modification through targeted 
immunomodulatory systemic treatments and biologics. We believe that targeting 
the skin microbiome should be considered a crucial component of successful AD 
treatment in the future.

This chapter will describe infectious complications of atopic dermatitis, 
including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections and the evolving understanding 
of the relationship between atopic dermatitis and infectious disease. The 
underlying immunological dysregulation and poor skin barrier function associated 
with atopic dermatitis not only increase the likelihood of infectious 
complications but also lend atopic dermatitis skin vulnerable to flares induced 
by environmental triggers. Thus, this chapter will also highlight the impact of 
common external environmental agents on precipitating flares of disease. Lastly, 
this chapter will discuss complications that can arise from treatments and the 
association of atopic dermatitis with more serious conditions such as lymphoma.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease 
characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. We review emerging concepts and 
clinical evidence addressing the pathogenesis and prevention of AD. We examine 
several interventions ranging from skin barrier enhancement strategies to 
probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; and conversely, from antimicrobial 
exposure to vitamin D and omega fatty acid supplementation; breastfeeding and 
hydrolyzed formula; and house dust mite avoidance and immunotherapy. We appraise 
the available evidence base within the context of the Grades of Recommendation, 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We also contextualize our 
findings in relation to concepts relating AD and individual-patient allergic 
life trajectories versus a linear concept of the atopic march and provide 
insights into future knowledge gaps and clinical trial design considerations 
that must be addressed in forthcoming research. Finally, we provide 
implementation considerations to detect population-level differences in AD risk. 
Major international efforts are required to provide definitive evidence 
regarding what works and what does not for preventing AD.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease 
characterized by dry, pruritic skin. In the U.S., the prevalence of AD has 
increased over three-fold since the 1970s. We previously reported a geographic 
association between isocyanate-containing air pollution and AD as well as 
mechanistic data demonstrating that isocyanates induce skin dysbiosis and 
activate the host itch receptor TRPA1. However, non-spatial models are 
susceptible to spatial confounding and may overlook other meaningful 
associations.
METHODS: We added spatial analysis to our prior model, contrasting pollution 
data with clinical visits. In addition, we conducted a retrospective 
case-control survey of childhood exposure to BTEX-related products. Finally, we 
assessed implicated compounds, in pure form and as part of synthetic fabric, for 
their effect on the growth and metabolism of skin commensal bacteria.
RESULTS: Spatial analysis implicate benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and, most 
significantly, xylene (BTEX) compounds. Survey odds ratios for AD were 
significant for xylene-derived polyester bed sheets (OR = 9.5; CI 2.2-40.1) and 
diisocyanate-containing wallpaper adhesive (OR = 6.5; CI 1.5-27.8). 
Staphylococcus aureus lives longer on synthetic textiles compared to natural 
textiles. Meanwhile, synthetic fabric exposure shifts the lipid metabolism of 
health-associated commensals (Roseomonas mucosa and S. epidermidis) away from 
therapeutic pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that BTEX chemicals in their raw forms and in synthetic 
products represent a unifying hypothesis for environmentally induced AD flares 
through their ability to create dysbiosis in the skin microbiota and directly 
activate TRPA1. Unequal distribution of these pollutants may also influence 
racial disparities in AD rates.

Plain Language Summary: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory 
disease characterized by dry, itchy skin that has become increasingly more 
common since around 1970. We aimed to identify chemicals that may cause atopic 
dermatitis (eczema). Building on prior work, we discovered that these chemicals 
could prevent the good bacteria that live on the skin from making the lipids and 
oils needed to keep human skin healthy. In this study, we combined new research 
methods with patient surveys. We link eczema to the chemical xylene, which is 
found in numerous home products. Exposure to xylene, benzene, or isocyanate 
containing fabrics (polyester, nylon, or spandex) disrupted the normal functions 
of skin bacteria. Our results indicate exposure to synthetic fabrics and other 
sources of these chemicals may contribute to eczema and deepen the understanding 
of how the environment can drive common diseases.

Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is the most common chronic skin disorder, 
characterized by red and pruritic lesions. Its etiology is multifaceted, 
involving an interplay of factors, such as the allergic immune response, skin 
barrier dysfunction, and dysbiosis of the skin microbiota. Recent studies have 
explored the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid 
bilayer-delimitated particles released by all cells, in atopic dermatitis. 
Examination of the available literature identified that most studies 
investigated EVs released by Staphylococcus aureus, which were found to impact 
the skin barrier and promote the release of cytokines that contribute to atopic 
dermatitis development. In addition, EVs released by the skin fungus, Malassezia 
sympodialis, were found to contain allergens, suggesting a potential 
contribution to allergic sensitization via the skin. The final major finding was 
the role of EVs released by mast cells, which were capable of activating various 
immune cells and attenuating the allergic response. While research in this area 
is still in its infancy, the studies examined in this review provide encouraging 
insights into how EVs released from a variety of cells play a role in both 
contributing to and protecting against atopic dermatitis.

Infectious and inflammatory dermatoses featuring skin lesions with loss of 
tissue expose skin layers to microbial invasions, disrupt the normal skin 
microbiome, and potentially lead to sepsis. However, literature data on the 
incidence of cutaneous-onset sepsis are scarce. This retrospective observational 
study assessed hospital admissions for primary skin lesions without bacterial 
infections and sepsis during 2020-2022 in the largest emergency hospital in NE 
Romania. Of 509 patients, 441 had infected lesions, 78 had sepsis caused by 
venous ulcers from microbial eczema cellulitis, superinfected bullous 
dermatoses, erysipelas, and erythroderma. Cultured samples revealed S. aureus, 
P. aeruginosa, and E. coli; and K. pneumoniae and S. β-hemolytic associated with 
sepsis, even if this was rarer. Clinical manifestations included ulcerations, 
erosions, fissures, excoriations, bullae, vesicles, pruritus, tumefaction, 
edema, fever, chills, pain, adenopathy, and mildly altered mental status. 
Underlying chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and type-1 
diabetes mellitus were comorbidities associated with infection and sepsis. 
Significant associations and risk factors, including their combined effects, are 
discussed to draw attention to the need for further research and adequate 
management to prevent sepsis in adult patients of any age presenting with 
infected skin lesions (especially cellulitis) and comorbidities (especially type 
1 diabetes mellitus and anemia).

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is an inflammatory skin disorder and eczema subtype 
increasingly recognized to be associated with significant physical, 
psychosocial, and financial burden. The full spectrum of SD, including dandruff 
localized to the scalp, is estimated to affect half of the world's population. 
Despite such high prevalence, the exact etiopathogenesis of SD remains unclear. 
Historically, many researchers have theorized a central, causative role of 
Malassezia spp. based on prior studies including the proliferation of Malassezia 
yeast on lesional skin of some SD patients and empiric clinical response to 
antifungal therapy. However, upon closer examination, many of these findings 
have not been reproducible nor consistent. Emerging data from novel, targeted 
anti-inflammatory therapeutics, as well as evidence from genome-wide association 
studies and murine models, should prompt a reevaluation of the popular 
yeast-centered hypothesis. Here, through focused review of the literature, 
including laboratory studies, clinical trials, and expert consensus, we examine 
and synthesize the data arguing for and against a primary role for Malassezia in 
SD. We propose an expansion of SD pathogenesis and suggest reframing our view of 
SD to be based primarily on dysregulation of the host immune system and skin 
epidermal barrier, like other eczemas.

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory cutaneous disease 
that arises due to dysregulation of the Th2 immune response, impaired skin 
barrier integrity, and dysbiosis of the skin and gut microbiota. An abundance of 
Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in AD lesions increases the Th2 immune response, 
and gut bacteria release breakdown products such as Short Chain Fatty Acids that 
regulate the systemic immune response.
AREAS COVERED: We aim to evaluate therapies that modulate the microbiome in 
humans and discuss the clinical implications of these treatments. We performed a 
review of the literature in which 2,673 records were screened, and describe the 
findings of 108 studies that were included after full-text review. All included 
studies discussed the effects of therapies on the human microbiome and AD 
severity. Oral probiotics, topical probiotics, biologics, and investigational 
therapies were included in our analysis.
EXPERT OPINION: Oral probiotics demonstrate mixed efficacy at relieving AD 
symptoms. Topical probiotics reduce S. aureus abundance in AD lesional skin, yet 
for moderate-severe disease, these therapies may not reduce AD severity scores 
to the standard of biologics. Dupilumab and tralokinumab target key inflammatory 
pathways in AD and modulate the skin microbiome, further improving disease 
severity.

Pruritus or itch is a defining symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD). The origins of 
itch are complex, and it is considered both a defense mechanism and a cause of 
disease that leads to inflammation and psychological stress. Considerable 
progress has been made in understanding the processes that trigger itch, 
particularly the pruritoceptive origins that are generated in the skin. This 
perspective review discusses the implications of a recent observation that the 
V8 protease expressed by Staphylococcus aureus can directly trigger sensory 
neurons in the skin through activation of protease-activated receptor 1. This 
may be a key to understanding why itch is so common in AD because S. aureus 
commonly overgrows in this disease owing to deficient antimicrobial defense from 
both the epidermis and the cutaneous microbiome. Increased understanding of the 
role of microbes in AD provides increased opportunities for safely improving the 
treatment of this disorder.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a recurrent, chronic, inflammatory, itchy skin 
disorder that affects up to 20% of the pediatric population and 10% of the adult 
population worldwide. Onset typically occurs early in life, and although 
cardinal disease features are similar across all ages, different age groups and 
ethnicities present distinct clinical characteristics. The disease imposes a 
significant burden in all health-related quality of life domains, both in 
children and adults, and a substantial economic cost both at individual and 
national levels. The pathophysiology of AD includes a complex and multifaceted 
interplay between the impaired dysfunctional epidermal barrier, genetic 
predisposition, and environmental contributors, such as chemical and/or 
biological pollutants and allergens, in the context of dysregulated TH2 and TH17 
skewed immune response. Regarding the genetic component, the loss of function 
mutations encoding structural proteins such as filaggrin, a fundamental 
epidermal protein, and the more recently identified variations in the epidermal 
differentiation complex are well-established determinants resulting in an 
impaired skin barrier in AD. More recently, epigenetic factors have facilitated 
AD development, including the dysbiotic skin microbiome and the effect of the 
external exposome, combined with dietary disorders. Notably, the interleukin 
(IL)-31 network, comprising several cell types, including macrophages, 
basophils, and the generated cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of itch in 
AD, has recently been explored. Unraveling the specific AD endotypes, 
highlighting the implicated molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of clinically 
relevant AD phenotypes, has emerged as a crucial step toward targeted therapies 
for personalized treatment in AD patients. This review aims to present 
state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the multifactorial and interactive 
pathophysiological mechanisms in AD.

BACKGROUND: The skin microbiota maintains a physical and immunological barrier 
to the environment. Little is known about how the microbiome changes over time 
or the effect of hand hygiene practices and moisturizer use.
OBJECTIVES: To assess sex-specific changes in skin bacteria over time, and how 
the microbiome is related to self-reported hand eczema, hand hygiene practices 
and use of moisturizers.
METHODS: Swab samples from the dorsal hand were collected at baseline and 
6.5 years later during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 168 participants from the 
RHINESSA study in Bergen, Norway. The skin samples were analysed by 16S rRNA 
amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS: The alpha diversity of the hand microbiome increased from baseline to 
follow-up, and beta diversity differed by sex at both time points. The relative 
abundance increased for several bacteria from baseline to follow-up, with 
sex-specific differences. Current hand eczema and aggravating hand eczema during 
the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with an increase in Staphylococcus. High 
hand washing frequency at home was associated with lower alpha diversity and 
with higher abundance of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Finegoldia, and 
Pseudomonas and lower abundance of Propionibacterium and Pelomonas. The alpha 
diversity increased with increasing time passing between hand washing and 
sampling, whereas more frequent moisturizer use was associated with 
significantly lower alpha diversity, and a change in abundance for some 
bacteria, such as more Pseudomonas.
CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study revealed an overall increase in skin 
microbial diversity over a 6-year period, which was unexpected since follow-up 
was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic when vigorous hand hygienic practices 
were introduced. Sex-specific differences were identified at both time points. 
Individuals with hand eczema seem to develop a more dysbiotic skin bacterial 
community over time. Hand washing and use of moisturizers, with typically 
gender-specific habitual patterns, may lead to change in bacterial composition.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with repeated 
exacerbations of eczema and pruritus. Probiotics can prevent or treat AD 
appropriately via modulation of immune responses and gut microbiota. In this 
study, we evaluated effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) KBL409 
using a house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae)-induced in vivo AD model. 
Oral administration of L. acidophilus KBL409 significantly reduced dermatitis 
scores and decreased infiltration of immune cells in skin tissues. L. 
acidophilus KBL409 reduced in serum immunoglobulin E and mRNA levels of T helper 
(Th)1 (Interferon-γ), Th2 (Interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31), and Th17 
(IL-17A) cytokines in skin tissues. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was 
increased and Foxp3 expression was up-regulated in AD-induced mice with L. 
acidophilus KBL409. Furthermore, L. acidophilus KBL409 significantly modulated 
gut microbiota and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and amino acids, 
which could explain its effects on AD. Our results suggest that L. acidophilus 
KBL409 is the potential probiotic for AD treatment by modulating of immune 
responses and gut microbiota of host.

Altered gut microbiome composition has been reported in children with eczema and 
interventions that restore beneficial bacteria in the gut may improve eczema. 
This open-label pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel infant 
microbiome formula (SIM03) in young children with eczema. Pre-school Chinese 
children aged 1-5 years old with eczema received SIM03 twice daily for three 
months. The novelty of SIM03 consists of both the use of a patented 
microencapsulation technology to protect the viability of unique Bifidobacterium 
bifidum and Bifidobacterium breve strains identified through big data analysis 
of large metagenomic datasets of young Chinese children. Paired stool samples at 
baseline and following SIM03 were analyzed by metagenomics sequencing. 
Generalized estimating equation was used to analyze changes in eczema severity, 
skin biophysical parameters, quality of life and stool microbiome. Twenty 
children aged 3.0 ± 1.6 years (10 with severe eczema) were recruited. Treatment 
compliance was ≥ 98%. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis score decreased significantly at 
two months (P = 0.008) and three months (P < 0.001), while quality of life 
improved significantly at 1, 2, and 3 months. The relative abundance of B. breve 
and microbial pathways on acetate and acetyl-CoA synthesis were enriched in 
stool samples at one month (P = 0.0014). Children who demonstrated increased B. 
bifidum after SIM03 showed improvement in sleep loss (P = 0.045). Relative 
abundance of B. breve correlated inversely with eczema extent (P = 0.023) and 
intensity (P = 0.019) only among patients with increased B. breve at Month 3. No 
serious adverse event was observed. In conclusion, SIM03 is well tolerated. This 
patented microbiome formula improves disease severity and quality of life in 
young eczematous children by enhancing the delivery of B. bifidum and B. breve 
in the gut. SIM03 is a potential treatment option for childhood eczema.

Adverse skin reactions caused by the COVID-19 vaccine have attracted 
considerable attention. As we all know, the development mechanism of some skin 
diseases is related to the gut and skin microbiome. A 78-year-old male patient 
who received the COVID-19 vaccine developed generalized eczema with multiple 
dense black patches over the body, a widespread rash, erosion, and scabs on his 
limbs, as well as facial edema. The patient experienced recurrent flare-ups 
after conventional treatment, but then recovered well without recurrence after 
undergoing three fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) treatments. This rare 
case is reported for the first time in this study. This report demonstrates the 
possible potential of FMT in targeting refractory skin diseases, such as eczema, 
as well as diseases associated with gut microbiota disturbance after 
vaccination.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects 
individuals of all age groups, manifesting as a spectrum of symptoms varying 
from mild to severe. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) involves the administration of 
allergen extracts and has emerged as a potential treatment strategy for 
modifying immune responses. Its pathogenesis involves epidermal barrier 
dysfunction, microbiome imbalance, immune dysregulation, and environmental 
factors. Existing treatment strategies encompass topical steroids to systemic 
agents, while AIT is under investigation as a potential immune-modifying 
alternative. Several studies have shown reductions in the severity scoring of 
atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) scores, daily rescue medication use, and visual 
analog scale (VAS) scores following AIT. Biomarker changes include increased 
IgG4 levels and decreased eosinophil counts. This review provides valuable 
insights for future research and clinical practice, exploring AIT as a viable 
option for the management of AD.

The skin microbiome at lesion sites in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is 
characterized by dysbiosis. Although the administration of dupilumab, an IL-4Rα 
inhibitor, improves dysbiosis in the bacterial microbiome, information regarding 
the fungal microbiome remains limited. This study administered dupilumab to 30 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD and analyzed changes in both fungal and 
bacterial skin microbiomes over a 12-week period. Malassezia restricta and M. 
globosa dominated the fungal microbiome, whereas non-Malassezia yeast species 
increased in abundance, leading to greater microbial diversity. A qPCR analysis 
revealed a decrease in Malassezia colonization following administration, with a 
higher reduction rate observed where the pretreatment degree of colonization was 
higher. A correlation was found between the group classified by the Eczema Area 
and Severity Index, the group categorized by the concentration of Thymus and 
activation-regulated chemokine, and the degree of skin colonization by 
Malassezia. Furthermore, an analysis of the bacterial microbiome also confirmed 
a decrease in the degree of skin colonization by the exacerbating factor 
Staphylococcus aureus and an increase in the microbial diversity of the 
bacterial microbiome. Our study is the first to show that dupilumab changes the 
community structure of the bacterial microbiome and affects the fungal 
microbiome in patients with AD.

The fact that genetic and environmental factors could trigger disruption of the 
epithelial barrier and subsequently initiate a TH2 inflammatory cascade 
conversely proposes that protecting the same barrier and promoting adequate 
interactions with other organs, such as the gut, may be crucial for lowering the 
risk and preventing atopic diseases, particularly, food allergies. In this 
review, we provide an overview of structural characteristics that support the 
epithelial barrier hypothesis in patients with atopic dermatitis, including the 
most relevant filaggrin gene mutations, the recent discovery of the role of the 
transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, and the role involvement of the 
microbiome in healthy and damaged skin. We present experimental and human 
studies that support the mechanisms of allergen penetration, particularly the 
dual allergen exposure and the outside-in, inside-out, and 
outside-inside-outside hypotheses. We discuss classic skin-targeted therapies 
for food allergy prevention, including moisturizers, steroids, and topical 
calcineurin inhibitors, along with pioneering trials proposed to change their 
current use (Prevention of Allergy via Cutaneous Intervention and Stopping 
Eczema and ALlergy). We provide an overview of the novel therapies that enhance 
the skin barrier, such as probiotics and prebiotics topical application, 
read-through drugs, direct and indirect FLG replacement, and interleukin and 
janus kinases inhibitors. Last, we discuss the newer strategies for preventing 
and treating food allergies in the form of epicutaneous immunotherapy and the 
experimental use of single-dose of adeno-associated virus vector gene 
immunotherapy.

Free fatty acid 3 receptor (FFA3; previously GPR41) is a G protein-coupled 
receptor that senses short-chain fatty acids and dietary metabolites produced by 
the gut microbiota. FFA3 deficiency reportedly exacerbates inflammatory events 
in asthma. Herein, we aimed to determine the therapeutic potential of FFA3 
agonists in treating inflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of 
N-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-4-(furan-2-yl)-2-methyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline-3-carboxamide 
(AR420626), an FFA3 agonist, in in vivo models of chemically induced allergic 
asthma and eczema in BALB/c mice. Administration of AR420626 decreased the 
number of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and skin. AR420626 
suppressed inflammatory cytokine expression in the lung and skin tissues. 
Histological examination revealed that AR420626 suppressed inflammation in the 
lungs and skin. Treatment with AR420626 significantly suppressed the enhanced 
lymph node size and inflammatory cytokine levels. Overall, FFA3 agonist AR420626 
could suppress allergic asthma and eczema, implying that activation of FFA3 
might be a therapeutic target for allergic diseases.

The role of the skin-gut axis in atopic dermatitis (AD) remains a subject of 
debate, limiting non-pharmacological interventions such as probiotics and 
prebiotics. To improve understanding of their potential as a monotherapy for 
stable mild cases, we conducted a real-life, multicenter, retrospective 
observational study in Italy. We administered three selected bacteria 
(Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BS01, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 
LP14, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR05) orally to patients with mild atopic 
dermatitis without a placebo control group, following up for 12 weeks. Clinical 
assessments using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Eczema Area and 
Severity Index (EASI), and Three-Item Severity (TIS) score were conducted on 144 
enrolled patients (average age: 25.1 ± 17.6 years). Notably, both pruritus and 
AD-related lesions (erythema, edema/papules, excoriation) exhibited significant 
clinical and statistical improvement (p < 0.001) after 12 weeks of exclusive 
probiotic and prebiotic use. These preliminary results suggest a potential link 
between the skin-gut microbiome and support the rationale for using specific 
probiotics and prebiotics in mild AD, even for maintenance, to reduce flares and 
dysbiosis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease 
characterized by itching. The gut microbiome can help maintain skin immune 
homeostasis by regulating innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we report a case 
of AD in a 15-year-old adolescent boy who benefited from washed microbiota 
transplantation (WMT). WMT was performed for three courses, with each course 
lasting for three consecutive days and an interval of one month between two 
courses. Clinical assessments were conducted at each WMT course, and skin, 
blood, and stool samples were collected for microbial analysis. After three 
months of WMT treatment, the boy's itchiness was effectively controlled: his 
skin showed noticeable improvement, with reduced Staphylococcus aureus in the 
skin lesions. The scores of SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), EASI (Eczema 
Area and Severity Index), NRS (Numerical Rating Scale), and DLQI (Dermatology 
Life Quality Index) significantly decreased compared to the baseline. Serum 
levels of eosinophil ratio, tumor necrotic factor-α, and interleukin-6 also 
reduced to the normal levels. There was a significant decrease in S. aureus in 
the skin lesions. Additionally, the intestinal flora became more diverse, and 
the abundance of Bifidobacterium species, significantly increased after WMT. No 
adverse events were reported during the treatment and the 1-year follow-up 
period. This case report provides direct clinical evidence for WMT as a novel 
promising treatment strategy for AD, and preliminary experimental data suggests 
the existence of an intestinal-skin axis in terms of the gut microbiota and the 
skin immune homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory disease of the skin 
that begins early in life and can be lifelong. The purpose of our study was to 
evaluate whether fetal exposure and/or early-life exposure of a child to 
antibiotics increases the risk of early-onset AD.
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that antibiotic exposure in utero or early in life 
(e.g. first 90 days) increases the likelihood that children develop AD.
METHODS: Utilizing a large, prospectively collected electronic medical records 
database, we studied the association of antibiotic exposure received in utero or 
very early in life and the relative risk of onset of AD in a population-based 
cohort study. Associations were estimated using proportional hazards models as 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: The risk of AD in childhood was increased after in utero or early-life 
antibiotic exposure. For any in utero antibiotic exposure the HR (CI) was 1.38 
(1.36-1.39). However, penicillin demonstrated the strongest association with AD 
for both in utero exposure [1.43 (1.41-1.44)] and for childhood exposure [1.81 
(1.79-1.82)]. HRs were higher in children born to mothers without AD than in 
those with AD pointing to effect modification by maternal AD status.
CONCLUSIONS: Children born to mothers exposed to antibiotics while in utero had, 
depending on the mother's history of AD, approximately a 20-40% increased risk 
of developing AD. Depending on the antibiotic, children who received antibiotics 
early in life had a 40-80% increased risk of developing AD. Our study supports 
and refines the association between incident AD and antibiotic administration. 
It also adds population-based support to therapeutic attempts to treat AD by 
modifying the skin microbiome.

Emerging research underscores the substantial link between gut flora and various 
inflammatory skin diseases. We hypothesize that there exists a complex gut-skin 
axis, possibly affecting the progression of conditions such as eczema, acne, 
psoriasis, and rosacea. However, the precise nature of the causal connection 
between gut flora and skin diseases remains unestablished. In this study, we 
started by compiling summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
featuring 211 unique gut microbiota and four types of skin conditions. We 
scrutinized these data across different taxonomic strata. Subsequently, we 
leveraged Mendelian randomization (MR) to ascertain if there is a causal link 
between gut microbiota and these skin conditions. We also performed a 
bidirectional MR analysis to identify the causality's direction. By utilizing 
Mendelian randomization, we identified 26 causal connections between the gut 
microbiome and four recognized inflammatory skin conditions, including 9 
positive and 17 negative causal directions. Additional sensitivity analyses of 
these results revealed no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Our MR 
analysis suggests a causal connection between gut microbiota and skin diseases, 
potentially providing groundbreaking perspectives for future mechanistic and 
clinical studies on microbiota-affected skin conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Rural children have a lower risk of asthma and atopic diseases 
than urban children. However, whether indoor microbiota in non-farming rural 
homes provides protection is unclear.
METHODS: Here, we examine if microbes in the beds of rural and urban infants are 
associated with later development of atopic diseases. We studied fungi and 
bacteria in the beds of 6-month-old infants (n = 514) in association with the 
risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and aeroallergen sensitization at 
6 years of age in the prospective COPSAC2010 cohort.
RESULTS: Both fungal and bacterial diversity were lower in the beds of children, 
who later developed allergic rhinitis (-0.22 [-0.43,-0.01], padj  = .04 and -.24 
[-0.42,-0.05], padj  = .01 respectively) and lower bacterial richness was 
discovered in beds of children later developing asthma (-41.34 [-76.95,-5.73], 
padj  = .02) or allergic rhinitis (-45.65 [-81.19,-10.10], padj  = .01). 
Interestingly, higher fungal diversity and richness were discovered in the beds 
of children developing eczema (0.23 [0.02,0.43], padj  = .03 and 29.21 
[1.59,56.83], padj  = .04 respectively). We defined a limited set of fungal and 
bacterial genera that predicted rural/urban environment. Some rural-associated 
bacterial genera such as Romboutsia and Bacillus and fungal genera Spegazzinia 
and Physcia were also associated with reduced risk of diseases, including 
eczema. These fungal and bacterial fingerprints predicting the living 
environment were associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, but not eczema, 
with rural compositions being protective. The bed dust bacteria mediated 27% of 
the protective association of a rural living environment for allergic rhinitis 
(p = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Bed dust microbes can be differentially associated with airway- and 
skin-related diseases. The differing bed dust microbiota between rural and urban 
infants may influence their later risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis.

BACKGROUND: Systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) are evaluated 
primarily in placebo-controlled trials with binary efficacy outcomes. In a 
living systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA), we previously analysed 
continuous efficacy measures.
OBJECTIVES: To compare binary efficacy outcomes of systemic treatments for AD.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science 
Information (LILACS) database, Global Resource for Eczema Trials (GREAT) 
database and trial registries up to 1 March 2023. We included randomized trials 
examining ≥ 8 weeks of treatment with systemic immunomodulatory medications for 
moderate-to-severe AD. We screened titles, abstracts and full texts and 
abstracted data independently, in duplicate. Outcomes included the proportion of 
patients achieving at least 50%, 75% and 90% improvements in Eczema Area and 
Severity Index (EASI 50, EASI 75 and EASI 90, respectively) and Investigator 
Global Assessment (IGA) success. We performed random-effects Bayesian NMAs to 
calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) between each 
intervention for each outcome.
RESULTS: Eighty-three trials with 22 122 participants were included in the 
systematic review. In analyses limited to trials of 8-16 weeks' duration with 
predominantly adult populations, abrocitinib 200 mg daily (OR 1.5, 95% CrI 
1.1-2.2) and upadacitinib 15 mg daily (OR 1.7, 95% CrI 0.9-3.3) and 30 mg daily 
(OR 2.5, 95% CrI 1.3-5.0) were associated with higher odds of achieving EASI 50 
vs. dupilumab. Abrocitinib 100 mg daily (OR 0.7, 95% CrI 0.5-1.0), baricitinib 
2 mg daily (OR 0.4, 95% CrI 0.3-0.5) and 4 mg daily (OR 0.5, 95% CrI 0.3-0.7), 
and tralokinumab (OR 0.4, 95% CrI 0.3-0.6) were associated with lower odds of 
achieving EASI 50 vs. dupilumab. Results were similar for EASI 75, EASI 90 and 
IGA success.
CONCLUSIONS: Supporting results for continuous outcome measures, upadacitinib 
30 mg daily and abrocitinib 200 mg daily are the most efficacious with regard to 
binary efficacy endpoints up to 16 weeks in adults with moderate-to-severe AD, 
followed by upadacitinib 15 mg daily, dupilumab and abrocitinib 100 mg daily. 
Dupilumab and both doses of upadacitinib and abrocitinib are more efficacious 
than baricitinib 4 and 2 mg daily and tralokinumab.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) endotypes differ with ethnicity. We examined 
the skin microbiota, cytokine and lipid profiles in Greenlandic Inuit and Danish 
children with AD.
METHODS: Twenty-five Inuit children with AD and 25 Inuit control children were 
clinically examined and compared to previously collected data from 25 Danish 
children with AD. Skin tape strips and skin swabs were collected from lesional 
and non-lesional skin. Levels of cutaneous immune biomarkers, free sphingoid 
bases and their (glycosyl)ceramides were analysed. Skin swabs were analysed with 
16S rRNA and tuf gene for characterization of bacterial species communities.
RESULTS: Bacterial β-diversity was significantly different between Inuit and 
Danish AD skin, in both lesional (p < 0.001) and non-lesional (p < 0.001) AD 
skin, and there was a higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus in 
Danish compared to Inuit lesional (53% vs. 8%, p < 0.01) and non-lesional skin 
(55% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). Danish AD children had a higher α-diversity than Inuit 
children in non-lesional (p < 0.05) but not in lesional skin. Significantly 
higher levels of type 2 immunity cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 (p < 0.05) and IL-5 
(p < 0.01) were identified in Inuit compared to Danish AD children. In contrast, 
IL-33 (p < 0.01) was higher in Danish lesional and non-lesional AD skin. Higher 
levels of long-chain glucosylceramide (GlcCER)[S](d26:1) were found in lesional 
(p < 0.001) and non-lesional (p < 0.001) Inuit skin compared with Danish AD 
skin. NMF levels were similar in Inuit and Danish AD skin.
CONCLUSION: Skin microbiota, cytokine and lipid composition differed 
significantly between Inuit and Danish children with AD and showed a stronger 
type 2 immune signature in Inuit children.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with a 
significant association with various type-2 inflammation-related comorbidities. 
Ongoing research suggests the crucial involvement of gut microbiome, especially 
in childhood onset AD, and hence, probiotics have emerged as a potential 
non-steroid-based therapeutics option to complement existing AD management 
plans. In order to delineate the impact of probiotics in the gut microbiome of 
pediatric AD patients from southern China, targeted 16S rRNA sequencing and 
thorough bioinformatic analysis were performed to analyze the gut microbiome 
profiles of 24 AD children after taking an orally administered novel synbiotics 
formula with triple prebiotics for 8 weeks. A notable improvement in Eczema Area 
and Severity Index (EASI) (p = 0.008) was observed after taking an 8-week course 
of probiotics, with no adverse effects observed. The relative abundances of key 
microbial drivers including Bacteroides fragilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus 
were significantly increased at week 8. We also found that the positive 
responsiveness towards an 8-week course of probiotics was associated with 
improvements in the gut microbiome profile with a higher relative abundance of 
probiotic species. Over-represented functional abundance pathways related to 
vitamin B synthesis and peptidoglycan recycling may imply the underlying 
mechanism. In summary, our study suggests how the gut microbial landscape shifts 
upon probiotic supplementation in AD children, and provides preliminary evidence 
to support targeted probiotic supplementation for the management of childhood 
AD.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic and recurring inflammatory skin 
disorder characterized by an intensely pruritic, eczematous dermatitis. The 
etiology of AD is thought to involve a combination of environmental, genetic, 
and immunologic factors. Emerging research has investigated factors that may 
impact individual risk for developing AD, disease severity, and treatment 
response. One component is the gut microbiome, which is considered to play an 
essential role in maintaining the homeostasis of several organ systems. The gut 
microbiome has been described as a major regulator of the "gut-skin axis," yet 
some studies have yielded conflicting evidence regarding the strength of the 
association of gut microbiota dysbiosis with AD. This review discusses recent 
insights into the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and its 
interplay among other complex systems that govern the current assessments of and 
treatments for AD.

BACKGROUND: A rapid expansion of systemic immunological treatment options for 
atopic dermatitis (AD) has created a need for clinically relevant and 
understandable comparative efficacy and safety information for patients and 
clinicians. Given the scarcity of head-to-head trials, network meta-analysis 
(NMA) is an alternative way to enable robust comparisons among treatment 
options; however, NMA results are often complex and difficult to directly 
implement in shared decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a website that effectively 
presents the results of a living systematic review and NMA on AD treatments to 
patient and clinician users.
METHODS: We conducted a multimethod study using iterative feedback from adults 
with AD, adult caregivers of children with AD, dermatologists, and allergists 
within a user-centered design framework. We used questionnaires followed by 
workshops among patients and clinicians to develop and improve the website 
interface. Usability testing was done with a caregiver of a patient with eczema.
RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 31 adults with AD or caregivers and 94 
clinicians. Patients and caregivers felt it was very important to know about new 
treatments (20/31, 65%). Clinicians felt the lack of evidence-based comparisons 
between treatments was a barrier to care (55/93, 59%). "Avoiding dangerous side 
effects" was ranked as the most important priority for patients (weighted 
ranking 5.2/7, with higher ranking being more important), and "improving 
patients' overall symptoms" was the most important priority for clinicians 
(weighted ranking 5.0/6). A total of 4 patients and 7 clinicians participated in 
workshops; they appreciated visualizations of the NMA results and found the 
website valuable for comparing different treatments. The patients suggested 
changes to simplify the interface and clarify terminology related to comparative 
efficacy. The user in the usability testing found the website intuitive to 
navigate.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a website, "eczematherapies.com," with a user-centered 
design approach. Visualizations of NMA results enable users to compare 
treatments as part of their shared decision-making process.

Bioprospecting is the discovery and exploration of biological diversity found 
within organisms, genetic elements or produced compounds with prospective 
commercial or therapeutic applications. The human skin is an ecological niche 
which harbours a rich and compositional diversity microbiome stemming from the 
multifactorial interactions between the host and microbiota facilitated by 
exploitable effector compounds. Advances in the understanding of microbial 
colonisation mechanisms alongside species and strain interactions have revealed 
a novel chemical and biological understanding which displays applicative 
potential. Studies elucidating the organismal interfaces and concomitant 
understanding of the central processes of skin biology have begun to unravel a 
potential wealth of molecules which can exploited for their proposed functions. 
A variety of skin-microbiome-derived compounds display prospective therapeutic 
applications, ranging from antioncogenic agents relevant in skin cancer therapy 
to treatment strategies for antimicrobial-resistant bacterial and fungal 
infections. Considerable opportunities have emerged for the translation to 
personal care products, such as topical agents to mitigate various skin 
conditions such as acne and eczema. Adjacent compound developments have focused 
on cosmetic applications such as reducing skin ageing and its associated changes 
to skin properties and the microbiome. The skin microbiome contains a wealth of 
prospective compounds with therapeutic and commercial applications; however, 
considerable work is required for the translation of in vitro findings to 
relevant in vivo models to ensure translatability.

Regulatory T Cell-Targeted Immunomodulatory Therapy for Long-Term Clinical 
Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis: Hypotheses and Perspectives.

Medicine, Suwon 16499, Republic of Korea.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disorder 
characterized by itching and eczematous lesions. It is often associated with a 
personal or familial history of allergic diseases. Allergic inflammation induced 
by immunoglobulin E and T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell responses to common 
environmental agents has been suggested to play an essential role in AD 
pathogenesis. The standard therapies for AD, including topical or systemic 
agents, focus on controlling skin inflammation. Recently developed monoclonal 
antibody to interleukin-4 receptor alpha or Janus kinase inhibitors can provide 
significant clinical improvements in patients with AD by inhibiting Th2 
cell-mediated skin inflammation. However, the clinical efficacy of the Th2 
cell-targeted therapy is transient and incomplete in patients with AD. Patients 
with AD are seeking a permanent cure. Therefore, the development of novel 
immunomodulatory strategies that can improve a long-term clinical outcome and 
provide a long-term treatment-free clinical remission of AD (disease-modifying 
therapy) is needed. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in the 
maintenance of immune tolerance and suppress the development of autoimmune and 
allergic diseases. This review provides three working hypotheses and 
perspectives for the treatment of AD by Treg cell activation. (1) A decreased 
number or function of Treg cells is a critical event that causes the activation 
of Th2 cells, leading to the development and maintenance of AD. (2) Activation 
of Treg cells is an effective therapeutic approach for AD. (3) Many different 
immunomodulatory strategies activating Treg cells can provide a long-term 
clinical improvement of AD by induction of immune tolerance. The Treg 
cell-targeted immunomodulatory therapies for AD include allergen immunotherapy, 
microbiota, vitamin D, polyvalent human immunoglobulin G, monoclonal antibodies 
to the surface antigens of T cell or antigen-presenting cell, and adoptive 
transfer of autologous Treg cells or genetically engineered Treg cells expanded 
in vitro.

Imbalance of the immune system caused by alterations of the gut microbiome is 
considered to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of infant eczema, but the 
exact role of the gut microbiome in adult atopic dermatitis (AD) patients 
remains to be clarified. To investigate the differences of the gut microbiome 
between adult AD patients and healthy individuals, stool samples of 234 adults, 
containing 104 AD patients and 130 healthy subjects, were collected for 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon. Altered structure and metabolic dysfunctions of the gut 
microbiome were identified in adult AD patients. Our results illustrated that 
the adult AD patients were more likely to have allergies, particularly non-food 
allergies. In addition, the gut microbiome composition of the AD and normal 
groups were considerably different. Moreover, Romboutsia and 
Clostridi-um_sensu_stricto_1 was enriched in the normal group, whereas Blautia, 
Butyricicoccus, Lachnoclostridium, Eubacterium_hallii_group, 
Erysi-pelatoclostridium, Megasphaera, Oscillibacter, and Flavonifractor 
dominated in the AD group. Additionally, purine nucleotide degradation pathways 
were significantly enriched in the AD group, and the enrichment of proteinogenic 
amino acid biosynthesis pathways was found in the normal group. This study 
provides insights into new therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome 
for AD and evidence for the involvement of the gut-skin axis in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic, relapsing, and remitting 
inflammatory skin disorder associated with cutaneous dysbiosis. Current 
treatment options often fail to adequately control the disease and have 
unfavorable safety profiles. There is a need for new options that address these 
treatment shortcomings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of FB-401, a live therapeutic product of 3 strains of Roseomonas 
mucosa, compared to matching placebo applied topically 3 times per week to 
participants ages ≥2 years of age with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
was conducted. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with 50% 
improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index score from baseline at week 16. 
154 subjects aged 2 or older with a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis as 
defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria with mild or moderate severity were 
randomized 1:1 via interactive web response system to FB-401 or placebo.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects who achieved the primary outcome was similar 
between both treatment groups, with no significant treatment group differences 
observed at any post-baseline visit. The number of treatment-emergent adverse 
events and the number of subjects with at least one were similar across 
treatment groups. One serious adverse event not related to treatment was 
reported. No treatment-emergent adverse events led to treatment discontinuation 
or study discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: FB-401 showed an acceptable safety profile but failed to prove 
superior to placebo in treating children and adults with mild-to-moderate atopic 
dermatitis.

Atopic dermatitis represents a complex and multidimensional interaction that 
represents potential fields of preventive and therapeutic management. In 
addition to the treatment armamentarium available for atopic dermatitis, novel 
drugs targeting significant molecular pathways in atopic dermatitis biologics 
and small molecules are also being developed given the condition's complex 
pathophysiology. While most of the patients are expecting better efficacy and 
long-term control, the response to these drugs would still depend on numerous 
factors such as complex genotype, diverse environmental triggers and 
microbiome-derived signals, and, most importantly, dynamic immune responses. 
This review article highlights the challenges and the recently developed 
pharmacological agents in atopic dermatitis based on the molecular pathogenesis 
of this condition, creating a specific therapeutic approach toward a more 
personalized medicine.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects diverse ethnic groups with significant 
disparities in prevalence, disease progression, clinical outcomes, and access to 
care. There are limited data on AD in the Arabic population of the Middle East, 
yet there is a substantial economic and psychosocial burden of AD in this region 
with a large unmet need with regards to disease management that is critical to 
address. There is a trend of increasing prevalence of AD in the Arab Middle 
East; however, due to the large environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural 
heterogeneity of this region, prevalence varies greatly across and within 
countries. Similarly, clinical differences in disease presentations exist across 
the region, although data are limited. In this review, we will present clinical 
phenotypes of AD common in different regions of the Arab Middle East, and data 
on prevalence, genetic variations, and challenges of treatment. Further studies 
exploring molecular biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms, immune factors, and the 
microbiome of patients in the region will help to elucidate the mechanism behind 
ethnic differences in AD in this population as well as to understand 
susceptibilities and treatment response.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory, intensely pruritic skin 
disorder associated with significant patient burden. Interleukin (IL)-13 is a 
cytokine that acts as a driver of immune dysregulation, skin-barrier 
dysfunction, and microbiome dysbiosis that characterizes AD, and is consistently 
overexpressed in AD skin. Tralokinumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to IL-13 with high affinity, thereby 
inhibiting subsequent downstream IL-13 signaling. Three pivotal phase 3 clinical 
trials demonstrated that tralokinumab 300 mg every other week, as monotherapy or 
in combination with topical corticosteroids as needed, provides significant 
improvements in signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe AD, as measured by 
Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 (clear/almost clear) and Eczema Area and 
Severity Index-75 at Week 16. Improvements were observed soon after tralokinumab 
initiation and were maintained over 52 weeks of therapy. Tralokinumab 
significantly improved patient-reported outcomes such as itch and sleep, and 
demonstrated a safety profile comparable with placebo; conjunctivitis during 
tralokinumab therapy was generally mild. Similar results were observed in a 
phase 3 adolescent trial. The role of IL-13 in the pathophysiology of AD 
justifies a targeted approach and a wealth of clinical data supports 
tralokinumab as a new therapeutic option for people with moderate-to-severe AD.

BACKGROUND: While the microbiome is increasingly seen as a targetable 
contributor to atopic dermatitis (AD), questions remain as to whether the 
dysbiosis is secondary to diseased skin or if it predates symptom onset. 
Previous work has evaluated how the skin microbiome changes with age and 
established the influence of factors like delivery mode and breastfeeding on 
global microbiome diversity. However, these studies were unable to identify taxa 
which predict subsequent AD.
METHODS: Skin swab samples were collected from the first week of life for 72 
children in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a single site hospital. 
Participants were followed for 3 years to determine their health status. We 
applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing to assess the microbiome differences 
between 31 children who went on to develop AD and 41 controls.
RESULTS: We identified that subsequent development of AD was associated with 
differential abundance of several bacterial and fungal taxa as well as several 
metabolic pathways, each of which have been previously associated with active 
AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides evidence of reproducibility for the previously 
reported dysbiotic signatures predating AD onset while also expanding prior 
findings through the first use of metagenomic assessment prior to AD onset. 
While extrapolation of our findings beyond the pre-term, NICU cohort is limited, 
our findings add to the evidence that the dysbiosis associated with AD pre-dates 
disease onset rather than reflect a secondary consequence of skin inflammation.

The skin microbiota is a pivotal contributor to the maintenance of skin 
homeostasis by protecting it from harmful pathogens and regulating the immune 
system. An imbalance in the skin microbiota can lead to pathological conditions 
such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne. The balance of the skin microbiota 
components can be disrupted by different elements and dynamics such as changes 
in pH levels, exposure to environmental toxins, and the use of certain skincare 
products. Some research suggests that certain probiotic strains and their 
metabolites (postbiotics) may provide benefits such as improving the skin 
barrier function, reducing inflammation, and improving the appearance of 
acne-prone or eczema-prone skin. Consequently, in recent years probiotics and 
postbiotics have become a popular ingredient in skincare products. Moreover, it 
was demonstrated that skin health can be influenced by the skin-gut axis, and 
imbalances in the gut microbiome caused by poor diet, stress, or the use of 
antibiotics can lead to skin conditions. In this way, products that improve gut 
microbiota balance have been gaining attention from cosmetic and pharmaceutical 
companies. The present review will focus on the crosstalk between the SM and the 
host, and its effects on health and diseases.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema is an increasingly manifested 
inflammatory skin disorder of complex etiology which is modulated by both 
extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The exposome includes a person's lifetime 
exposures and their effects. We recently reviewed the extrinsic exposome's 
environmental risk factors that contribute to AD. The periods of pregnancy, 
infancy, and teenage years are recognized as crucial stages in the formation of 
AD, where the exposome leads to enduring impacts on the immune system. However, 
research is now focusing on the interactions between intrinsic pathways that are 
modulated by the extrinsic exposome, including genetic variation, epigenetic 
modifications, and signals, such as diet, stress, and microbiome interactions. 
As a result, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction, hormonal fluctuations, 
and skin microbiome dysbiosis are important factors contributing to AD 
development, and their in-depth understanding is crucial not only for AD 
treatment but also for similar inflammatory disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder 
with limited treatment options for adolescents with moderate-to-severe disease. 
Lebrikizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-13, demonstrated 
clinical benefit in previous Phase 3 trials: ADvocate1 (NCT04146363), ADvocate2 
(NCT04178967), and ADhere (NCT04250337). We report 52-week safety and efficacy 
outcomes from ADore (NCT04250350), a Phase 3, open-label study of lebrikizumab 
in adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The primary endpoint was to 
describe the proportion of patients who discontinued from study treatment 
because of adverse events (AEs) through the last treatment visit.
METHODS: Adolescent patients (N = 206) (≥ 12 to < 18 years old, 
weighing ≥ 40 kg) with moderate-to-severe AD received subcutaneous lebrikizumab 
500 mg loading doses at baseline and Week 2, followed by 250 mg every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) thereafter. Safety was monitored using reported AEs, AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation, vital signs, growth assessments, and laboratory 
testing. Efficacy analyses included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), 
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), Body Surface Area (BSA), (Children's) 
Dermatology Life Quality Index ((C)DLQI), and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety, and PROMIS Depression.
RESULTS: 172 patients completed the treatment period. Low frequencies of SAEs 
(n = 5, 2.4%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (n = 5, 2.4%) were 
reported. Overall, 134 patients (65%) reported at least one treatment-emergent 
AE (TEAE), most being mild or moderate in severity. In total, 62.6% achieved IGA 
(0,1) with ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline and 81.9% achieved EASI-75 by 
Week 52. The EASI mean percentage improvement from baseline to Week 52 was 
86.0%. Mean BSA at baseline was 45.4%, decreasing to 8.4% by Week 52. 
Improvements in mean change from baseline (CFB) to Week 52 were observed in DLQI 
(baseline 12.3; CFB - 8.9), CDLQI (baseline 10.1; CFB - 6.5), PROMIS Anxiety 
(baseline 51.5; CFB - 6.3), and PROMIS Depression (baseline 49.3; CFB - 3.4) 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W had a safety profile consistent with 
previous trials and significantly improved AD symptoms and quality of life, with 
meaningful responses at Week 16 increasing by Week 52.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04250350.

Plain Language Summary: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory 
skin disease that affects up to 15% of adolescents worldwide, with up to 50% 
suffering from moderate-to-severe disease. Signs and symptoms include dry, 
cracked skin; redness; itching; and painful lesions, which can negatively affect 
quality of life and lead to complications, including skin infections. 
Adolescents also report increased rates of anxiety and stress. Lebrikizumab is a 
novel monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to 
interleukin (IL)-13, the key cytokine in atopic dermatitis, blocking the 
downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. Lebrikizumab has been shown 
previously to improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis, including itch, skin 
clearance, and quality of life in ADvocate1, ADvocate2 and ADhere. The ADore 
study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adolescents 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Investigators recruited patients ≥ 12 
to < 18 years old, weighing ≥ 40 kg, from Australia, Canada, Poland, and the US 
who were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. These patients 
received a loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at Weeks 0 and 2, followed by 
250 mg every 2 weeks for 52 weeks. The safety profile of lebrikizumab was 
consistent with previously published reports, with mostly mild or moderate 
adverse events, which did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Lebrikizumab 
improved skin clearance; 62.6% of patients had clear or almost clear skin by the 
end of the trial. Lebrikizumab also improved the patients’ quality of life. 
These safety and efficacy results support lebrikizumab’s role in treating 
adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Safety and Efficacy of

Probiotics are living microorganisms that are present in cultured milk and 
fermented food. Fermented foods are a rich source for the isolation of 
probiotics. They are known as good bacteria. They have various beneficial 
effects on human health including antihypertensive effects, 
antihypercholesterolemic effects, prevention of bowel disease, and improving the 
immune system. Microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, and mold are used as 
probiotics but the major microorganisms that are used as probiotics are bacteria 
from the genus Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium. 
Probiotics are beneficial in the prevention of harmful effects. Recently, the 
use of probiotics for the treatment of various oral and skin diseases has also 
gained significant attention. Clinical studies indicate that the usage of 
probiotics can alter gut microbiota composition and provoke immune modulation in 
a host. Due to their various health benefits, probiotics are attaining more 
interest as a substitute for antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs leading to 
the growth of the probiotic market.

Eczema is a common inflammatory skin disorder during infancy. Evidence has shown 
that skin-microbiome fluctuations may precede eczema development, but their 
predictive value for eczema phenotypes remains unknown. We aimed to investigate 
the early-life evolution of the skin microbiome and its temporal associations 
with different pairs of eczema phenotypes (transient versus persistent, atopic 
versus non-atopic) in Chinese children. We followed 119 term Chinese infants 
from birth to 24 months old within a Hong Kong birth cohort. The skin microbes 
at the left antecubital fossa were serially sampled by flocked swabs at 1, 6, 
and 12 months for bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The atopic sensitization 
at 12 months was strongly associated with eczema persisting to 24 months (odds 
ratio 4.95, 95% confidence interval 1.29-19.01). Compared with those with 
non-atopic eczema, the children with atopic eczema had reduced alpha diversity 
at 12 months (p < 0.001) and transiently higher abundance of the genus 
Janibacter at 6 months (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that atopic 
sensitization at 12 months may predict persistent eczema by 24 months, and 
atopic eczema at 12 months is associated with unique skin microbiome profiles at 
6 and 12 months. Non-invasive skin-microbiome profiling may have predictive 
value for atopic eczema.

Malassezia are the dominant commensal yeast species of the human skin microbiota 
and are associated with inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic eczema (AE). 
The Mala s 1 allergen of Malassezia sympodialis is a β-propeller protein, 
inducing both IgE and T-cell reactivity in AE patients. We demonstrate by 
immuno-electron microscopy that Mala s 1 is mainly located in the M. sympodialis 
yeast cell wall. An anti-Mala s 1 antibody did not inhibit M. sympodialis growth 
suggesting Mala s 1 may not be an antifungal target. In silico analysis of the 
predicted Mala s 1 protein sequence identified a motif indicative of a KELCH 
protein, a subgroup of β-propeller proteins. To test the hypothesis that 
antibodies against Mala s 1 cross-react with human skin (KELCH) proteins we 
examined the binding of the anti-Mala s 1 antibody to human skin explants and 
visualized binding in the epidermal skin layer. Putative human targets 
recognized by the anti-Mala s 1 antibody were identified by immunoblotting and 
proteomics. We propose that Mala s 1 is a KELCH-like β-propeller protein with 
similarity to human skin proteins. Mala s 1 recognition may trigger 
cross-reactive responses that contribute to skin diseases associated with M. 
sympodialis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common but also 
complex chronic, itchy skin condition with underlying inflammation of the skin. 
This skin ailment is prevalent worldwide and affects people of all ages, 
particularly children below five years of age. The itching and resulting rashes 
in AD patients are often the result of inflammatory signals, thus necessitating 
a closer look at the inflammation-regulating mechanisms for putative relief, 
care and therapy. Several chemical- as well as genetically-induced animal models 
have established the importance of targeting pro-inflammatory AD 
microenvironment. Epigenetic mechanisms are gaining attention towards a better 
understanding of the onset as well as the progression of inflammation. Several 
physiological processes with implications in pathophysiology of AD, such as, 
barrier dysfunction either due to reduced filaggrin / human β-defensins or 
altered microbiome, reprograming of Fc receptors with resulting overexpression 
of high affinity IgE receptors, elevated eosinophil numbers or the elevated 
IL-22 production by CD4 + T cells have underlying epigenetic mechanisms that 
include differential promoter methylation and/or regulation by non-coding RNAs. 
Reversing these epigenetic changes has been verified to reduce inflammatory 
burden through altered secretion of cytokines IL-6, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22 
etc, with benefit against AD progression in experimental models. A thorough 
understanding of epigenetic remodeling of inflammation in AD has the potential 
of opening avenues for novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: Emollients are the baseline treatment for mild or moderate atopic 
dermatitis (AD) to improve the epidermal barrier and provide anti-irritant and 
anti-pruritic effects. Emollient 'plus' can influence the skin microbiome of 
atopic eczema patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of using Emollient 'plus' to reduce 
corticosteroid consumption.
METHODS: In an open, single-centre, randomized, controlled study, patients with 
mild to moderate AD (Severity scoring of AD [SCORAD] score 20-30) were 
randomized 1:1 to apply the Emollient 'plus' twice daily for 28 days or to 
continue with their usual classical emollient (Control group). In addition, each 
patient received topical corticosteroids to use when necessary and according to 
the dermatologist's prescription. Assessments included SCORAD, PO-SCORAD, local 
SCORAD, quality of life questionnaires, and tolerability.
RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were included in the PP population with a mean 
age of 26.50 ± 17.5 years old (min-max 3-71 years). Between baseline and day 28, 
the mean amount of corticosteroid used was lower for the Emollient 'plus' versus 
Control group (6.03 vs. 9.16 g; p = 0.041) and corticosteroid was applied on 
fewer days (37.5% vs. 46.9% of days; p = 0.0256) with fewer applications per day 
(0.55 vs. 0.71 applications per day; p = 0.0203). Similar improvements were 
observed in both groups for SCORAD, PO-SCORAD, local SCORAD, skin sensation 
score, AD burden scale, patient benefit index >1, as well as subject and 
investigator efficacy and tolerability questionnaire assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: Between baseline and day 28, there was significant 
corticosteroid-sparing in the Emollient 'plus' group compared to the Control 
group in quantity, number of applications per day and number of days of use, 
whilst efficacy was maintained with no significant differences between the two 
groups for all clinical evaluations, as well as for tolerability.

The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes the 
inflamed skin of people with atopic dermatitis (AD) and worsens disease severity 
by promoting skin damage. Here, we show, by longitudinally tracking 23 children 
treated for AD, that S. aureus adapts via de novo mutations during colonization. 
Each patient's S. aureus population is dominated by a single lineage, with 
infrequent invasion by distant lineages. Mutations emerge within each lineage at 
rates similar to those of S. aureus in other contexts. Some variants spread 
across the body within months, with signatures of adaptive evolution. Most 
strikingly, mutations in capsule synthesis gene capD underwent parallel 
evolution in one patient and across-body sweeps in two patients. We confirm that 
capD negativity is more common in AD than in other contexts, via reanalysis of 
S. aureus genomes from 276 people. Together, these findings highlight the 
importance of the mutation level when dissecting the role of microbes in complex 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) patients display an altered skin microbiome 
which may not only be an indicator but also a driver of inflammation. We aimed 
to investigate associations among AD patients' skin microbiome, clinical data, 
and response to systemic therapy in patients of the TREATgermany registry.
METHODS: Skin swabs of 157 patients were profiled with 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing before and after 3 months of treatment with dupilumab or 
cyclosporine. For comparison, 16s microbiome data from 258 population-based 
healthy controls were used. Disease severity was assessed using established 
instruments such as the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).
RESULTS: We confirmed the previously shown correlation of Staphylococcus aureus 
abundance and bacterial alpha diversity with AD severity as measured by EASI. 
Therapy with Dupilumab shifted the bacterial community toward the pattern seen 
in healthy controls. The relative abundance of Staphylococci and in particular 
S. aureus significantly decreased on both lesional and non-lesional skin, 
whereas the abundance of Staphylococcus hominis increased. These changes were 
largely independent from the degree of clinical improvement and were not 
observed for cyclosporine.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic treatment with dupilumab but not cyclosporine tends to 
restore a healthy skin microbiome largely independent of the clinical response 
indicating potential effects of IL-4RA blockade on the microbiome.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder 
characterized by pruritus and eczema lesions and psychiatric comorbidities. The 
gut-brain-skin axis plays a pivotal role during AD development, which might 
suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. The present study aims to uncover 
the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of fructo-oligofructose (FOS), 
a type of prebiotic, on AD-like skin manifestations and comorbid anxiety and 
depression in AD mice.
RESULTS: Female Kunming mice were treated topically with 
2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) to induce AD-like symptoms and FOS was 
administered daily for 14 days. The results showed that FOS could alleviate 
AD-like skin lesions markedly as evidenced by dramatic decreases in severity 
score, scratching bouts, the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and T helper 
1(Th1)/Th2-related cytokines, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells and 
mast cells to the dermal tissues. The comorbid anxiety and depressive-like 
behaviors, estimated by the forced swimming test (FST), the tail-suspension test 
(TST), the open-field test (OFT), and the zero maze test (ZMT) in AD mice, were 
significantly attenuated by FOS. Fructo-oligofructose significantly upregulated 
brain neurotransmitters levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA). 
Furthermore, FOS treatment increased the relative abundance of gut microbiota, 
such as Prevotella and Lactobacillus and the concentrations of short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs), especially acetate and iso-butyrate in the feces of AD mice. The 
correlation analysis indicated that the reshaped gut microbiome composition and 
enhanced SCFAs formation are associated with skin inflammation and behavioral 
alteration.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data identify FOS as a promising 
microbiota-targeted treatment for AD-like skin inflammation and comorbid anxiety 
and depressive-like behaviors. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

INTRODUCTION: Lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) is often colonised by 
Staphylococcus aureus and the bacterial abundance increases during a flare. 
However, the role of S. aureus and the skin microbiome in the pathogenesis of 
AD, including its influence on the dysfunctional skin barrier and immune 
response, remains to be elucidated. In this study, the temporal relationship 
between alterations in the skin barrier function, inflammation and microbiome is 
examined in adults with AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This clinical study consists of 81 adult patients with AD, 
as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria, and 41 age and sex-matched 
controls. The objectives are to examine alterations in the skin microbiome, skin 
barrier and immune response during (1) an untreated AD flare, (2) an AD flare 
treated with topical corticosteroids (TCS), (3) an AD flare treated with 
systemic dicloxacillin/placebo and TCS or (4) cutaneous exposure to either 
autologous S. aureus, staphylococcal enterotoxin B or a vehicle. Skin biopsies, 
tape strips, skin and nasal swabs are collected and analysed using RNA 
sequencing, multiplex immunoassays, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and 
16S rDNA. Blood samples are analysed for filaggrin gene mutations and leucocyte 
gene expression.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in 
the general population. Skin barrier dysfunction is the central abnormality 
leading to AD. The cause of skin barrier dysfunction is complex and rooted in 
genetic mutations, interactions between the immune pathway activation and 
epithelial cells, altered host defense mechanisms, as well as environmental 
influences that cause epithelial cell activation and release of alarmins (such 
as thymic stromal lymphopoietin) that can activate the type 2 immune pathway, 
including generation of interleukins 4 and 13, which induces defects in the skin 
barrier and increased allergic inflammation. These inflammatory pathways are 
further influenced by environmental factors including the microbiome (especially 
Staphylococcus aureus), air pollution, stress, and other factors. As such, AD is 
a syndrome involving multiple phenotypes, all of which have in common skin 
barrier dysfunction as a key contributing factor. Understanding mechanisms 
leading to skin barrier dysfunction in AD is pointing to the development of new 
topical and systemic treatments in AD that helps keep skin borders secure and 
effectively treat the disease.

Relationship Between Atopic Dermatitis and Food Allergy in Children.

Mehta Y(1), Fulmali DG(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Anatomy, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe 
Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by 
a compromised skin barrier due to a variety of reasons, such as hereditary 
predisposition, immunological overactivity, and skin microbiome disruption. 
There is strong evidence linking food allergies (FA) with AD in some children, 
and many children with AD develop asymptomatic food sensitivity. FA and AD are 
two frequent childhood illnesses that are closely related. Food allergies affect 
30% of kids suffering from moderate and severe eczema and can cause a variety 
of symptoms, including dry, cracked skin, rash, itchiness, oozing, and crusted 
skin. While preteens and teens with AD are commonly sensitive to environmental 
allergens including house dust mites, mold, pollen, or dander of animals, 
younger kids with AD typically exhibit sensitivity to food items like peanuts, 
milk, or eggs. A food challenge test (FC) should be used to confirm allergies 
before recommending a stringent diet that could be hazardous to the patient. 
While elimination diets continue to be the cornerstone of the management of FA, 
they should only be carried out under the guidance of a specialist. Topical 
treatments are crucial for all individuals with AD. Early skin care with 
emollients, topical steroid treatment, and early introduction of highly 
allergenic foods are promising methods of alleviating symptoms of AD.

INTRODUCTION: The pathogenesis of atopic diseases is highly complex, and the 
exact mechanisms leading to atopic dermatitis (AD) onset in infants remain 
mostly enigmatic. In addition to an interdependent network of components of skin 
development in young age and skin barrier dysfunction underlying AD development 
that is only partially understood, a complex interplay between environmental 
factors and lifestyle habits with skin barrier and immune dysregulation is 
suspected to contribute to AD onset. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate 
individual microbiome and immune responses in the context of environmental 
determinants related the risk of developing AD in the first 4 years of a child's 
life.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: The 'Munich Atopic Prediction Study' is a comprehensive 
clinical and biological investigation of a prospective birth cohort from Munich, 
Germany. Information on pregnancy, child development, environmental factors, 
parental exposures to potential allergens and acute or chronic diseases of 
children and parents are collected by questionnaires together with a meticulous 
clinical examination by trained dermatologists focusing on allergies, skin 
health, and in particular signs of AD at 2 months after birth and then every 6 
months. In addition, skin barrier functions are assessed through cutometry, 
corneometry and transepidermal water loss at every visit. These measurements are 
completed with allergy diagnostics and extensive microbiome analyses from stool 
and skin swabs as well as transcriptome analyses using skin microbiopsies.The 
aim is to assess the relevance of different known and yet unknown risk factors 
of AD onset and exacerbations in infants and to identify possible accessible and 
robust biomarkers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Ethical Committee of the 
Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich (reference 334/16S). All 
relevant study results will be presented at national and international 
conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

"What about my eczema do I love the most? The hurt? A scratch? The humiliation 
of the public? Oh, there are so many options available!" Studies have shown an 
association between atopic eczema (AE), a common inflammatory skin condition, 
and an increased risk of mental health problems. Despite this, experts are still 
examining the causes of the links between common mental diseases (such as 
depression and anxiety) and skin conditions. We collected studies that were 
published in the past 10 years. We searched the following databases: PubMed, 
PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Further relevant research 
was assessed by examining the bibliographies of eligible studies and related 
ones. Two reviewers looked at the titles and abstracts of the studies to see if 
they were eligible, and then they read the full texts. We went through eczema 
and depression relationships, their etiopathogenesis, molecular basis, immune 
response, the role of genetic factors, and possible interactions between neurons 
and the immune system. Another possible contributing factor could be a change in 
cutaneous microbiota in eczema patients. Part of the initial connection could be 
explained by psychological stress, which further leads to depression in eczema 
patients. Healthcare professionals treating eczema patients must be aware of the 
comorbidity of mental problems and the potential that people with poor mental 
health may need social or emotional support. Patients with eczema, especially 
youngsters, can benefit from routine health checks since they can help identify 
neuropsychiatric issues like depression early and lessen the burden of both 
physical sickness and poor mental health. Given that AE is a condition that 
appears to be related to depression and anxiety, more research with larger 
samples is needed to determine a potential role for targeted mental health 
screening in people with AE, as well as the possibility of mental health 
modification through improved AE control (e.g., using new biologic agents).

INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata (AA) is a nonscarring alopecia with an estimated 
global prevalence of 2% and limited data on the efficacy of current treatment. 
Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide recommendations based on best 
available evidence. It is unclear how many AA CPGs are available globally.
AIM: To systematically search for and identify CPGs on AA and to critically 
appraise their quality using validated tools.
METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify CPGs published between 
October 2014 and April 2021, using the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Guidelines 
International Network, Emergency Care Research Institute guidelines trust, 
Australian CPGs, Turning Research Into Practice database and DynaMed. The 
systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework. Three 
critical appraisal tools were used: Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and 
Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument, Lenzer's red flags and United States Institute 
of Medicine's (IOM) criteria of trustworthiness.
RESULTS: In total, six AA CPGs from seven manuscripts (one CPG was in two parts 
published in separate papers) were included. The majority (four of six) of the 
CPGs focused on treatment. Four CPGs (total of five papers) were in English and 
two CPGs were only available in the original language (one Russian and one 
Japanese). All AA CPGs demonstrated low quality in several domains in the AGREE 
II appraisal, including stakeholder involvement and applicability, with the 
latter being deemed the worst domain for all CPGs, with an average of 29%. The 
mean (SD) number of Lenzer's red flags for the included CPGs was 3.4 (1.5) out 
of a total of 8 possible red flags, while the IOM criteria showed 1.6 (0.8) 
'fully met' criteria and 3.1 (1.2) 'not met' out of a total of 9 criteria.
CONCLUSION: We found a limited number of AA CPGs, all of which had significant 
methodological deficiencies. We encourage guideline development groups to use 
validated checklists/tools to develop reliable and trustworthy CPGs.

BACKGROUND: Acute cutaneous inflammation causes microbiome alterations as well 
as ultrastructural changes in epidermis stratification. However, the 
interactions between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation status and 
the skin microbiome have not been fully explored.
OBJECTIVES: Hypothesizing that the skin microbiome contributes to regulation of 
keratinocyte differentiation and can modify antimicrobial responses, we examined 
the effect of exposure to commensal (Staphylococcus epidermidis, SE) or 
pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus, SA) challenge on epidermal models.
METHODS: Explant biopsies were taken to investigate species-specific 
antimicrobial effects of host factors. Further investigations were performed in 
reconstituted epidermal models by bulk transcriptomic analysis alongside 
secreted protein profiling. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed to 
explore the keratinocyte populations responsible for SA inflammation. A dataset 
of 6391 keratinocytes from control (2044 cells), SE challenge (2028 cells) and 
SA challenge (2319 cells) was generated from reconstituted epidermal models.
RESULTS: Bacterial lawns of SA, not SE, were inhibited by human skin explant 
samples, and microarray analysis of three-dimensional epidermis models showed 
that host antimicrobial peptide expression was induced by SE but not SA. Protein 
analysis of bacterial cocultured models showed that SA exposure induced 
inflammatory mediator expression, indicating keratinocyte activation of other 
epidermal immune populations. Single-cell DropSeq analysis of unchallenged 
naive, SE-challenged and SA-challenged epidermis models was undertaken to 
distinguish cells from basal, spinous and granular layers, and to interrogate 
them in relation to model exposure. In contrast to SE, SA specifically induced a 
subpopulation of spinous cells that highly expressed transcripts related to 
epidermal inflammation and antimicrobial response. Furthermore, SA, but not SE, 
specifically induced a basal population that highly expressed interleukin-1 
alarmins.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SA-associated remodelling of the 
epidermis is compartmentalized to different keratinocyte populations. 
Elucidating the mechanisms regulating bacterial sensing-triggered inflammatory 
responses within tissues will enable further understanding of microbiome 
dysbiosis and inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic eczema.

Ozone is a highly reactive oxidant molecule consisting of triatomic oxygen 
atoms. Ozone therapy can be achieved using ozonated hydrotherapy, ozonated oil, 
ozone autohemotherapy, and other innovative dosage forms of ozone products. 
Ozone is frequently used as a complementary therapy for various cutaneous 
diseases, including infectious skin diseases, wound healing, eczema, dermatitis, 
psoriasis, axillary osmidrosis, diabetic foot, and pressure ulcers. In addition, 
several studies have reported the superior potential of ozone therapy for 
improving skin and gut microbiomes, as well as antitumour and antiaging 
treatment. Ozone therapy is an emerging treatment strategy that acts via complex 
mechanisms, including antioxidant effects, immunomodulatory capacity, and 
modulation of local microcirculation. Studies assessing the mechanism of ozone 
have gradually expanded in recent years. This review article aims to summarise 
and explore the possible molecular biological mechanisms of ozone in cutaneous 
diseases and provide compelling theoretical evidence for the application of 
ozone in cutaneous diseases.

BACKGROUND: Few data exist on differences in treatment effectiveness and safety 
in atopic dermatitis patients of different skin types.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate treatment outcomes of dupilumab, methotrexate, and 
ciclosporin, and morphological phenotypes in atopic dermatitis patients, 
stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type.
METHODS: In an observational prospective cohort study, pooling data from the 
Dutch TREAT (TREatment of ATopic eczema) NL (treatregister.nl) and UK-Irish 
A-STAR (Atopic eczema Systemic TherApy Register; astar-register.org) registries, 
data on morphological phenotypes and treatment outcomes were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 235 patients were included (light skin types [LST]: 
Fitzpatrick skin type 1-3, n = 156 [Ethnicity, White: 94.2%]; dark skin types 
[DST]: skin type 4-6, n = 68 [Black African/Afro-Caribbean: 25%, South-Asian: 
26.5%, and Hispanics: 0%]). DST were younger (19.5 vs 29.0 years; P < .001), 
more often had follicular eczema (22.1% vs 2.6%; P < .001), higher baseline 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores (20.1 vs 14.9; P = .009), less 
allergic contact dermatitis (30.9% vs 47.4%; P = .03), and less previous 
phototherapy use (39.7% vs 59.0%; P = .008). When comparing DST and LST 
corrected for covariates including baseline EASI, DST showed greater mean EASI 
reduction between baseline and 6 months with only dupilumab (16.7 vs 9.7; 
adjusted P = .032). No differences were found for adverse events for any 
treatments (P > .05).
LIMITATIONS: Unblinded, non-randomized.
CONCLUSION: Atopic dermatitis differs in several characteristics between LST and 
DST. Skin type may influence treatment effectiveness of dupilumab.

[Evaluation of the effectiveness of ultratonotherapy in patients with microbial 
eczema].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

Microbial eczema is a chronic dermatosis with a complex pathogenesis. The result 
of exposure to various endo- and exogenous trigger factors is the formation of 
skin dysbiosis in lesions with a predominance of opportunistic and pathogenic 
flora and, as a result, the development of sensitization. As the main therapy 
for dysbiotic disorders, it is customary to use antibacterial drugs. However, 
often the use of systemic antibacterial drugs is not justified and leads to an 
aggravation of the problem of antibiotic resistance.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of the use of alternating 
current on the skin microbiome in the complex therapy of patients with microbial 
eczema.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 2 groups of 30 patients with chronic moderate course of 
microbial eczema in the acute stage were examined. In the comparison group, 
therapy was carried out in accordance with the Federal Clinical Guidelines 
(antihistamines, detoxification, systemic antibacterial drugs, external combined 
agents, including a corticosteroid and an antibiotic). Patients of the main 
group received similar therapy without systemic antibiotics. In addition, to 
influence the pathogenic microflora of the skin in the lesion in the main group, 
procedures with supratonal alternating current of low strength were also used. 
The control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers. The results were evaluated 
according to the clinical picture, laboratory parameters of bacteriological 
examination.
RESULTS: During therapy, in patients of the main group and in the comparison 
group, a positive dynamics of the skin pathological process was noted, and a 
decrease in microbial colonization of the skin in the lesions of microbial 
eczema was observed by 4 and 3 times, respectively (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The proposed method of treatment is not inferior in terms of the 
effectiveness of traditional therapy, allows to achieve positive clinical 
dynamics in similar terms, as well as to avoid the widespread use of systemic 
antibacterial drugs in cases of moderate dermatosis.

Publisher: Микробная экзема — хронический дерматоз со сложным патогенезом. В 
результате воздействия различных эндо- и экзогенных триггерных факторов 
происходит формирование дисбиоза кожи в очагах поражения с преобладанием 
условно-патогенной и патогенной флоры и, как следствие, развитие сенсибилизации. 
В качестве основной терапии дисбиотических нарушений принято использовать 
антибактериальные препараты. Однако во многих случаях применение системных 
антибактериальных препаратов необоснованно и приводит к усугублению проблемы 
антибиотикорезистентности.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценить эффективность воздействия переменного тока на 
микробиом кожи в комплексной терапии больных микробной экземой.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Сформированы две группы по 30 пациентов с хроническим 
среднетяжелым течением микробной экземы в стадии обострения. В группе сравнения 
проводили терапию в соответствии с Федеральными клиническими рекомендациями 
(антигистаминные, детоксикационные, системные антибактериальные препараты, 
наружные комбинированные средства, включающие кортикостероид и антибиотик). 
Пациентам основной группы аналогичную терапию проводили без системных 
антибиотиков. Кроме того, для воздействия на патогенную микрофлору кожи в очаге 
поражения в основной группе также применяли процедуры ультратонотерапии. Группу 
контроля составили 30 здоровых добровольцев. Результаты оценивали по клинической 
картине, лабораторным показателям бактериологического исследования.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: На фоне терапии у пациентов основной группы и в группе сравнения 
отмечена положительная динамика кожного патологического процесса, а также 
наблюдалось уменьшение микробной колонизации кожи в очагах поражения микробной 
экземы в 4 и 3 раза соответственно (p<0,05).
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Предложенный метод лечения не уступает по эффективности традиционной 
терапии, позволяет достигать положительной клинической динамики в аналогичные 
сроки, а также избегать широкого использования системных антибактериальных 
препаратов в случаях среднетяжелого течения дерматоза.

Despite the increasing knowledge about factors shaping the human microbiome, the 
host genetic factors that modulate the skin-microbiome interactions are still 
largely understudied. This contrasts with recent efforts to characterize host 
genes that influence the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effect of 
genetics on skin microbiota across three different skin microenvironments 
through meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of two 
population-based German cohorts. We identified 23 genome-wide significant loci 
harboring 30 candidate genes involved in innate immune signaling, environmental 
sensing, cell differentiation, proliferation and fibroblast activity. However, 
no locus passed the strict threshold for study-wide significance 
(P < 6.3 × 10-10 for 80 features included in the analysis). Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis indicated the influence of staphylococci on 
eczema/dermatitis and suggested modulating effects of the microbiota on other 
skin diseases. Finally, transcriptional profiles of keratinocytes significantly 
changed after in vitro co-culturing with Staphylococcus epidermidis, chosen as a 
representative of skin commensals. Seven candidate genes from the GWAS were 
found overlapping with differential expression in the co-culturing experiments, 
warranting further research of the skin commensal and host genetic makeup 
interaction.

Why Does Facial Eczema Differ From Body Eczema?

Contento M, Maher J, Cline A, Rose S.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) is multifactorial, 
influenced by genetics, skin barrier dysfunction, and environmental stressors. 
There is a lack of research comparing the etiologies and pathologic mechanisms 
accounting for differences in facial vs body eczema.
OBJECTIVES: To explore reasons why facial eczema may differ from body eczema.
RESULTS: There are key differences in the environments of the face and body that 
may lead to AD exacerbation. These include differences in the skin microbiome, 
sebaceous glands concentration, and levels of natural moisturizing factor. The 
face is exposed to more environmental stress compared with the rest of the body. 
These stresses include aeroallergens, ultraviolet radiation, and cosmetic 
products. Management of facial eczema also differs from that of body eczema due 
to the avoidance of high potency topical steroids on the face. Topical steroids 
increase microbiome diversity, and lack of topical steroid use on the face can 
lead to decreased microbiome diversity and increased AD severity.
CONCLUSION: Facial and body eczema differ due to differences seen in anatomical 
structure and environmental exposures. These differences should be further 
researched and used in the management of facial vs body eczema and can also be 
used in the development of new AD treatments. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(10):

Skin disorders of different etiology, such as dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, 
eczema, psoriasis, wounds, burns, and others, are widely spread in the 
population. In severe cases, they require the topical application of drugs, such 
as antibiotics, steroids, and calcineurin inhibitors. With milder symptoms, 
which do not require acute pharmacological interventions, medications, dietary 
supplements, and cosmetic products of plant material origin are gaining greater 
popularity among professionals and patients. They are applied in various 
pharmaceutical forms, such as raw infusions, tinctures, creams, and ointments. 
Although plant-based formulations have been used by humankind since ancient 
times, it is often unclear what the mechanisms of the observed beneficial 
effects are. Recent advances in the contribution of the skin microbiota in 
maintaining skin homeostasis can shed new light on understanding the activity of 
topically applied plant-based products. Although the influence of various plants 
on skin-related ailments are well documented in vivo and in vitro, little is 
known about the interaction with the network of the skin microbial ecosystem. 
The review aims to summarize the hitherto scientific data on plant-based topical 
preparations used in Poland and Ukraine and indicate future directions of the 
studies respecting recent developments in understanding the etiology of skin 
diseases. The current knowledge on investigations of interactions of plant 
materials/extracts with skin microbiome was reviewed for the first time.

BACKGROUND: The TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) Registry Taskforce is a 
collaborative international network of registries collecting data of atopic 
eczema (AE) patients receiving systemic and phototherapy with the common goal to 
provide long-term real-world data on the effectiveness, safety and 
cost-effectiveness of therapies. A core dataset, consisting of domains and 
domain items with corresponding measurement instruments, has been developed to 
harmonize data collection.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to give an overview of the status and characteristics of 
the eight established TREAT registries, and to perform a mapping exercise to 
examine the degree of overlap and pooling ability between the national registry 
datasets. This will allow us to determine which research questions can be 
answered in the future by pooling data.
METHODS: All eight registries were asked to share their dataset and information 
on the current status and characteristics. The overlap between the core dataset 
and each registry dataset was identified (according to the domains, domain items 
and measurement instruments of the TREAT core dataset).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 4702 participants have been recruited in the 
eight registries as of 1st of May 2022. Of the 69 core dataset domain items, 
data pooling was possible for 69 domain item outcomes in TREAT NL (the 
Netherlands), 61 items in A-STAR (UK and Ireland), 38 items in TREATgermany 
(Germany), 36 items in FIRST (France), 33 items in AtopyReg (Italy), 29 items in 
Biobadatop (Spain), 28 items in SCRATCH (Denmark) and 20 items in SwedAD 
(Sweden). Pooled analyses across all registries can be performed on multiple 
important domain items, covering the main aims of analysing data on the 
(cost-)effectiveness and safety of AE therapies. These results will facilitate 
future comparative or joint analyses.

OBJECTIVE: Infantile eczema (IE), a common pediatric allergic skin disease 
caused by multiple inherent and external factors, is common in infants and young 
children, with skin lesions and itching as the main clinical manifestations. At 
present, its pathological mechanism has not been thoroughly clarified, but 
scholars believe that it is related to the joint action of various internal and 
external factors. This research aims to investigate the influences of bifid 
triple viable capsules plus cetirizine (CTZ) on gut microbiota (GMB) and 
immunity in children with eczema.
METHODS: The complete clinical data of 162 cases of IE presented between July 
2019 and July 2020 to the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University were 
retrospectively analyzed. Children treated by CTZ alone were assigned to the 
control group (n = 81) and those by CTZ plus bifid triple viable capsules were 
included in the observation group (n = 81). Therapeutic efficacy, adverse 
reactions (ARs), disease recurrence, as well as changes in GMB, inflammatory 
factors (IFs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) were observed.
RESULTS: The observation group was observed with a higher overall response rate 
and increased fecal Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and 
Bifidobacterium counts after treatment versus the control group. After 
treatment, reduced IgG and IgM, as well as IFs, were found in both groups, with 
lower levels in the observation group. A lower incidence of ARs was determined 
in the observation group.
CONCLUSION: With high efficacy for the treatment of IE, bifid triple viable 
capsules plus CTZ can validly regulate the GMB of children, improve their immune 
function and clinical symptoms, and reduce the disease recurrence rate, which is 
worthy of clinical promotion.

The aim of this study was to investigate the early-life development of the skin 
microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Nineteen infants with atopic dermatitis and 19 
healthy infants were evaluated 3 times, at 3 months intervals, within the first 
30 months of life. Tape-strips were collected from volar forearms, cheeks, and 
eczema lesions, and the skin microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. 
Both the community structure and richness of the skin microbiome of infants with 
atopic dermatitis differed significantly from that of healthy infants, with 
greater richness in healthy infants. For infants with atopic dermatitis, the 
community composition was not dominated by Staphylococci. For healthy infants, 
community composition and richness correlated significantly with age, while such 
a pattern was not revealed in infants with atopic dermatitis. This suggests a 
slower maturation of the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis, which precedes 
the staphylococcal predominance observed in older children and adults.

BACKGROUND: Since changes in the national guidance in 2011, prophylactic 
antibiotics for women undergoing caesarean section are recommended prior to skin 
incision, rather than after the baby's umbilical cord has been clamped. Evidence 
from randomised controlled trials conducted outside the UK has shown that this 
reduces maternal infectious morbidity; however, the prophylactic antibiotics 
also cross the placenta, meaning that babies are exposed to them around the time 
of birth. Antibiotics are known to affect the gut microbiota of the babies, but 
the long-term effects of exposure to high-dose broad-spectrum antibiotics around 
the time of birth on allergy and immune-related diseases are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine whether or not in-utero exposure to antibiotics 
immediately prior to birth compared with no pre-incisional antibiotic exposure 
increases the risk of (1) asthma and (2) eczema in children born by caesarean 
section.
DESIGN: This was a controlled interrupted time series study.
SETTING: The study took place in primary and secondary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Children born in the UK during 2006-18 delivered by caesarean 
section were compared with a control cohort delivered vaginally.
INTERVENTIONS: In-utero exposure to antibiotics immediately prior to birth.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Asthma and eczema in children in the first 5 years of 
life. Additional secondary outcomes, including other allergy-related conditions, 
autoimmune diseases, infections, other immune system-related diseases and 
neurodevelopmental conditions, were also assessed.
DATA SOURCES: The Health Improvement Network (THIN) and the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care databases and the Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES) database. Previously published linkage strategies were adapted 
to link anonymised data on mothers and babies in these databases. Duplicate 
practices contributing to both THIN and the CPRD databases were removed to 
create a THIN-CPRD data set.
RESULTS: In the THIN-CPRD and HES data sets, records of 515,945 and 3,945,351 
mother-baby pairs were analysed, respectively. The risk of asthma was not 
significantly higher in children born by caesarean section exposed to 
pre-incision antibiotics than in children whose mothers received post-cord 
clamping antibiotics, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence 
interval 0.78 to 1.05) for diagnosis of asthma in primary care and an incidence 
rate ratio of 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.11) for asthma resulting 
in a hospital admission. We also did not find an increased risk of eczema, with 
an incidence rate ratio of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to1.03) and an 
incidence rate ratio of 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.29) for 
diagnosis in primary care and hospital admissions, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to ascertain the exposure to pre-incision 
antibiotics at an individual level. The maximum follow-up of children was 5 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the policy change from post-cord 
clamping to pre-incision prophylactic antibiotics for caesarean sections during 
2006-18 had an impact on the incidence of asthma and eczema in early childhood 
in the UK.
FUTURE WORK: There is a need for further research to investigate if pre-incision 
antibiotics have any impact on developing asthma and other allergy and 
immune-related conditions in older children.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as researchregistry3736.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in 
full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 26, No. 30. See the NIHR Journals 
Library website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? Women giving birth by caesarean 
section are at risk of developing infections (such as wound infections) and are 
offered antibiotics at the time of their operation to reduce this risk. In 2011, 
the national guidelines changed from recommending antibiotics after cord 
clamping to giving them before the operation to further reduce the risk of 
maternal infection. During birth, the newborn gut is colonised by microbes. 
Antibiotics given to the mother before caesarean section can reach the baby 
through the placenta and disrupt the normal microbes that colonise the gut. 
These microbes are believed to play a role in the development of the immune 
system and altering the normal development of these microbes has been linked to 
children developing allergic conditions, such as asthma and eczema. This study 
investigated whether or not giving antibiotics before the caesarean section had 
a longer-term impact on children’s health.
WHAT DID WE DO? We used routine NHS information already collected by hospitals 
and general practitioners about women who gave birth in the UK between 2006 and 
2018, and their children. We compared the risk of asthma, eczema and other 
health conditions in the first 5 years after birth in children born by caesarean 
section before and after the change in hospital policies. We also compared their 
health with children born vaginally.
WHAT DID WE FIND? We found that there was no increased risk of asthma or eczema 
for children born by caesarean section after the policy decision in 2011 to give 
the mother antibiotics before the operation.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? The study findings provide further evidence for the current 
recommendation to give preventative antibiotics to women shortly before the 
caesarean section to reduce the overall risk of infections after birth.

INTRODUCTION: Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main intestinal 
intermediate and end products of metabolism of dietary fibers/polyphenols by the 
gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological implication 
of stool SCFA profiles determined in the first year of life on the clinical 
presentation of allergic outcomes in childhood.
METHODS: From the Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) 
cohort, a sub-cohort of 75 participants was recruited. Scheduled questionnaire 
data was collected for cumulative prevalence of physician-diagnosed eczema, 
wheezing with the use of nebuliser, and allergen sensitization till the age of 8 
years. Stool samples collected at week 3 and months 3, 6 and 12 were quantitated 
for 9 SCFAs using LC/MS/MS. SCFA data were grouped into lower (below the 25th) 
and higher (above the 75th percentiles) categories. Generalized Linear Mixed 
Models was employed to analyse longitudinal association between SCFAs and 
atopy-related outcomes.
RESULTS: Children with lower stool butyric acid levels (≤25th percentile) over 
the first 3 time points had higher odds ratio (OR) for wheezing (adjOR = 14.6), 
eczema (adjOR = 13.2), food sensitization (adjOR = 12.3) and combined outcomes 
of both wheezing and eczema (adjOR = 22.6) till age 8 years, compared to those 
with higher levels (≥75 percentile). Additionally, lower longitudinal levels of 
propionic acid (≤25th percentile) over 4 time points in first year of life was 
associated with recurrent wheezing (≥2 episodes) till 8 years (adjOR = 7.4) (adj 
p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that relatively low levels of gut SCFAs in early 
life are associated with increased susceptibility to atopic-related outcomes in 
childhood.

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is the most common inflammatory skin disease 
and has a significant burden on the quality of life of patients, families and 
caregivers. Its pathogenesis is a complex interplay between genetics and 
environment, involving impaired skin barrier function, immune dysregulation 
primarily involving the Th2 inflammatory pathway, itch, and skin microbiome. 
Restoration of skin barrier integrity with regular emollients and prompt topical 
anti-inflammatory therapies are mainstays of treatment. Systemic therapy is 
considered for moderate to severe disease. New understanding of inflammatory 
pathways and developments in targeted systemic immunotherapies have 
significantly advanced atopic dermatitis management. Dupilumab is a safe and 
effective treatment that is now available in Australia. Other promising agents 
for atopic dermatitis include Janus kinase, interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-31 
inhibitors.

OBJECTIVE: To inform readers of the current and forthcoming skin barrier 
interventions that have clinically relevant implications in the prevention of 
allergic sensitization and atopic diseases.
DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed journal articles indexed on PubMed and clinical 
trials referenced on clinicaltrials.gov were analyzed.
STUDY SELECTIONS: Literature searches from PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov were 
performed using combinations of the following search terms: prevention, allergy, 
atopy, skin, cutaneous, microbiome, microbiota, Staphylococcus aureus, atopic 
dermatitis, eczema, food allergy, and asthma.
RESULTS: The skin barrier represents an entry point for allergic sensitization 
and TH2-mediated allergic disorders. Results from clinical trials designed to 
improve microbiome complexity and reduce S aureus colonization, provide skin 
barrier enhancement, and deliver epicutaneous immunotherapy are summarized and 
discussed in the context of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of 
allergic disease.
CONCLUSION: The skin barrier is a promising target for prevention of allergic 
disease, though clinical trial results thus far have been mixed, at best.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest a link between eczema and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but underlying mechanisms have not been 
examined.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the association between eczema and subsequent 
ADHD symptoms in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort and 
explore the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gut microbiome.
METHODS: The modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood 
questionnaire and Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 
Version IV were administered to assess reported eczema within the first 18 
months and presence of ADHD symptoms at 54 months, respectively. Skin prick 
testing at 18 months, cytokines in maternal blood during pregnancy and cord 
blood and the mediating role of the gut microbiome at 24 months were assessed.
RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, eczema with or without a positive skin 
prick test was associated with doubling the risk of ADHD symptoms. No 
differences in maternal and cord blood cytokines were observed in children with 
and without eczema, or children with and without ADHD. Gut microbiome dysbiosis 
was observed in children with eczema and children with ADHD. Children with 
eczema also had lower gut bacterial Shannon diversity. However, the relationship 
between eczema and ADHD was not mediated by gut microbiome.
CONCLUSION: Early life eczema diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of 
subsequent ADHD symptoms in children. We found no evidence for underlying 
inflammatory mechanism or mediation by gut microbiome dysbiosis. Further 
research should evaluate other mechanisms underlying the link between eczema and 
ADHD.

The human microbiome encompasses the microorganisms that live in and on the 
body. During the prenatal and infantile periods, foundations for the cutaneous 
and gut microbiomes are being established and refined concurrently with the 
development of immune function. Herein, we review the relevance of the 
microbiome to 5 conditions commonly encountered in pediatric dermatology: acne, 
alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. 
Understanding the role microbes play in these conditions may establish the 
groundwork for future therapeutic interventions.

Potential Mechanisms of the Sparing of Atopic Dermatitis in the Diaper Region: A 
Scoping Review.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition commonly 
affecting infants with notable sparing of the diaper region. Though sources 
anecdotally attribute this sparing to the physical barrier formed by the diaper 
and the subsequent retention of moisture, urine, sweat and feces, no studies 
have formally investigated the factors contributing to this sparing phenomenon. 
We performed a scoping literature review to investigate the factors involved in 
sparing of AD in the diaper region, namely humidity, scratching, urine, sweat, 
feces, and microbiome composition. A total of 130 papers met the inclusion 
criteria, and extracted data were analyzed in an iterative manner. Increased 
local humidity facilitates protective changes at the cellular level and offsets 
transepidermal water loss. Exposure to urea from both sweat and urine may 
contribute to improved moisturization of the skin through its natural humectant 
properties and ability to modulate gene expression. Introduction of flora in 
feces contributes to the generation of protective immune responses and 
outcompetes growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, diapers 
physically prevent scratching, which directly interrupts the itch-scratch cycle 
classically implicated in AD. Our study reviews factors that may contribute to 
the sparing of AD in the diaper region in infants. A limitation to our findings 
is that the studies reviewed here explore the impacts of these factors on AD 
broadly, and not explicitly in the diaper region. Additional studies 
investigating this may further our understanding of AD pathogenesis and 
contribute to the development of effective therapeutics.

IMPORTANCE: Systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis are being evaluated 
primarily in placebo-controlled trials; network meta-analysis can provide 
relative efficacy and safety estimates for treatments that have not been 
compared head to head.
OBJECTIVE: To compare reported measures of efficacy and assessments of safety in 
clinical trials of systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis in a living 
systematic review and network meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, 
Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, Global 
Resource of EczemA Trials database, and trial registries were searched through 
June 15, 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials examining 8 or more weeks of 
treatment with systemic immunomodulatory medications for moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis were included after screening titles, abstracts, and papers in 
duplicate.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were abstracted in duplicate. Bayesian 
network meta-analyses and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence were performed. The updated 
analysis was completed from June to December 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes include change in Eczema Area and Severity 
Index (EASI), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (DLQI), and Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scales (PP-NRS).
RESULTS: Since October 2019, 21 new studies were added, for a total of 60 trials 
with 16 579 patients. Up to 16 weeks of treatment in adults, abrocitinib, 200 mg 
daily (mean difference [MD], 2.2; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.2-4.0; high 
certainty) and upadacitinib, 30 mg daily (MD, 2.7; 95% CrI, 0.6-4.7; high 
certainty) were associated with reduced EASI slightly more than dupilumab, 600 
mg then 300 mg every 2 weeks. Abrocitinib, 100 mg daily (MD, -2.1; 95% CrI, -4.1 
to -0.3; high certainty), baricitinib, 4 mg daily (MD, -3.2; 95% CrI, -5.7 to 
-0.8; high certainty), baricitinib, 2 mg daily (MD, -5.2; 95% CrI, -7.5 to -2.9; 
high certainty) and tralokinumab, 600 mg then 300 mg every 2 weeks (MD, -3.5; 
95% CrI, -5.8 to -1.3; high certainty) were associated with reduced EASI 
slightly less than dupilumab. There was little or no difference between 
upadacitinib, 15 mg daily, and dupilumab (MD, 0.2; 95% CrI, -1.9 to 2.2; high 
certainty). The pattern of results was similar for POEM, DLQI, and PP-NRS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 
abrocitinib, 200 mg; and upadacitinib, 30 mg daily, were associated with 
slightly better scores than dupilumab, and upadacitinib, 15 mg daily, was 
associated with similar scores to dupilumab. Abrocitinib, 100 mg daily, 
baricitinib, 4 mg and 2 mg daily, and tralokinumab, 300 mg, every 2 weeks were 
associated with slightly worse scores.

OBJECTIVE: An increase in the counts of the Demodex mites that exist in the 
microbiota of healthy individuals may lead to some dermatological diseases. This 
study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Demodex spp. among patients 
diagnosed with acne vulgaris, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, seborrheic 
dermatitis, eczema, and pityriasis folliculorum and the relationship between the 
demographic and clinical data of such patients and Demodex.
METHODS: This study included 144 patients (70 with acne vulgaris, 6 with 
pityriasis folliculorum, 15 with seborrheic dermatitis, 39 with rosacea, 8 with 
eczema, and 6 with perioral dermatitis) and 73 healthy subjects. We evaluated 
Demodex positivity using the standard superficial skin biopsy method in all 
groups. The presence of more than five Demodex mites per square centimeter was 
considered positive at the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 144 patients included in the study, 107 (74.3%) were female, and 
37 (25.7%) were male, while 40 (54.8%) of the 73 healthy subjects were female, 
and 33 (45.2%) were male. Twenty-one patients (14.5%) and five of the healthy 
subjects (6.8%) tested positive for Demodex. We found that Demodex positivity 
rates in the rosacea and acne vulgaris groups were higher than in the control 
group. However, this level was not statistically significant (p>0.05). We found 
the highest positivity rate among the patient groups in the pityriasis 
folliculorum (4/6, 66.7%), rosacea (8/39, 20.5%), and perioral dermatitis (1/6, 
16.7%) groups. Lastly, we found no statistically significant relationship 
between the demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups and Demodex 
positivity (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The present study is the only study that investigated Demodex 
positivity in six different dermatological diseases. Based on the results, we 
believe that investigating Demodex spp. positivity in dermatological diseases 
such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, and pityriasis folliculorum would be beneficial 
for early diagnosis and treatment.

Publisher: AMAÇ: Sağlıklı bireylerin mikrobiyotasında bulunan Demodex 
akarlarının sayısal artışına bağlı olarak bazı dermatolojik hastalıkların ortaya 
çıktığı düşünülmektedir. Bu çalışmada, akne vulgaris, rosacea, perioral 
dermatit, seboreik dermatit, egzama ve pityriasis folliculorum tanılı hastalarda 
Demodex spp. prevalansının ve bu hastalara ait demografik ve klinik verilerin 
Demodex ile ilişkisinin araştırılması amaçlanmıştır.
YÖNTEMLER: Çalışmaya 144 hasta (70 akne vulgaris, 6 pityriasis folliculorum, 15 
seboreik dermatit, 39 rosacea, 8 egzema ve 6 perioral dermatit) ve 73 sağlıklı 
gönüllü dahil edilmiştir. Demodex pozitifliği, tüm gruplarda standart yüzeyel 
deri biyopsi yöntemi ile değerlendirilmiştir. Tanıda cm2’de beşten fazla Demodex 
akarı görülmesi pozitif kabul edilmiştir.
BULGULAR: Çalışmaya alınan 144 hastanın 107’si (%74,3) kadın, 37’si (%25,7) 
erkek, 73 sağlıklı gönüllünün 40’ı (%54,8) kadın, 33’ü (%45,2) erkektir. Yüz 
kırk dört hastanın 21’inde (%14,5), 73 sağlıklı gönüllünün ise 5’inde (%6,8) 
Demodex pozitifliği saptanmıştır. Rosecea ve akne vulgaris gruplarındaki Demodex 
pozitiflik oranlarının kontrol grubuna göre yüksek olduğu, ancak bu yüksekliğin 
istatistiksel olarak anlamlı olmadığı tespit edilmiştir (p>0,05). Hasta grupları 
içerisinde en yüksek pozitiflik oranının sırasıyla pityriasis folliculorum (4/6, 
%66,7), rosacea (8/39, %20,5) ve perioral dermatit (1/6, %16,7) gruplarında 
olduğu saptanmıştır. Grupların demografik ve klinik özellikleri ile Demodex 
pozitifliği arasında istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bir ilişki bulunamamıştır 
(p>0,05).
SONUÇ: Bu çalışma, altı farklı dermatolojik hastalığın varlığında Demodex 
pozitifliğini araştıran literatürdeki tek çalışmadır. Çalışma sonuçlarına göre; 
rosacea, akne vulgaris ve pityriasis folliculorum gibi dermatolojik 
hastalıklarda Demodex spp. pozitifliğinin araştırılmasının erken tanı ve tedavi 
açısından yararlı olacağı düşünülmektedir.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease in 
which dry and itchy skin may develop into skin lesions. AD has a strong genetic 
component, as children from parents with AD have a two-fold increased chance of 
developing the disease. Genetic risk loci and epigenetic modifications reported 
in AD mainly locate to genes involved in the immune response and epidermal 
barrier function. However, AD pathogenesis cannot be fully explained by 
(epi)genetic factors since environmental triggers such as stress, pollution, 
microbiota, climate, and allergens also play a crucial role. Alterations of the 
epidermal barrier in AD, observed at all stages of the disease and which precede 
the development of overt skin inflammation, manifest as: dry skin; epidermal 
ultrastructural abnormalities, notably anomalies of the lamellar body cargo 
system; and abnormal epidermal lipid composition, including shorter fatty acid 
moieties in several lipid classes, such as ceramides and free fatty acids. Thus, 
a compelling question is whether AD is primarily a lipid disorder evolving into 
a chronic inflammatory disease due to genetic susceptibility loci in immunogenic 
genes. In this review, we focus on lipid abnormalities observed in the epidermis 
and blood of AD patients and evaluate their primary role in eliciting an 
inflammatory response.

Several factors have been shown to influence the composition of the bacterial 
communities inhabiting healthy skin, with variation between different 
individuals, differing skin depths, and body locations (spatial-temporal 
variation). Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease also affecting the 
skin-associated bacterial communities. While the effects of AD have been studied 
on these processes individually, few have considered how AD disrupts the 
spatial-temporal variation of the skin bacteria as a whole (i.e., considered 
these processes simultaneously). Here, we characterized the skin-associated 
bacterial communities of healthy volunteers and lesional and nonlesional skin of 
AD patients by metabarcoding the universal V3-V4 16S rRNA region from tape strip 
skin samples. We quantified the spatial-temporal variation (interindividual 
variation, differing skin depths, multiple time points) of the skin-associated 
bacteria within healthy controls and AD patients, including the relative change 
induced by AD in each. Interindividual variation correlated with the bacterial 
community far more strongly than any other factors followed by skin depth and 
then AD status. There was no significant temporal variation found within either 
AD patients or healthy controls. The bacterial community was found to vary 
markedly according to AD severity, and between patients without and with 
filaggrin mutations. Therefore, future studies may benefit from sampling 
subsurface epidermal communities and considering AD severity and the host genome 
in understanding the role of the skin bacterial community within AD pathogenesis 
rather than considering AD as a presence-absence disorder. IMPORTANCE The 
bacteria associated with human skin may influence skin barrier function and the 
immune response. Previous studies have attempted to understand the factors that 
regulate the skin bacteria, characterizing the spatial-temporal variation of the 
skin bacteria within unaffected skin. Here, we quantified the effect of AD on 
the skin bacteria on multiple spatial-temporal factors simultaneously. Although 
significant community variation between healthy controls and AD patients was 
observed, the effects of AD on the overall bacterial community were relatively 
low compared to other measured factors. Results here suggest that changes in 
specific taxa rather than wholesale changes in the skin bacteria are associated 
with mild to moderate AD. Further studies would benefit from incorporating the 
complexity of AD into models to better understand the condition, including AD 
severity and the host genome, alongside microbial composition.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of systemic therapies for atopic dermatitis (AD) 
often exclude patients based on age and comorbidities.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted a scoping review of observational studies and survey of 
International Eczema Council (IEC) members on the treatment of AD in patients 
with liver disease, renal disease, viral hepatitis, HIV, or history of 
malignancy.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, and Web of Science from 
inception to September 14, 2020. We mapped the available evidence on the use of 
cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, systemic 
corticosteroids, and dupilumab for AD in older adults (≥65 years) and adults 
with the previously mentioned comorbidities. We surveyed IEC members on their 
preferred systemic medications for each patient population.
RESULTS: We identified 25 studies on the use of systemic medications in special 
populations of adults with AD. Although IEC members preferred dupilumab as the 
first-line systemic agent across all special populations, many could not 
identify viable third-line systemic therapy options for some populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on systemic therapy for AD for older adults and adults with 
comorbidities are limited. Although IEC members' access to systemic therapies 
differs geographically, expert opinion suggests that dupilumab is preferred for 
those patients.

The skin is frequently exposed to chemical stress by organic chemicals or metal 
ions that can directly or indirectly challenge its immune components and may 
lead to T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The disruption 
of the skin's homeostasis by exposure to contact sensitizers (CSs) can trigger 
an inflammatory immune response that results in eczema and allergic contact 
dermatitis. The recognition of these chemicals depends on the expression of 
pattern recognition receptors on sentinel skin cells, mainly the innate resident 
immune cells orchestrating the skin's immune response and involving both 
oxidative and inflammatory pathways. The main driver of these both pathways is 
the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, a major ubiquitous regulator of cellular oxidative and 
electrophilic stress, activated in various innate immune cells of the skin, 
including keratinocytes and epidermal Langerhans cells in the epidermis and 
dermal dendritic cells in the dermis. Nrf2 also shows a strong protective 
capacity by downregulating inflammatory pathways. In this review, the important 
role of Nrf2 in the regulation of the immune response to CSs will be discussed 
and highlighted.

Ozone is widely used to inactivate bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In recent 
years, the treatment of itchy skin diseases (eczema and atopic dermatitis) using 
trace ozone has also received attention. However, the feasibility of using trace 
ozone to replace personal care products (PCPs) has rarely been analyzed. In this 
study, the applicability of trace ozone was evaluated in terms of its efficiency 
for microbial inactivation in three types of skin microbiomes, cleaning 
performance on simulated human hair and epidermis, safety for simulated human 
hair, and contribution to emission reduction. The results revealed that at a 
10:1 ratio of ozonated water to bacterial suspension, the inactivation ratios of 
Malassezia, C. albicans, and S. epidermidis reached 99.63%, 83.47%, and 100%, 
respectively. In addition, the cleaning performance of an ozone solution (0.4 
mg/L) for simulated human skin contaminated with carbon black and sebum could 
reach 95.89% and 95.63%, respectively, with 5 min of washing. The average scores 
were 0.40 and 0.37 after 5 min and 10 min of ozone treatments, respectively, 
indicating that trace ozone does not significantly damage simulated human hair. 
Results also revealed that the total emissions of COD, TP, and TN would be 
reduced by 1.29×106, 3.55×103, and 3.63×103 mg/ (household · year), 
respectively, if PCPs are replaced by trace ozone. In short, our findings 
indicate that trace ozone is a potential alternative to PCPs. By replacing PCPs 
with trace ozone, the use of synthetic chemical products can be reduced and 
carbon emissions from oil extraction can be countered.

BACKGROUND: Interactions between the skin barrier, immune system, and microbiome 
underlie the development of atopic dermatitis (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the skin and nasal microbiome in relation to filaggrin 
gene (FLG) mutations.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 77 children with difficult-to-treat 
AD. The entire encoding region of FLG was screened for mutations using single 
molecule molecular inversion probes and next-generation sequencing. Bacterial 
swabs from the anterior nares, lesional and nonlesional skin were analyzed using 
16S rRNA sequencing. For skin samples, additional qPCR was performed for 
Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of patients with a mutation in FLG was 40%, including 10 
different mutations. Analyzing bacterial swabs from all three niches showed a 
significant effect for both niche and FLG mutation status on the overall 
microbiome composition. Using a subset analysis to test the effect of FLG 
mutation status per niche separately did not show a significant association to 
the microbiome. Shannon diversity and S. aureus abundance were significantly 
affected by the niche, but not by the presence of an FLG mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest only a minor role for FLG mutation status on 
the overall microbiome, which is rather caused by differences in the present 
genera than by microbe richness and evenness.
