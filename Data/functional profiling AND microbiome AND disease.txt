The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in influencing various physiological 
processes and maintaining overall well-being, including the gastric system. 
Current diagnostic tests for gastric diseases often involve invasive procedures, 
sampling limitations, and medication effects, leading to potential diagnostic 
errors and discomfort to patients. Considering the connection between oral and 
gastric microbiomes, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the diagnostic 
potential of the oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing upper digestive 
endoscopy. Oral samples from 266 participants across two Brazilian sites 
(Belterra and Sao Paulo) were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis 
to identify microbiome composition across endoscopy outcome groups, exploring 
alpha and beta-diversity, richness, and differential abundance and prevalence. 
Prevotella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Streptococcus were the 
most abundant genera observed. No significant associations were found between 
alpha diversity profiles and endoscopy outcomes; beta diversity analyses 
similarly showed no correlations. Overall, the study did not establish the oral 
microbiome as a reliable marker for gastric health, underscoring the necessity 
for broader studies in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tests.

BACKGROUND: Asthma, a prevalent chronic inflammatory respiratory disease among 
children, was the focus of this study. Serum metabolism profiles were examined 
in patients diagnosed with both asthma and bronchiolitis by using ultra-high 
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
METHODS: In this study, the serum samples from three distinct groups-comprising 
patients diagnosed with asthma, bronchiolitis, and a healthy control 
group-underwent comprehensive non-targeted metabolomics analysis and targeted 
eicosanoid profiling.
RESULTS: Through both univariate and multivariate analyses, significant 
associations were observed between the pathophysiology of both asthma and 
bronchiolitis and aberrations in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
amino acids, purines, and pathways involving cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, 
indicative of inflammatory processes and immune responses. Furthermore, 
metabolic changes in phosphatidylethanolamine, saturated and monounsaturated 
fatty acids, and bile acids were observed in the asthma group. Bronchiolitis was 
distinguished by disruptions in acyl carnitine and phosphatidylcholine 
metabolism.
CONCLUSION: This study offers a new perspective on understanding the interplay 
of pathogenic mechanisms underlying both asthma and bronchiolitis. Its findings 
are significant for enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored 
to asthma stemming from bronchiolitis.

INTRODUCTION: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve 
chronic diseases. Probiotics have been found to have similar effects. However, 
the additive effects of HIIT in combination with probiotics supplementation are 
unclear. The aim of current study was to investigate whether there were additive 
effects when implementing both HIIT and probiotics simultaneously.
METHODS: Forty-seven obese middle-aged women (Age: 44.5 ± 5.94 years, body fat 
percentage: 40.0 ± 4.1%) were recruited and assigned into four groups: control 
group (C, n = 12), probiotics group (P, n = 12), HIIT group (H, n = 11), and 
HIIT with probiotics group (HP, n = 12). All the participants consumed 
probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TWK10, 6 × 1010 CFU/day) or placebo 
supplements daily. Exercise intervention groups conducted HIIT training (85-90% 
vVO2max for 2 min, followed by a 1-min inactive rest interval, repeated for 7 
cycles) 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. Anthropometry, cardiorespiratory 
endurance, blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 
the 8-week intervention.
RESULTS: After the intervention, there were significant changes between groups 
in the variations and rates of change in waist circumference, hip circumference, 
and TTE. The waist circumference in group H significantly increased compared to 
groups C and P, while group HP did not show significant difference compared to 
group C. On the other hand, the hip circumference decreased significantly in 
group HP compared to group C, and the decreased rate in group HP was 
significantly greater than in groups C and P. Furthermore, the increase rates in 
TTE were higher in group H and HP compared to group C.
CONCLUSION: HIIT improves TTE but negatively affects waist circumference 
compared to the control group. However, when combined with probiotics, the 
probiotics not only help enhance TTE but also counteract the negative impact on 
waist circumference and further reduce hip circumference, resulting in a 
synergistic effect.

SCOPE: Human milk (HM) is rich in bioactive compounds and essential nutrients. 
While research has focused on lipids, minerals, immune markers, microbiota, and 
oligosaccharides, specific metabolites are less studied. This study uses 
targeted metabolomics to identify and quantify metabolites in HM and explores 
the impact of perinatal and dietary factors on the metabolomic profile.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study of 123 healthy lactating women, 
HM samples were collected up to 1 month postpartum and analyzed using the 
Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Maternal and neonatal clinical, anthropometric, and 
nutritional data were collected. A total of 432 metabolites were quantified and 
categorized into 20 groups. The metabolomic profiles formed three distinct 
clusters, primarily driven by triglyceride concentration differences. 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were higher in HM from mothers with vaginal 
delivery compared to C-section births and differences in hexoses were found 
between exclusive and mixed-feeding practices. Maternal diets rich in lipids and 
animal proteins were associated with elevated amino acids, sphingolipids, and 
glycosyl-ceramides.
CONCLUSION: The HM metabolome was grouped into three clusters influenced by 
delivery mode, lactation practices, and maternal diet. This comprehensive 
analysis opens new avenues to explore HM composition and offers valuable 
insights for future dietary interventions aimed at modulating HM.

Functional constipation (FC) is a common digestive disorder that affects 
patients' quality of life and is closely associated with intestinal tumors. This 
study used a cross-sectional design to assess the changes of intestinal flora 
and metabolites in different severities of FC patients through 16S rRNA 
sequencing and metabolomics analysis. Results showed that patients with severe 
FC had significantly higher clinical and anxiety scores compared to those in the 
mild and moderate groups. The species richness of intestinal microorganisms in 
the severe FC group was also significantly higher, and obvious differences in 
the flora composition existed. Specifically, the Bacteroidota was more abundant 
in the severe FC group, which was a characteristic feature distinguishing severe 
FC. Metabolomic analyses also revealed metabolite differences among patients 
with mild-to-moderate and severe FC, with the severe FC group showing increased 
enrichment in L-isoleucine biosynthesis and glycolysis metabolic pathways. The 
short-chain fatty acid-targeted metabolome suggested that a decrease in butyric 
acid might be related to worsening constipation. This study suggests that 
specific flora and metabolic pathways could serve as potential diagnostic and 
therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the development of new diagnostic 
and therapeutic approaches to improve the quality of life and therapeutic 
outcomes for FC patients.

Our microbiota plays crucial roles in immune development and homeostasis and has 
been implicated in virtually all major diseases of the 21st century. 
Nevertheless, our understanding of the exact microbial functions that underlie 
these correlations remains extremely limited, due in large part to the 
difficulty of profiling cellular activities within non-model organisms and 
complex communities. Over the past decade, new flow cytometric approaches have 
been developed to distinguish specific microbial populations based on their 
interactions with metabolite analogs, modified biomolecules, and reactive 
compounds. By selecting and separating active microbes via 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, PRobe INcorporation for Targeted sequencing 
(PRINT-seq) has inspired innovative approaches to identify and characterize 
functional members of our microbiota. Here, we provide a broad overview of this 
evolving technology and summarize how this method has been recently employed as 
a diagnostic fingerprint for diverse microbial activities.

The human gut microbiome is a dynamic and intricate ecosystem, composed of 
trillions of microorganisms that play a pivotal role in maintaining overall 
health and well-being. However, the gut microbiome is constantly exposed to 
various environmental factors, including the bile produced by the liver, which 
can significantly impact its composition and function. Bile acids, secreted by 
the liver and stored in the gallbladder, modulate the gut microbiome, 
influencing its composition and function. This altered microbiome profile can, 
in turn, impact the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting an immunosuppressive 
environment that favors tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, changes in the 
gut microbiome can also influence the production of bile acids and other 
metabolites that directly affect cancer cells and their behavior. Moreover, bile 
acids have been shown to shape the microbiome and increase antibiotic 
resistance, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate relationships between bile, 
the gut microbiome, and the TME, highlighting the mechanisms by which this 
interplay drives cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Understanding 
these complex interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic 
strategies that target the gut-bile-TME axis and improve patient outcomes.

Since animal growth promoters (AGPs) are used in large quantities and commonly 
released to the environment from animal farms, it is necessary to determine 
whether such agents should be regarded as an environmental toxin that poses a 
threat to the ecosystem and health risk to wildlife. In this study, a 
multi-omics approach was employed to explore the effects of a representative 
AGP, lincomycin, on key metabolic and physiological functions of animals, using 
a mouse model. The results indicated that exposure to lincomycin resulted in a 
significant increase in growth rate of mice (50.11 %) over an 8 weeks period, 
during which significant decrease (61.94 %) and increase (68.64 %) in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Escherichia coli, respectively, was 
observed in the gut microbiota, indicating that the gut microbiota structure has 
been altered. Moreover, the mice exhibited altered lipid profiles and liver 
damage suggestive of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Disruptions in blood glucose and insulin levels associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also observed. Furthermore, lincomycin was found to cause 
suppression in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of 
related genes and elevated inflammatory mediators, potentially resulting in 
increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Our findings underscore the 
detrimental effects of lincomycin on animal health and highlight the necessity 
for comprehensive toxicological assessments of lincomycin and other AGPs before 
their environmental release.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a global health problem with limited 
therapeutic options. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to this disorder are 
not yet fully understood, and in this respect, metabolomics represents a 
promising approach to decipher metabolic events related to AUD. The plasma 
metabolome contains a plethora of bioactive molecules that reflects the 
functional changes in host metabolism but also the impact of the gut microbiome 
and nutritional habits.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the impact of severe AUD (sAUD), and of 
a 3-week period of alcohol abstinence, on the blood metabolome (non-targeted 
LC-MS metabolomics analysis) in 96 sAUD patients hospitalized for alcohol 
withdrawal.
RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of different lipids 
((lyso)phosphatidylcholines, long-chain fatty acids), short-chain fatty acids 
(i.e. 3-hydroxyvaleric acid) and bile acids were altered in sAUD patients. In 
addition, several microbial metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid, 
p-cresol sulfate, hippuric acid, pyrocatechol sulfate, and metabolites belonging 
to xanthine class (paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline) were sensitive to 
alcohol exposure and alcohol withdrawal. 3-Hydroxyvaleric acid, caffeine 
metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) and microbial 
metabolites (hippuric acid and pyrocatechol sulfate) were correlated with 
anxiety, depression and alcohol craving. Metabolomics analysis in postmortem 
samples of frontal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid of those consuming a high 
level of alcohol revealed that those metabolites can be found also in brain 
tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data allow the identification of neuroactive metabolites, from 
interactions between food components and microbiota, which may represent new 
targets arising in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases such as sAUD.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability among older 
people aged 60 years and above, with majority eventually being diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological agents approved for dementia include 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) inhibitors like rivastigmine, donepezil and 
galantamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine, 
prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with each other, depending on the 
severity of disease. There is currently no available study demonstrating the 
clinical response to these drugs for AD in the Filipino population. Hence, this 
protocol aims to characterise the clinical, genetic, microbial and metabolic 
factors associated with drug responses to donepezil, rivastigmine and/or 
memantine for AD in a cohort of Filipinos with late-onset AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol involves a multisite descriptive study that 
will use two study designs: (1) a descriptive, cross-sectional study to 
characterise the clinical profile of Filipino dementia patients with AD and (2) 
an exploratory prospective cohort study to investigate drug response-related 
genetic, gut microbiome and metabolome signatures of a subset of the recruited 
AD patients. At least 153 patients with mild or moderate AD aged 65 years old 
and above will be recruited regardless of their treatment status. A subset of 
these patients (n=60) who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included

according to their baseline medications and will be observed for treatment 
response in 6 months. The cognitive, functional and behavioural domains of 
patients and levels of functioning will be measured using different assessment 
tools. Drug responses of Filipino patients will then be investigated employing 
multi-omics technology to characterise genetic variations via whole exome 
sequencing, gut microbiome profile via shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 
metabolome profile via liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.

Viral hepatitis is a public health problem, about 1 million people die due to 
complications of this viral disease, the etiological agents responsible for 
inducing cirrhosis and cellular hepatocarcinoma are HBV and HCV, both 
hepatotropic viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in most cases. The 
regulation of the microbiota performs many physiological functions, which can 
induce normal intestinal function and produce essential nutrients for the human 
body. Metabolites derived from gut microbiota or direct regulation of host 
immunity and metabolism have been reported to profoundly affect tumorigenesis in 
liver disease. If the microbiota is unbalanced, both exogenous and symbiotic 
microorganisms can affect a pathological process. It is well understood that the 
microbiota plays a role in viral diseases and infections, specifically the 
hepatic portal pathway has been linked to the gut-liver axis. In HBV and HCV 
infections, the altered bacterial representatives undergo a state of dysbiosis, 
with subsequent establishment of the pathobiome with overexpression of taxons 
such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus. 
This dysregulated microbiome induces a microenvironment conducive to the 
development of hepatic complications in patients with acute and chronic HBV and 
HCV infection, with subsequent dysregulation of cytokines IFN-α/β, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
TGF-β, IL-6 and IL-10, which alter the dysfunction and damage of the hepatic 
portal system. In view of the above, this review aimed to correlate the 
pathophysiological mechanisms in HBV and HCV infection, the dysregulation of the 
microbiome in patients infected with HBV and HCV, the most altered cytokines in 
the microbiome, and the most altered bacterial representatives in the pathobiome 
of infection.

Recent studies confirmed that host-gut microbiota interactions modulate 
disease-linked metabolite TMA production via TMA lyase. However, microbial 
enzyme production mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we 
investigated the impact of dietary and intervention factors on gut microbiota, 
microbial gene expression, and the interplay between TMA lyase and glycolytic 
pathways in mice. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and 
metabolomics, the gut microbiota composition and microbial functional gene 
expression profiles related to TMA lyase and glycolytic enzymes were determined. 
The results revealed that distinct diets and intervention factors altered gut 
microbiota, gene expression, and metabolites linked to glycine metabolism and 
glycolysis. Notably, an arabinoxylan-rich diet suppressed genes linked to 
choline, glycine, glycolysis, and TMA lyase, favoring glycine utilization via 
pyruvate pathways. Glycolytic inhibitors amplified these effects, mainly 
inhibiting pyruvate kinase. Our findings underscored the crosstalk between TMA 
lyase and glycolytic pathways, regulating glycine levels, and suggested avenues 
for targeted interventions and personalized diets to curb choline TMA lyase 
production.

The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we 
perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, 
and healthy controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene 
functions, and antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External 
metagenomic datasets from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were 
analyzed to validate our multi-biome findings. We found that Enterococcus 
faecium and Bifidobacterium spp. were enriched in both diseases. Enriched 
Escherichia coli was characteristic of CD and was linked to numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes involved in efflux pumps and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli 
virulence factors. Virome changes correlated with shifts in the bacteriome, 
including increased abundances of phages encoding pathogenic genes. 
Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in UC and CD, 
respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli had negative 
associations with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in CD. 
Multi-biome signatures and their interactions in UC and CD showed high 
similarities between Japan and other countries. Since bacteria, phages, and 
fungi formed multiple hubs of intra- or trans-kingdom networks with SCFA 
producers and pathobionts in UC and CD, an approach targeting the interaction 
network may hold therapeutic promise.

Captive otters raised in zoos are fed different artificial diets, which may 
shape gut microbiota. The objective is to evaluate the impacts of two different 
artificial diets on microbial communities and function capabilities and 
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in healthy otters' feces. A total of 16 
Asian small-clawed otters in two groups (n = 8) were selected. Group A otters 
were fed raw loaches supplemented with commercial cat food (LSCF) diet, and 
group B otters were fed raw crucian diet. The communities and functional 
capabilities of microbiota in feces were assessed with metagenomic sequencing. 
Captive otters fed two kinds of diets possessed different gut microbial 
communities and functional capabilities. Various pathogenic bacteria, like 
Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, were enriched in the samples from 
the two groups, respectively. Most of the differential pathways of nutrient 
metabolism were significantly enriched in group A, and the distributions of 
carbohydrate enzymes in the two groups significantly differed from each other. 
Multiple resistance genes markedly accumulated in fecal samples of the group A 
otters with LSCF diet. Higher concentrations of SCFAs were also observed in 
group A otters. Two feeding strategies were both likely to facilitate the 
colonization and expansion of various pathogenic bacteria and the accumulation 
of resistance genes in the intestines of captive otters, suggesting that risk of 
pathogen transmission existed in the current feeding process. Commercial cat 
food could supplement various nutrients and provide a substrate for the 
production of SCFAs, which might be beneficial for the otters' intestinal 
fermentation and metabolism.
IMPORTANCE: Captive otters fed with different diets possessed distinct gut 
microbial communities and functions, with the enrichment of several pathogens 
and multiple resistance genes in their gut microbiota. The current artificial 
feeding strategies had the possibility to accelerate the colonization and 
proliferation of various pathogenic bacteria in the intestines of otters and the 
spread of resistance genes, increasing the risk of diseases. In addition, 
supplementation with commercial cat food had benefits for otters' intestinal 
fermentation and the metabolism of gut microbiota.

Metagenomic research faces a persistent challenge due to the low concordance 
across studies. While matching host confounders can mitigate the impact of 
individual differences, the influence of factors such as genetics, environment, 
and lifestyle habits on microbial profiles makes it exceptionally challenging to 
create fully matched cohorts. The microbial metabolic background, which 
modulates microbial composition, reflects a cumulative impact of host 
confounders, serving as an ideal baseline for microbial sample matching. In this 
study, we introduced miMatch, an innovative metagenomic sample-matching tool 
that uses microbial metabolic background as a comprehensive reference for 
host-related variables and employs propensity score matching to build 
case-control pairs, even in the absence of host confounders. In the simulated 
datasets, miMatch effectively eliminated individual metabolic background 
differences, thereby enhancing the accuracy of identifying differential 
microbial patterns and reducing false positives. Moreover, in real metagenomic 
data, miMatch improved result consistency and model generalizability across 
cohorts of the same disease. A user-friendly web server 
(https://www.biosino.org/iMAC/mimatch) has been established to promote the 
integration of multiple metagenomic cohorts, strengthening causal relationships 
in metagenomic research.

BACKGROUND: Aging can impair the ability of elderly individuals to fight 
infections and trigger persistent systemic inflammation, a condition known as 
inflammaging. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of inflammaging 
remain unknown.
METHODS: We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing of intestinal contents from young and 
old C57BL/6J mice to elucidate changes in gut microbiota diversity and microbial 
community composition after aging. Aging-related differential bacterial taxa 
were then identified, and their abundance trends were validated in human 
samples. The variances in intestinal barrier function and circulating endotoxin 
between groups were also assessed. Furthermore, widely targeted metabolomics was 
conducted to characterize metabolic profiles after aging and to investigate the 
key metabolic pathways enriched by the differential metabolites.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated an increase in relative proportion of 
pathogenic bacteria with age, a trend also revealed in healthy populations of 
different age groups. Additionally, aging individuals exhibited reduced 
intestinal barrier function and increased circulating endotoxin levels. Widely 
targeted metabolomics revealed a significant increase in various secondary bile 
acid metabolites after aging, positively correlated with the relative abundance 
of several aging-related bacterial taxa. Furthermore, old group had lower levels 
of various anti-inflammatory or beneficial metabolites. Enrichment analysis 
identified the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway as potentially the most 
significantly impacted signaling pathway during aging.
CONCLUSION: This study aimed to provide insights into the complex interactions 
involved in organismal inflammaging through microbial multi-omics. These 
findings lay a solid foundation for future research aimed at identifying novel 
biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of aging-related diseases or potential 
therapeutic targets.

The interaction between gut microbiota and the host immune system is a complex 
and understudied field, with cytokines like TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 playing 
pivotal roles. Commensal bacteria, including lactobacilli, respond to these 
cytokines through adaptive mechanisms that support their survival and function 
within the gut. While the influence of cytokines on pathogenic bacteria is well 
documented, their impact on commensal bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, 
remains underexplored. This study investigates the transcriptional responses of 
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strains K32 and R19-3 to various cytokines using 
next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our findings reveal that cytokines, 
especially IL-8 and IL-10, significantly alter the L. rhamnosus transcriptome, 
affecting genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress response, and 
transcriptional regulation. Notably, IL-8 and IL-10 induce a significant 
downregulation of genes related to the phosphotransferase system, suggesting a 
reduction in metabolic activity in response to inflammatory signals. This study 
unveils a previously unexplored aspect of L. rhamnosus adaptation, highlighting 
its intricate response to cytokine signals. By modulating gene expression, L. 
rhamnosus may mitigate the adverse effects of inflammation and promote gut 
health. These insights could inform the development of targeted probiotic 
therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other conditions with altered 
cytokine levels. Our results suggest that co-evolution between a host and gut 
microbiota enables bacteria to respond to specific cytokines through gene 
expression changes, revealing a unique and underexplored facet of the 
interaction between commensal bacteria and the host organism.

This study investigates the effect of reduced saliva production on intestinal 
histological structure and microbiome composition using a sialoadenectomy murine 
model, evaluating differences in saliva secretion, body weight, intestinal 
histopathological changes, and microbiome alteration using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing across three groups (control, sham, and sialoadenectomy). For 
statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparisons 
using Bonferroni correction were performed. p-values < 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. Microbiome analysis was performed using Qiime 
software. The results show that reduced saliva secretion leads to structural 
changes in the intestinal tract, including shorter and atrophic villi, deformed 
Paneth cells, decreased goblet cell density, and immunohistochemical changes in 
epidermal growth factor and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, especially at three 
months after surgery. They also showed significant alterations in the intestinal 
microbiome, including increased Lactobacillaceae and altered populations of 
Ruminococcaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae, suggesting potential inflammatory 
responses and decreased short-chain fatty acid production. However, by 12 months 
after surgery, these effects appeared to be normalized, indicating potential 
compensatory mechanisms. Interestingly, sham-operated mice displayed favorable 
profiles, possibly due to immune activation from minor surgical intervention. 
This study underscores saliva's essential role in intestinal condition, 
emphasizing the "oral-gut axis" and highlighting broader implications for the 
relationship between oral and systemic health.

The interaction between gut-residing microorganisms plays a critical role in the 
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), where microbiome dysregulation can alter 
immune responses, leading to unresolved local inflammation. The aim of this 
study is to analyze the immunomodulatory properties of a recently developed 
probiotic + amylase blend in the SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mouse model of CD-like 
ileitis. Four groups of SAMP mice were gavaged for 56 days with the following 
treatments: 1) probiotic strains + amylase (0.25 mg/100 µL PBS); 2) only 
probiotics; 3) only amylase; PBS-treated controls. Ilea were collected for GeoMx 
Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) analysis and histological evaluation. Histology 
assessment for inflammation indicated a significantly reduced level of ileitis 
in mice administered the probiotics + amylase blend. DSP analysis showed 
decreased abundance of neutrophils and increased abundance of dendritic cells, 
regulatory T cells, and macrophages, with a significant enrichment of five 
intracellular pathways related to apoptosis, in probiotics + amylase-treated 
mice. Increased apoptosis occurrence was confirmed by (TdT)- deoxyuridine 
triphosphate (dUTP)-biotin nick end labeling assay. Our data demonstrate a 
beneficial role of the probiotic and amylase blend, highlighting an increased 
apoptosis of innate immunity-associated cell subsets, thus promoting the 
resolution of inflammation. Hence, we suggest that the developed probiotic 
enzyme blend may be a therapeutic tool to manage CD and therefore is a candidate 
formulation to be tested in clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of various tryptophan 
metabolites in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and 
metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) at different stages of the 
disease. The present study included 44 patients diagnosed with MAFLD, 40 
patients diagnosed with ALD, and 14 healthy individuals in the control group. 
The levels of tryptophan and its 16 metabolites (3-OH anthranilic acid, 
5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxytryptamine, 6-hydroxymelatonin, indole-3-acetic 
acid, indole-3-butyric, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, indole-3-lactic acid, 
indole-3-propionic acid, kynurenic acid, kynurenine, melatonin, quinolinic acid, 
serotonin, tryptamine, and xanthurenic acid) in the serum were determined via 
high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. In patients 
with cirrhosis resulting from MAFLD and ALD, there are significant divergent 
changes in the serotonin and kynurenine pathways of tryptophan catabolism as the 
disease progresses. All patients with cirrhosis showed a decrease in serotonin 
levels (MAFLDp = 0.038; ALDp < 0.001) and an increase in kynurenine levels 
(MAFLDp = 0.032; ALDp = 0.010). A negative correlation has been established 
between serotonin levels and the FIB-4 index (p < 0.001). The decrease in 
serotonin pathway metabolites was associated with manifestations of portal 
hypertension (p = 0.026), the development of hepatocellular insufficiency (p = 
0.008) (hypoalbuminemia; hypocoagulation), and jaundice (p < 0.001), while 
changes in the kynurenine pathway metabolite xanthurenic acid were associated 
with the development of hepatic encephalopathy (p = 0.044). Depending on the 
etiological factors of cirrhosis, disturbances in the metabolic profile may be 
involved in various pathogenetic pathways.

Collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6RD) are a group of rare muscle disorders 
caused by mutations in specific genes responsible for type VI collagen 
production. It affects muscles, joints, and connective tissues, leading to 
weakness, joint problems, and structural issues. Currently, there is no 
effective treatment for COL6RD; its management typically addresses symptoms and 
complications. Therefore, it is essential to decipher the disease's molecular 
mechanisms, identify drug targets, and develop effective treatment strategies to 
treat COL6RD. In this study, we employed differential gene expression analysis, 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and genome-scale metabolic 
modeling to investigate gene expression patterns in COL6RD patients, uncovering 
key genes, significant metabolites, and disease-related pathophysiological 
pathways. First, we performed differential gene expression and weighted gene 
co-expression network analyses, which led to the identification of 12 genes 
(CHCHD10, MRPS24, TRIP10, RNF123, MRPS15, NDUFB4, COX10, FUNDC2, MDH2, RPL3L, 
NDUFB11, PARVB) as potential hub genes involved in the disease. Second, we 
utilized a drug repurposing strategy to identify pharmaceutical candidates that 
could potentially modulate these genes and be effective in the treatment. Next, 
we utilized context-specific genome-scale metabolic models to compare metabolic 
variations between healthy individuals and COL6RD patients. Finally, we 
conducted reporter metabolite analysis to identify reporter metabolites (e.g., 
phosphatidates, nicotinate ribonucleotide, ubiquinol, ferricytochrome C). In 
summary, our analysis revealed critical genes and pathways associated with 
COL6RD and identified potential targets, reporter metabolites, and candidate 
drugs for therapeutic interventions.

Probiotic therapy with Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) 
demonstrates potential as an adjunctive treatment for autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD). In a rat model of ASD induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection 
during pregnancy, we evaluated the effects of these probiotics on offspring. 
Administration of L. reuteri or LGG for three weeks post-birth improved social 
deficits and reduced anxiety in LPS-exposed rats. Additionally, probiotics 
significantly modified short-chain fatty acid profiles, increasing butyric acid 
levels and decreasing propionic acid levels. They also enhanced colonic barrier 
integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Occludin, and 
Claudin4. RNA sequencing identified differential gene expression in pathways 
related to inflammation, the HPA axis, and reactive oxygen species metabolism, 
with NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) emerging as a crucial gene. Validation studies 
confirmed that Lactobacillus strains reduced inflammatory cytokines, inhibited 
corticosterone secretion, increased antioxidant levels, and suppressed the 
NF-κB/NOX1 pathway. In an H2O2-induced oxidative stress model using Caco-2 
cells, pre-treatment with L. reuteri, LGG, or NF-κB inhibitors enhanced cellular 
antioxidants, inhibited NF-κB/NOX1 activation, and improved barrier function. 
Overall, L. reuteri and LGG administration improved social behavior, bolstered 
colonic barrier function, and mitigated HPA axis overactivation in LPS-exposed 
rats, while also alleviating oxidative stress in the colon and Caco-2 cells. 
These findings suggest that L. reuteri and LGG have substantial clinical 
potential for ASD treatment by targeting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, 
including inflammation, HPA axis dysregulation, and oxidative stress, thereby 
presenting a promising adjunctive therapeutic strategy for enhancing social 
behavior and gut health in ASD.

AIMS: Our study, employing a multi-omics approach, aimed to delineate the 
distinct gut microbiota and metabolic characteristics in individuals under 30 
with unclassified diabetes, thus shedding light on the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms.
METHODS: This age- and sex-matched case-control study involved 18 patients with 
unclassified diabetes, 18 patients with classic type 1 diabetes, 13 patients 
with type 2 diabetes, and 18 healthy individuals. Metagenomics facilitated the 
profiling of the gut microbiota, while untargeted liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to quantify the serum lipids and metabolites.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed a unique gut microbiota composition in 
unclassified diabetes patients, marked by a depletion of Butyrivibrio 
proteoclasticus and Clostridium and an increase in Ruminococcus torques and 
Lachnospiraceae bacterium 8_1_57FAA. Comparative analysis identified the 
combined marker panel of five bacterial species, seven serum biomarkers, and 
three clinical parameters could differentiate patients with UDM from HCs with an 
AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-1). Notably, the gut microbiota structure of patients 
with unclassified diabetes resembled that of type 2 diabetes patients, 
especially regarding disrupted lipid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite sharing certain metabolic features with type 2 diabetes, 
unclassified diabetes presents unique features. The distinct microbiota and 
metabolites in unclassified diabetes patients suggest a significant role in 
modulating glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, potentially influencing 
disease progression. Further longitudinal studies are essential to explore 
therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota and metabolites to modify 
the disease trajectory.

Qikui granule (QKG), a hospital preparation of traditional Chinese medicine, has 
been widely used for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in clinical practice. 
However, its holistic therapeutic effects and the underlying therapeutic 
mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the integrated analysis of 
network pharmacology, 16S rRNA sequencing, and non-targeted lipidomics was 
performed to explore the anti-DKD effects of QKG and the underlying mechanisms 
in db/db mouse DKD model. The results of the network pharmacology analysis 
identified the PI3K-AKT, EGFR, MAPK, JAK-STAT, FoxO, and AGE-RAGE signaling 
pathways as the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of 
QKG. Importantly, these signaling pathways were found to be closely related to 
lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The therapeutic effectiveness of QKG 
against DKD was manifested by reducing body weight, alleviating oxidative 
stress, improving kidney function indicators, promoting the recovery of renal 
histopathological damage, and regulating the lipid metabolic profile of serum 
and kidney in db/db mice. A total of 26 lipid metabolites were identified as 
potential pharmacological biomarkers (PPBs) of QKG for the treatment of DKD, 
which were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Meanwhile, QKG 
could alleviate DKD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis primarily by enriching 
Candidatus_Arthromitus, which showed a negative correlation with all 26 lipid 
PPBs as well as 5 biochemical parameters, including 2 oxidative stress factors 
and 3 kidney function indices. In conclusion, our findings suggest that QKG may 
upregulate the gut level of Candidatus_Arthromitus to suppress the abnormal 
activation of PI3K-AKT related signaling pathway, thereby reducing the levels of 
PC and LPC in the glycerophospholipid metabolism, to finally ameliorate the 
progression of DKD in db/db mice.

Bile acid (BA) and its receptor FXR play crucial roles in metabolism, and 
dysregulated BA synthesis regulated by hepatic and bacterial enzymes causes 
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, because ~ 75% of hepatic blood is from the gut, liver 
metabolism is influenced by intestinal bacteria and their metabolites. Thus, we 
used gut microbiota and metabolites from the urine and serum to uncover 
biomarkers for metabolic distress caused by Western diet (WD) intake, aging, and 
FXR inactivity. Hepatic transcriptomes were profiled to define liver phenotypes. 
There were 654 transcriptomes commonly altered by differential diet intake, 
ages, and FXR functional status, representing the signatures of liver 
dysfunction, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in healthy human 
livers and HCC. Machine learning approaches classified urine and serum 
metabolites for differential dietary intake and age difference. Additionally, 
the gut microbiota could predict FXR functional status. Furthermore, FXR was 
essential for differentiating dietary effects in colonizing age-related gut 
microbes. The integrated analysis established the relationships between the 
metabolites and gut microbiota correlated with hepatic transcripts commonly 
altered by diet, age, and FXR functionality. Remarkably, the changes in 
metabolites involved in the urea cycle, mitochondrial metabolism, and amino acid 
metabolism are associated with hepatic dysfunction (i.e. FXF deactivation). 
Taken together, noninvasive specimens and biomarkers are promising resources for 
identifying metabolic distress.

BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, 
predominantly among older adults. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations 
of gut microbiome and metabolome may play an important role in MC pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively characterize alterations of the gut microbial and 
metabolic composition in MC.
DESIGN: We established a longitudinal cohort of adult patients with MC and two 
control groups of individuals - chronic diarrhea controls and age- and 
sex-matched controls without diarrhea. Using stool samples, gut microbiome was 
analyzed by whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and gut metabolome was 
profiled by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
Per-feature enrichment analyses of microbial species, metabolic pathways, and 
metabolites were done using multivariable linear models both cross-sectionally 
comparing MC to controls and longitudinally according to disease activity. 
Lastly, we performed multi-omics association analyses to assess the relationship 
between microbiome and metabolome data.
RESULTS: We included 683 participants, 131 with active MC (66 with both active 
and remission samples), 159 with chronic diarrhea, and 393 age- and sex-matched 
controls without diarrhea. The stool microbiome in active MC was characterized 
by a lower alpha diversity as compared to controls and the remission phase of 
MC. Compared to controls, we identified eight enriched species in MC, most of 
which were pro-inflammatory oral-typical species, such as Veillonella dispar and 
Haemophilus parainfluenzae . In contrast, 11 species, including 
anti-inflammatory microbes such as Blautia glucerasea and Bacteroides stercoris, 
were depleted in MC. Similarly, pro-inflammatory metabolites, including 
lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens were 
enriched in active MC as compared to controls or MC cases in remission. 
Multi-omics association analyses revealed strong and concordant links between 
microbes, their metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles, supporting the 
tight interplay between disturbances in stool microbiome and metabolome in MC.
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant shift in stool microbial and metabolomic 
composition in MC. Our findings could be used in the future for development of 
non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring MC and developing novel 
therapeutics.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Microbiome dysbiosis has been proposed to 
contribute to microscopic colitis (MC) pathogenesis.However, previous studies 
have been limited by small sample sizes, reliance on 16S rRNA sequencing 
technique, potential confounding by stool consistency, and lack of functional 
analyses of microbiome and longitudinal data. Moreover, the metabolomic 
composition of MC remain largely unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this largest longitudinal MC cohort with two control 
groups - chronic diarrhea controls and controls without diarrhea, gut microbiome 
of MC is characterized by a lower alpha diversity, enriched pro-inflammatory 
oral-typical species and depleted anti-inflammatory beneficial species.Gut 
metabolome of MC shows significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory metabolites, 
including lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens. 
Multi-omics analyses demonstrate strong and concordant relationships between 
microbes, metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: Our findings could 
facilitate development of non-invasive biomarkers and novel therapeutics for MC.

Despite evidence linking the gut microbiome to neuropathic pain (NP), it is not 
known if altering gut microbiota can alleviate NP via the microbiome-gut-brain 
axis. This study examined if healthy gut microbiota of sham male rats (Sham+V) 
and dysbiotic gut microbiota of NP rats (spinal nerve ligation: NP, SNL+V) can 
be disrupted and restored, respectively, via fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) 
from the opposite group [Sham+(SNL-FMT) and SNL+(Sham-FMT), respectively]. All 
groups received FMT daily for two weeks, followed by three weeks without FMT. 
SNL rats showed higher mechanical hypersensitivity [SNL+V vs. Sham+V] throughout 
the study. After two weeks, the FMT of healthy gut microbiota decreased 
mechanical hypersensitivity in SNL rats [SNL+(Sham-FMT) vs. SNL+V]. A temporal 
shift in microbiome profiles after 2-week FMT treatment was observed in 
Sham+(SNL-FMT) and SNL+(Sham-FMT) groups, while the microbiome profile shifted 
back a certain extent after FMT ceased. At the end of study, the Sham+(SNL-FMT) 
group acquired low abundance of UCG-001, Odoribacter, and Peptococcaceae, and 
high abundance of UBA1819 and Victivallis. The SNL+(Sham-FMT) group maintained 
high abundance of Butyricimonas and Escherichia-Shigella. The SNL+(Sham-FMT) 
group had altered glial and macrophage activation/inflammation markers in the 
brain/colon than the SNL+V group. Relative to the SNL+V group, the 
SNL+(Sham-FMT) group had significantly lower gene expressions of GFAP 
(hypothalamus), IBA-1 (colon), and NF-κB (amygdala/colon), but higher gene 
expressions of complex I (amygdala/hypothalamus) and claudin-3 
(amygdala/hypothalamus/colon). In conclusion, FMT containing healthy microbiota 
given to SNL rats attenuates mechanical hypersensitivity, modulates microbiota 
composition, and mitigates downstream glial activation/inflammation markers in a 
NP model.

BACKGROUND: Advances in metagenome sequencing data continue to enable new 
methods for analyzing biological systems. When handling microbial profile data, 
metagenome sequencing has proven to be far more comprehensive than traditional 
methods such as 16s rRNA data, which rely on partial sequences. Microbial 
community profiling can be used to obtain key biological insights that pave the 
way for more accurate understanding of complex systems that are critical for 
advancing biomedical research and healthcare. However, such attempts have mostly 
used partial or incomplete data to accurately capture those associations.
METHODS: This study introduces a novel computational approach for the 
identification of co-occurring microbial communities using the abundance and 
functional roles of species-level microbiome data. The proposed approach is then 
used to identify signature pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). Furthermore, we developed a computational pipeline to identify microbial 
species co-occurrences from metagenome data at various granularity levels.
RESULTS: When comparing the IBD group to a control group, we show that certain 
co-occurring communities of species are enriched for potential pathways. We also 
show that the identified co-occurring microbial species operate as a community 
to facilitate pathway enrichment.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained findings suggest that the proposed network model, 
along with the computational pipeline, provide a valuable analytical tool to 
analyze complex biological systems and extract pathway signatures that can be 
used to diagnose certain health conditions.

Many human-targeted drugs alter the gut microbiome, leading to implications for 
host health. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well 
known. Here we combined quantitative microbiome profiling, long-read 
metagenomics, stable isotope probing and single-cell chemical imaging to 
investigate the impact of two widely prescribed drugs on the gut microbiome. 
Physiologically relevant concentrations of entacapone, a treatment for 
Parkinson's disease, or loxapine succinate, used to treat schizophrenia, were 
incubated ex vivo with human faecal samples. Both drugs significantly impact 
microbial activity, more so than microbial abundance. Mechanistically, 
entacapone can complex and deplete available iron resulting in gut microbiome 
composition and function changes. Microbial growth can be rescued by 
replenishing levels of microbiota-accessible iron. Further, entacapone-induced 
iron starvation selected for iron-scavenging gut microbiome members encoding 
antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. These findings reveal the impact 
of two under-investigated drugs on whole microbiomes and identify metal 
sequestration as a mechanism of drug-induced microbiome disturbance.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a major risk factor for gastric 
adenocarcinomas. In the case of the intestinal subtype, chronic gastritis and 
intestinal metaplasia are well-known sequential steps in carcinogenesis. H. 
pylori has high genetic diversity that can modulate virulence and pathogenicity 
in the human host as a cag Pathogenicity Island (cagPAI). However, bacterial 
gene combinations do not always explain the clinical presentation of the 
disease, indicating that other factors associated with H. pylori may play a role 
in the development of gastric disease. In this context, we characterized the 
microbial composition of patients with chronic gastritis (inactive and active), 
intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer as well as their potential association 
with H. pylori. To this end, 16 S rRNA metagenomic analysis was performed on 
gastric mucosa samples from patients with different types of lesions and normal 
gastric tissues. Our main finding was that H. pylori virulence status can 
contribute to significant differences in the constitution of the gastric 
microbiota between the sequential steps of the carcinogenesis cascade. 
Differential microbiota was observed in inactive and active gastritis dependent 
of the H. pylori presence and status (p = 0.000575). Pseudomonades, the most 
abundant order in the gastritis, was associated the presence of non-virulent H. 
pylori in the active gastritis. Notably, there are indicator genera according to 
H. pylori status that are poorly associated with diseases and provide additional 
evidence that the microbiota, in addition to H. pylori, is relevant to gastric 
carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Long-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID) 
develop in a substantial number of people following an acute COVID-19 episode. 
Red beetroot juice may have positive effects on multiple pathways involved in 
long COVID. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of beetroot 
juice supplementation on physical function, gut microbiota, and systemic 
inflammation in adults with long COVID.
METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was 
conducted to test the effects of 14 days of beetroot juice supplementation, rich 
in nitrates and betalains, on functional and biological outcomes in adults aged 
between 20 and 60 years with long COVID. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 
receive either daily oral supplementation with 200 mL beetroot juice (∼600 mg 
nitrate) or placebo (∼60 mg nitrate) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the 
change from baseline to day 14 in a fatigue resistance test. Secondary outcomes 
included the distance walked on the 6-min walk test, handgrip strength, and 
flow-mediated dilation. Secondary endpoints also included changes from baseline 
in circulating inflammatory mediators and metagenomic and fecal water 
metabolomic profiles. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) 
models were built to evaluate the differences in biological variables associated 
with the interventions.
RESULTS: Thirty-one participants were randomized in the study. Twenty-five of 
them (median (interquartile range) age 40 (10), 14 [56 %] women), received 
either beetroot juice (15) or placebo (10) and completed the study. At 14 days, 
fatigue resistance significantly improved from baseline (mean difference 
[standard error]: +21.8 [3.7] s; p < 0.001) with no significant differences 
between intervention groups. A significant increase from baseline in the 
distance walked on the 6-min walk test was observed (mean difference [standard 
error]: +30.0 [9.4] m; p = 0.03), which was not different between groups. 
Flow-mediated dilation did not differ between participants who received beetroot 
juice and those on placebo. PLS-DA models allowed correct classification of 
participants with 92.2 ± 4.4 % accuracy. Those who ingested red beetroot juice 
had a greater abundance of bacteria with well-known beneficial effects, 
including Akkermansia, Oscillospira, Prevotella, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae, and 
Turicibacter, compared with placebo. Participants allocated to beetroot juice 
supplementation were also characterized by significantly higher levels of fecal 
nicotinate, trimethylamine, and markers of beetroot juice intake (e.g., 
5,6-dihydroxyindole). Finally, higher levels of interferon gamma and macrophage 
inflammatory protein-1β were found in participants who consumed beetroot juice.
CONCLUSION: Beetroot juice supplementation for two weeks did not to induce 
significant improvements in functional outcomes in adults with long COVID 
compared with placebo. Beneficial effects were observed in both gut microbiota 
composition (i.e., increase in probiotic species) and inflammatory mediators.

BACKGROUND: The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score and grade are widely used to 
stratify patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) into different disease 
statuses and risk levels. Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the role 
of gut microbiota in autoimmune liver diseases. This study aimed to investigate 
the differences in gut microbiota among PBC patients with varying ALBI grades.
METHODS: Clinical data and stool samples were collected from outpatient and 
inpatient PBC patients between 2019 and 2022. Gut microbiota profiles were 
obtained using 16S rDNA sequencing of stool samples. We analyzed alpha 
diversity, beta diversity, LEfSe analysis and pathway function prediction. 
Additionally, various machine learning methods-including random forest (RF), 
lasso, gradient boosting machine (GBM) and support vector machine (SVM)-were 
employed to identify key features and to build and validate predictive models 
using bootstrap techniques.
RESULTS: Clinical characteristics of ALBI grade 1 patients were comparatively 
better than those of ALBI grade 2 and 3 patients, including multiple laboratory 
indices. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that species richness and balance were 
higher in ALBI grade 1 patients. Both the comparison of the most abundant genera 
and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in LEfSe demonstrated that 
Lachnospira had a higher abundance and better discriminative ability in ALBI 
grade 1. Pathway function prediction indicated that sulfur metabolism was 
upregulated in higher ALBI grades. Furthermore, RF identified 10 specific 
genera, which were then used to build and validate models for discriminating PBC 
patients according to their ALBI grades. All three models, developed using 
different machine learning methods, demonstrated good discrimination ability 
(mean AUC 0.75-0.80).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights significant differences in gut microbiota 
profiles among PBC patients with different ALBI grades. The increased abundance 
of Lachnospira and upregulation of sulfur metabolism pathways are notable in 
patients with lower ALBI grades. The machine learning models developed based on 
gut microbiota features offer promising tools for discriminating between PBC 
patients with varying disease severities, which could enhance the precision of 
treatment strategies.

Asthma has become one of the most serious chronic respiratory diseases 
threatening people's lives worldwide. The pathogenesis of asthma is complex and 
driven by numerous cells and their interactions, which contribute to its genetic 
and phenotypic heterogeneity. The clinical characteristic is insufficient for 
the precision of patient classification and therapies; thus, a combination of 
the functional or pathophysiological mechanism and clinical phenotype proposes a 
new concept called "asthma endophenotype" representing various patient subtypes 
defined by distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. High-throughput omics 
approaches including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics and microbiome enable us to investigate the pathogenetic 
heterogeneity of diverse endophenotypes and the underlying mechanisms from 
different angles. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the 
roles of diverse cell types in the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of asthma 
and present a current perspective on their contribution into the bidirectional 
interaction between airway inflammation and airway remodeling. We next discussed 
how integrated analysis of multi-omics data via machine learning can 
systematically characterize the molecular and biological profiles of genetic 
heterogeneity of asthma phenotype. The current application of multi-omics 
approaches on patient stratification and therapies will be described. 
Integrating multi-omics and clinical data will provide more insights into the 
key pathogenic mechanism in asthma heterogeneity and reshape the strategies for 
asthma management and treatment.

In this editorial, we examined a recent article in the World Journal of 
Gastroenterology that focused on sepsis-associated liver injury (SLI) and its 
treatment. SLI is a serious complication of sepsis, primarily caused by 
microcirculatory disturbances, the gut-liver axis, and inflammatory responses. 
Specific treatment recommendations for SLI are lacking. The gut-liver axis 
represents a potential therapeutic target, with metformin showing promise in 
modulating the gut microbiome and enhancing intestinal barrier function. 
Although immunomodulatory therapies are being explored, anti-tumor necrosis 
factor agents and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists have not demonstrated 
significant clinical benefits. Statins may reduce liver inflammation and prevent 
injury in sepsis, but their clinical application is limited. Reduced D-related 
human leucocyte antigen expression on monocytes and lymphocytes suggests immune 
suppression in patients, indicating that corticosteroids could reverse clinical 
deterioration in severe infections and address adrenal cortical insufficiency. 
Current large-scale studies on glucocorticoid therapy for sepsis have yielded 
mixed results, likely due to inadequate assessment of the immune status of the 
host. Future research should prioritize the development of personalized 
immunotherapy tailored to patients' immune profiles, focusing on identifying 
novel indicators of immune status and advancing immunomodulatory targets and 
therapeutics for septic patients.

BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disorder with unclear 
molecular mechanisms. While current diagnosis is well-established, understanding 
of the gut-thyroid axis in HT remains limited. This study aimed to uncover novel 
molecular signatures in HT by integrating gut metagenome and host transcriptome 
data (miRNA/mRNA), potentially elucidating disease pathogenesis and identifying 
new therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We recruited 31 early HT patients and 30 healthy controls in a 
two-stage study (discovery and validation). Blood and fecal samples underwent 
RNA and metagenomic sequencing, respectively. Integrative analysis included 
differential expression, weighted correlation network, correlation and random 
forest analyses. Regression models and ROC curve analysis were used to evaluate 
the significance of identified molecular signatures in HT.
RESULTS: Integrative analysis revealed subtle changes in gut microbiota 
diversity and composition in early HT, increased abundance of Bacillota_A and 
Spirochaetota at the phylum level, and significant differences in 24 genera and 
67 species. Ecological network analysis indicated an imbalance in the gut 
microbiota with reduced inhibitory interactions against pathogenic genera in HT. 
Functional analysis showed changes in infection- and immune-related pathways. 
Three characteristic species (Salaquimonas_sp002400845, 
Clostridium_AI_sp002297865, and Enterocloster_citroniae) were identified as most 
relevant to HT. Analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles uncovered 
pathways related to immune response, inflammation, infection, metabolism, 
proliferation, and thyroid cancer in HT. Based on correlations with HT and 
interactions between them, six characteristic RNAs (hsa-miR-548aq-3p, 
hsa-miR-374a-5p, GADD45A, IRS2, SMAD6, WWTR1) were identified. Furthermore, our 
study uncovered significant gut microbiota-host transcriptome interactions in 
HT, revealing enrichment in metabolic, immune, and cancer-related pathways, 
particularly with strong associations among those 9 key molecular signatures. 
The validation stage confirmed improved HT classification accuracy by combining 
these signatures (AUC = 0.95, ACC = 0.85), suggesting their potential 
significance in understanding HT pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals novel molecular signatures linking gut microbiome 
and host transcriptome in HT, providing new insights into the disease 
pathogenesis. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the 
gut-thyroid axis but also suggest potential new directions for therapeutic 
interventions in HT.

The relevance of lifestyle, including diet and exercise, has been associated 
with improved learning and memory capacity, delayed age-related cognitive 
decline, and a reduced risk of neurodegeneration. Most neurodegenerative 
diseases are defined as complex multifactorial disorders in which genetic and 
environmental factors greatly contribute to their onset. Although inflammatory 
cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress itself might exert 
pro-inflammatory effects and an uncontrolled response could lead to a state of 
chronic inflammation. Anti-inflammatory dietary approaches unify the disciplines 
of nutrition, immunity, and neurology. Personalized dietary interventions will 
be developed based on an individual's genetic makeup, metabolic profile, and gut 
microbiota composition, thanks to advances in genomics, metabolomics, and 
microbiome research. The relevance of dietary patterns in decreasing 
inflammation relies on the role of specific antioxidant nutrients, which might 
contribute to a decrease in the levels of ROS. This review aims to summarize 
recent advancements in neuroscience and immunology that have revealed the 
crucial role that diet and the immune system play in brain function and disease 
progression. Nutrition influences the immune system, and in turn, the immune 
system impacts neurological health. This bidirectional relationship suggests 
that targeted nutritional interventions could modulate immune responses to delay 
or mitigate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases potentially. This 
approach focuses on the use of specific nutrients and dietary components that 
influence the immune system and inflammatory pathway. Key elements of 
immunonutrition include omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins and various 
bioactive compounds found in foods.

OBJECTIVES: In systemic sclerosis (SSc), gastrointestinal involvement is one of 
the earliest events. We compared the gut microbiota (GM), its short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs) and host-derived free fatty acids (FFAs) in patients with very 
early diagnosis of SSc (VEDOSS) and definite SSc.
METHODS: Stool samples of 26 patients with SSc, 18 patients with VEDOSS and 20 
healthy controls (HC) were collected. The GM was assessed through 16S rRNA 
sequencing, while SCFAs and FFAs were assessed by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: In patients with VEDOSS, an increase in Bacteroidales and 
Oscillospirales orders and a decrease in Bacilli class, Blautia, Romboutsia, 
Streptococcus and Turicibacter genera was detected in comparison with HC. In 
patients with SSc, an elevated number of Acidaminococcaceae and Sutterellaceae 
families, along with a decrease of the Peptostreptococcaceae family and 
Anaerostipes, Blautia, Romboutsia and Turicibacter genera was found in 
comparison with HC. Patients with SSc and VEDOSS had a significantly lower 
butyrate and higher acetate with respect to HC. In VEDOSS, an increase in 
Oscillospiraceae family and Anaerostipes genus, and a decrease in 
Alphaproteobacteria class, and Lactobacillales order was identified with respect 
to SSc. Moreover, patients with VEDOSS exhibited higher acetate and lower 
valerate compared with definite SSc.
CONCLUSION: A GM dysbiosis with depletion of beneficial anti-inflammatory 
bacteria (especially butyrate-producing) and a significant decrease in faecal 
butyrate was identified in patients with VEDOSS. This early GM imbalance may 
foster the growth of inflammatory microbes, worsening intestinal dysbiosis and 
inflammation in early SSc stages. The potential butyrate administration in early 
disease phases might be considered as a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate 
gastrointestinal discomfort and progression preserving patient's quality of 
life.

The composition of the gut microbiota is a known factor in various diseases and 
has proven to be a strong basis for automatic classification of disease state. A 
need for a better understanding of microbiota data on the functional scale has 
since been voiced, as it would enhance these approaches' biological 
interpretability. In this paper, we have developed a computational pipeline for 
integrating the functional annotation of the gut microbiota into an automatic 
classification process and facilitating downstream interpretation of its 
results. The process takes as input taxonomic composition data, which can be 
built from 16S or whole genome sequencing, and links each component to its 
functional annotations through interrogation of the UniProt database. A 
functional profile of the gut microbiota is built from this basis. Both 
profiles, microbial and functional, are used to train Random Forest classifiers 
to discern unhealthy from control samples. SPARTA ensures full reproducibility 
and exploration of inherent variability by extending state-of-the-art methods in 
three dimensions: increased number of trained random forests, selection of 
important variables with an iterative process, repetition of full selection 
process from different seeds. This process shows that the translation of the 
microbiota into functional profiles gives non-significantly different 
performances when compared to microbial profiles on 5 of 6 datasets. This 
approach's main contribution however stems from its interpretability rather than 
its performance: through repetition, it also outputs a robust subset of 
discriminant variables. These selections were shown to be more consistent than 
those obtained by a state-of-the-art method, and their contents were validated 
through a manual bibliographic research. The interconnections between selected 
taxa and functional annotations were also analyzed and revealed that important 
annotations emerge from the cumulated influence of non-selected taxa.

Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a small intestinal disorder found at a 
high prevalence in stunted children, is associated with gut mucosal barrier 
disruption and decreased absorptive capacity due to reduced intact small 
intestinal villi1-4. To test the hypothesis that intergenerational transmission 
of a perturbed small intestinal microbiota contributes to undernutrition by 
inducing EED5, we characterized two consortia of bacterial strains cultured from 
duodenal aspirates from stunted Bangladeshi children with EED - one of which 
induced local and systemic inflammation in gnotobiotic female mice. Offspring of 
dams that received this inflammatory consortium exhibited immunologic changes 
along their gut that phenocopied features of EED in children. Single nucleus 
plus bulk RNA-sequencing revealed alterations in inter-cellular signaling 
pathways related to intestinal epithelial cell renewal, barrier integrity and 
immune function while analyses of cerebral cortex disclosed alterations in 
glial- and endothelial-neuronal signaling pathways that regulate neural 
growth/axonal guidance, angiogenesis and inflammation. Analysis of ultrasonic 
vocalization calls in gnotobiotic P5-P9 pups indicated increased arousal and 
perturbed neurodevelopment in the offspring of dams harboring the 
inflammation-inducing consortium. Cohousing experiments and follow-up screening 
of candidate disease-promoting bacterial isolates identified a strain typically 
found in the oral microbiota (Campylobacter concisus) as a contributor to 
enteropathy. Given that fetal growth was also impaired in the dams with the 
consortium that induced enteropathy, this preclinical model allows the effects 
of the human small intestinal microbiota on both pre- and postnatal development 
to be ascertained, setting the stage for identification of small intestinal 
microbiota-targeted therapeutics for (intergenerational) undernutrition.

BACKGROUND: The infant gut microbiome undergoes rapid changes in the first year 
of life, supporting normal development and long-term health. While diet shapes 
this process, the role of fibers in complementary foods on gut microbiome 
maturation is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: We explored how the transition from human milk to fibers in 
complementary foods shapes the taxonomic and functional maturation of the gut 
microbiome within the first year of life.
METHODS: We assessed the longitudinal and cross-sectional development of infant 
gut microbiomes (N=68 infants) and metabolomes (N=33 infants) using linear mixed 
models to uncover their associations to dietary fibers and their food sources. 
Fiber intakes were assessed with 3-day food records (months 3,6,9,12) relying on 
CODEX-compliant fiber fraction values, and questionnaires tracked the overall 
complementary food introduction. Bacterial species were identified and 
quantified via MetaPhlAn2 from metagenomic data, and metabolomic profiles were 
obtained using four LC-MS methods.
RESULTS: We identified 176 complementary food fiber-bacterial species 
associations. First plant-based fibers associated to microbiota compositions 
similar to breastfeeding, and further associated with aromatic amino acid 
metabolites, including 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (Total dietary fiber - 
Complementary foods (g) - β=3.50, CI 2.48-4.52, p=6.53x10-5). Distinct fibers 
from different food categories showed unique associations with specific 
bacterial taxa. Key species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitznii, associated 
with oat fibers (g/MJ, β=2.18, CI 1.36-2.84, p=6.12x10-6), reflective of 
maturing microbial communities. Fiber intake during weaning associated with 
shifts in metabolite profiles, including immunomodulatory metabolites, with 
fiber effects observed in a source- and timing-dependent manner, implicated in 
gradual microbiome diversification.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing complementary dietary fibers during the weaning period 
supports gut microbiome diversification and stabilization. Even minor dietary 
variations showed significant associations with microbial taxa and functions 
from the onset of weaning, highlighting the importance of infant dietary 
recommendations that support the gut microbiome maturation during early life.

BACKGROUND: The importance of ethanol-based hand rubs (EBHR) to prevent health 
care-associated infections is undisputed. However, there is a lack of meaningful 
data regarding the influence of EBHRs on skin microbiome.
METHODS: Four nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit were included. After a 
leave of 14 days, samples were taken before the first hand rubbing action and at 
the end of shift, with continued sampling on days 1, 7 and 28. To analyze the 
hand microbiome, microbial cells were collected using the glove-juice technique. 
Pro- and eukaryotic community profiles were created using amplicon sequencing of 
16S and 18S rRNA gene markers.
RESULTS: On average, hand antisepsis was performed 108 times per 8-hour work 
shift. Microbial communities were dominated by typical taxa found on human skin. 
In addition, a clear nurse-specific (i.e. individual) microbiome signature could 
be observed. For Prokaryota, daily exposure led to the end-of-the-day 
microbiomes being more similar to each other across nurses. In contrast, 
longitudinal effect of 28 day-application revealed more similarity of the 
Eukaryotic community.
CONCLUSIONS: Frequent occupational use of EBHR did not adversely affect the 
composition of the human hand microbiome. Thus, daily hand antisepsis retains 
its significance as the most important procedure for infection control.

Mounting evidence suggests that the gut-heart axis is critical in the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The gut serves as the primary pathway 
through which Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infects its host, leading to acute viral 
myocarditis (AVMC). However, little is known about the role of gut microflora 
and its metabolites in the development of AVMC. The AVMC model was established 
by intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in mice. Then, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) 
gene sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) untargeted metabolomics profiling were performed to 
analyze the microflora composition and metabolic profile of colonic contents. 
Compared to the Control mice, the AVMC mice displayed a significant reduction in 
gut microflora richness and diversity, as revealed by an increased abundance of 
Proteobacteria and a decreased abundance of Cyanobacteria and Desulfobacterota. 
LEfSe analysis indicated that the main genera differing between the two groups 
were Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, 
Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Odoribacter. Based on the criterion of OPLS-DA 
VIP ≥ 1.0 and p-value < 0.05, a total of 198 differential metabolites (DMs) were 
identified in the gut, including 79 upregulated and 119 downregulated 
metabolites, of which lipids and lipid-like molecules accounted for the largest 
proportion. Notably, both altered gut bacterial taxa and metabolites were 
significantly enriched in the Lipid metabolism pathway, with Traumatic acid 
(TA), Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) being the key DMs in the pathway. Additionally, 
significant positive correlations (|r| > 0.80 and p < 0.05) were found between 
TA levels and Anaerotruncus and Bilophila abundance, between EPA levels and 
Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 abundance, and between DHA levels and 
Escherichia-Shigella abundance, respectively. CVB3 infection leads to notable 
alterations in gut microflora composition and its metabolic profile, which may 
participate in AVMC development. Our findings provide important clues for future 
in-depth studies on AVMC etiology.

BACKGROUND: Airway microbiome has been linked to asthma heterogeneity, yet 
little is known about the associations between airway microbiota and type 2 (T2) 
asthma phenotype and severity.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the relationship of nasopharyngeal (NP) and 
induced sputum (IS) microbiota to the phenotypic features of T2 asthma.
METHODS: NP and IS samples from subjects with T2 mild-to-moderate asthma (n=23) 
and severe asthma (n=21) and healthy controls (n=16) were analyzed. Bacterial 
microbiota and functional profiles were compared. The correlation between 
microbial communities and clinical as well as inflammatory features was examined 
in asthmatics of two statuses.
RESULTS: Differences in NP and IS microbiota were associated with T2 asthma 
phenotype. Alterations in NP microbiota were more reflective of T2 inflammation 
and severity, with additional stratification of a subgroup characterized by 
significant elevations in T2 inflammatory biomarkers and reductions in bacterial 
richness and diversity (P < .05). Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, 
Ralstonia and Rhodococcus were identified as hub taxa within NP microbial 
network in T2 severe asthma, which were prevalent in the entire airway and 
involved in bacterial functions including inflammatory and steroid responses (P 
< .05). The composition and diversity of IS microbiota were complex, with 
Veillonella as the most altered genus, showing an increase with increasing 
asthma severity.
CONCLUSION: Our work revealed the significant associations of microbiota 
perturbations throughout the entire respiratory tract to the extent of T2 
inflammation, phenotype and severity in T2 asthma. The specific taxa identified 
invite further mechanistic investigations to unravel their possibility as 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2 severe asthma.

BACKGROUND: Long-distance road transportation is a common practice in the beef 
industry, frequently resulting in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and 
compromised growth performance. However, a comprehensive investigation 
integrating clinical performance, physiological conditions, and nasopharyngeal 
microflora remains lacking.
METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the respiratory health and immunometabolic 
status of 54 beef calves subjected to a 3000-km journey. The respiratory health 
of calves was monitored over 60 days post-arrival using a modified clinical 
scoring system. Nasopharyngeal microflora and venous blood samples were 
collected at 3 time points: before transportation (A), 30 days post-arrival (B), 
and 60 days post-arrival (C), for 16S rRNA microbiomics, whole-blood 
transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and laboratory assays.
RESULT: Within the first week post-arrival, the appetite and mental scores of 
calves dropped to zero, while other respiratory-related scores progressively 
declined over the 60 days. The α-diversity of nasopharyngeal microflora in 
calves was similar at time points A and B, both significantly higher than at 
time point C. The structure of these microbial communities varied significantly 
across different time points, with a notably higher relative abundance of 
BRD-related genera, such as Pasteurella and Mannheimia, detected at time point A 
compared to B and C. The composition and gene expression profiles of circulating 
blood cells at time point A were significantly different from those at B and C. 
Specifically, higher expression levels of oxidative- and inflammatory-related 
genes, cytokines, and enzymes were observed at time point A compared to B and C. 
Higher levels of catabolism-related metabolites and enzymes were detected at 
time point A, while higher levels of anabolism-related metabolites and enzymes 
were observed at time points B and C. Additionally, significant correlations 
were found among microorganisms, genes, and metabolites with differing 
abundances, expression levels, and concentrations across time points. Stronger 
correlations were observed between calves' performance and nasopharyngeal 
microflora and immunometabolic status at time point A compared to B or C.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results confirm that 3000 km of road 
transportation significantly alters the composition and gene expression profiles 
of circulating white blood cells in calves, affects their metabolic processes, 
disrupts the balance of the respiratory microbial community, and leads to 
pronounced respiratory symptoms that persist for at least 60 days. During this 
period, the influenced composition and gene expression of circulating blood 
cells, metabolic processes, and nasopharyngeal microbial community gradually 
return to equilibrium, and the respiratory symptoms gradually diminish. This 
observational research indicates that transportation induces BRD in calves by 
disrupting the homeostasis of their immune function, metabolic processes, and 
nasopharyngeal microbial community. However, these results and their underlying 
molecular mechanisms warrant further validation through well-designed in vivo 
and in vitro confirmatory experiments with larger sample size. Video Abstract.

PURPOSE: Intestinal flora promotes the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
through microorganisms and their metabolites. This study aimed to investigate 
the composition of intestinal flora in different stages of CRC progression and 
the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on CRC mice.
METHODS: The fecal microbiome from healthy volunteers (HC), colorectal adenoma 
(CRA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and CRC patients were analyzed by 16s 
rRNA gene sequencing. In an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran-sulfate-sodium 
(DSS)-induced CRC mouse, the effect of FMT from HC, CRA, CRC, and IBD patients 
on CRC mice was assessed by histological analysis. Expression of inflammation- 
EMT-associated proteins and Wnt/β-catenin pathway were assessed using qRT-PCR 
and western blot. The ratio of the fecal microorganisms and metabolomics 
alteration after FMT were also assessed.
RESULT: Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Veillonella, 
Alistipes, Fusobacterium, Oscillibacter, Blautia, and Ruminococcus abundance was 
different among HC, IBD, CRC, and CRA patients. HC-FMT alleviated disease 
progression and inflammatory response in CRC mice, inhibited splenic T help 
(Th)1 and Th17 cell numbers, and suppressed the EMT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways 
in tumor tissues of CRC mice. IBD-FMT, CRA-FMT, and CRC-FMT played deleterious 
roles; the CRC-FMT mice exhibited the most malignant phenotype. Compared with 
the non-FMT CRC mice, Muribaculaceae abundance was lower after FMT, especially 
lowest in the IBD-FMT group; while Lactobacillus abundance was higher after FMT 
and especially high in HC-FMT. Akkermansia and Ileibacterium abundance increased 
after FMT-HC compared to other groups. Metabolite correlation analysis revealed 
that Muribaculaceae abundance was significantly correlated with metabolites such 
as Betaine, LysoPC, and Soyasaponin III. Lactobacillus abundance was positively 
correlated with Taurocholic acid 3-sulfate, and Ileibacterium abundance was 
positively correlated with Linoleoyl ethanolamide.
CONCLUSION: The different intestinal microbiota communities of HC, IBD, CRA, and 
CRC patients may be attributed to the different modulation effects of FMT on CRC 
mice. CRC-FMT promoted, while HC-FMT inhibited the progress of CRC. Increased 
linoleoyl ethanolamide levels and abundance of Muribaculaceae, Akkermansia, and 
Ileibacterium and reduced Fusobacterium might participate in inhibiting CRC 
initiation and development. This study demonstrated that FMT intervention could 
restore the intestinal microbiota and metabolomics of CRC mice, suggesting FMT 
as a potential strategy for CRC therapy.

BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates a close association between iron overload (IO) 
and the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, highlighting the potential for 
interventions targeted at IO to impede or decelerate the progression of chronic 
liver diseases. Diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), the medicinal form of 
glycyrrhizic acid, a principal constituent of licorice, has been clinically 
employed as a hepatoprotective agent; however, its protective effect against 
IO-induced liver injury and underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the hepatoprotective 
effect of DG against IO-induced liver injury with a focus on the gut-liver axis.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Animal models of IO-induced liver injury and DG 
treatment have been established in vivo. Iron deposition, liver injury, 
intestinal barrier damage, and liver inflammation were assessed in mice treated 
with iron dextran or DG. The microbiome composition in feces was analyzed using 
16S rRNA full-length sequencing. Bile acids (BAs) profiles in feces were 
detected by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique, and the expression levels of receptors, 
enzymes or transporters involved in BAs metabolism were also determined.
RESULTS: DG partially reduced the iron deposition and the levels of ferrous ion 
in the livers of mice with IO, thereby mitigating oxidative damage. DG also 
improved gut microbiota dysbiosis, repaired intestinal barrier damage, inhibited 
endotoxin translocation to the liver, and subsequently suppressed 
TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway-mediated liver inflammation caused by IO. Moreover, DG 
modulated BAs metabolism disorder in IO mice, reducing the accumulation of BAs 
in the liver.
CONCLUSION: DG alleviates IO-induced liver injury in mice by regulating the 
gut-liver axis. This study provides novel insights into the underlying 
mechanisms through which DG ameliorates liver injury caused by IO.

Personality, Aging, and Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for 
Psychoneuroimmunology and Personalized Medicine.

Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) advancements may revolutionize personalized medicine 
by identifying systemic biomarkers that enhance diagnosis and treatment. 
Inflammatory pathways connect personality traits with cognitive performance, 
aging-related disorders, and mortality risks. Studies have demonstrated the 
critical interactions between personality and various biological systems like 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The gut-brain axis also affects 
behaviors and psychological states in older adults, with specific gut microbiota 
influencing cognition, mood, and personality. These findings underscore the 
practical implications of understanding personality-biology interactions. They 
can support preventive and personalized medicine for aging-associated disorders. 
Specifically, personality changes are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients, impacting clinical management and caregiver stress. Non-cognitive 
factors, such as personality traits and psychiatric symptoms, may serve as early 
markers of AD. Traits like high Neuroticism and low Openness can predict initial 
AD stages, often before a formal diagnosis. Personality alterations in AD are 
also linked to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vascular imaging biomarkers, which 
can track AD pathology and serve as predictors. Dynamic personality assessment 
can aid in timely diagnosis, monitoring progression, and evaluating 
treatments of AD. Understanding personality traits is crucial for predicting 
burnout, lifespan, and intervention success. Integrating personality and PNI 
biomarkers into patient profiles will support the development of personalized 
and systems medicine.

Personality and Psychoneuroimmunology: A Systems Biology Perspective.

Yan Q(1).

Author information:
(1)PharmTao, Santa Clara, CA, USA. qyan@pharmtao.com.

Research in psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) underscores the intricate connections 
within the "whole mind-body system." Personality plays a pivotal role, with 
specific traits linked to stress influencing neural behavior and 
psychophysiological disorders. Gene expression networks associated with 
personality affect neuronal plasticity, epigenetic processes, and adaptive 
behaviors, highlighting the importance of systems biology mechanisms. Systemic 
inflammation correlates with key personality traits. Understanding the roles of 
inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers in personality traits and disorders can 
help identify diagnostic and therapeutic targets for various diseases. 
Neurobiological features contribute to our understanding of personality 
disorders and related conditions. Personality traits are linked to distributed 
neuroendocrine networks, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis, rather than localized brain areas. Correlations have also been identified 
between personality traits and thyroid hormones. Disrupted 
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis functions may be associated with 
disease severity, depression, and distress, highlighting the need for 
comprehensive endocrinological and psychopathological evaluations. The gut-brain 
axis influences personality traits, emotions, stress, and social behaviors. 
Altered gut microbiota is common in psychiatric conditions, suggesting potential 
treatments targeting the microbiota. Chronic stress impacts cognitive functions 
and correlates with personality and mental health, emphasizing the need for 
comprehensive, multi-dimensional patient profiles for effective prevention and 
therapy. A biopsychosocial model integrating personality traits will advance 
personalized and systems medicine.

Vanillic acid (VA) is a natural phenolic acid compound that is widely found in 
various foods and medicinal plants, with a remarkable antifibrotic effect 
observed in animal studies, but its exact antifibrotic mechanism remains 
unclear. Herein, hepatic function, fibrotic index, and histopathological, 
microbiome, and metabolomic methods were used to investigate the potential 
mechanisms behind the improvement effect of vanillic acid against thioacetamide 
(TAA)-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Our results showed that VA reversed 
TAA-induced liver fibrosis manifested a decrease in collagen fiber deposition, 
serum transaminase, serum hepatic fibrotic index, and liver inflammation 
indicator levels. When analyzed, TAA injection mainly increased the abundance of 
Akkermansia and Roseburia and significantly reduced the abundance of 
Anaerotruncus. VA reversed these changes back to normal levels to varying 
degrees. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated that VA treatment was efficacious in 
modulating several key liver metabolites involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor 
interaction, prolactin signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and 
glutathione metabolism. Conclusively, VA may ameliorate liver damage and 
suppress the fibrogenesis caused by thioacetamide by correcting intestinal 
microbiota disorders and promoting normal hepatic metabolism. This research 
provides a novel perspective on vanillic acid as a dietary supplement for 
hepatic fibrosis improvement.

INTRODUCTION: The homeostasis of the microbiome in lower respiratory tract is 
crucial in sustaining normal physiological functions of the lung. Different 
pulmonary diseases display varying degrees of microbiome imbalance; however, the 
specific variability and clinical significance of their microbiomes remain 
largely unexplored.
METHODS: In this study, we delineated the pathogen spectrum and commensal 
microorganisms in the lower respiratory tract of various pulmonary diseases 
using metagenomic sequencing. We analyzed the disparities and commonalities of 
the microbial features and examined their correlation with disease 
characteristics.
RESULTS: We observed distinct pathogen profiles and a diversity in lower airway 
microbiome in patients diagnosed with cancer, interstitial lung disease, 
bronchiectasis, common pneumonia, Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pneumonia, 
and severe pneumonia.
DISCUSSION: This study illustrates the utility of Metagenomic Next-generation 
Sequencing (mNGS) in identifying pathogens and analyzing the lower respiratory 
microbiome, which is important for understanding the microbiological aspect of 
pulmonary diseases and essential for their early and precise diagnosis.

IMPORTANCE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is linked with alterations 
in the gut microbiome. The influence of adenotonsillectomy (AT), a primary 
intervention for OSA, on gut microbiota dynamics relative to disease severity 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of OSA severity and AT on 
the gut microbiome in pediatric patients.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 55 pediatric patients treated with AT for OSA.
INTERVENTION: Total tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive evaluations included in-laboratory 
polysomnography and 16S rRNA gut microbiome profiling at baseline, and again at 
3rd and 12thmonth following surgery.
RESULTS: Initial findings showed uniform α-diversity across different severities 
of OSA, while β-diversity was significantly elevated in the severe OSA subgroup. 
Certain gut microbiota taxa (Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Ruminococcaceae 
UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Alloprevotella, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, 
Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Lactobacillus murinus, and Prevotella nigrescens) were 
found to inversely correlate with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Significant 
post-AT improvements in AHI and other polysomnographic metrics were observed. 
Notably, AHI changes post-AT were positively associated with microbial 
α-diversity (species richness), β-diversity, and specific bacterial taxa 
(Enterobacter, Parasutterella, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Bacteroides plebeius 
DSM 17135), but negatively with other taxa (Fusicatenibacter, Bifidobacterium, 
UBA1819, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. Longum, and 
Parabacteroides distasonis) and specific metabolic pathways (purine metabolism, 
transcription factors, and type II diabetes mellitus). The postoperative 
patterns of α- and β-diversity mirrored baseline values.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study documents significant changes in the gut 
microbiome of pediatric patients after AT, including variations in α- and 
β-diversities, bacterial communities, and inferred metabolic functions. These 
changes suggest a potential association between the surgical intervention and 
microbiome alterations, although further studies are necessary to discern the 
specific contributions of AT amidst possible confounding factors such as 
antibiotic use.

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective in 
reversing gut dysbiosis, we lack an understanding of the fundamental processes 
underlying microbial engraftment in the mammalian gut. Here, we explored a 
murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in 
gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a 
natural "super-donor" consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients 
and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome 
showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 
h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, 
engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract 
in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested 
engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing 
species from the super-donor consortia. These results offer a mechanism of 
super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a 
spatiotemporally dependent manner. A record of this paper's transparent peer 
review process is included in the supplemental information.

Streptomycin (Str) and oxytetracycline (Otc) are widely used antibiotics to 
manage bacterial diseases in citrus and other crops. However, their impacts on 
the rhizosphere bacterial assembly and plant physiology are poorly understood. 
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Str and Otc on the 
physiology (assimilation, transpiration rate, intracellular CO2, and stomatal 
conductance to water vapor), rhizosphere bacterial assemblages (16S rRNA gene 
high-throughput amplicon sequencing), and rhizosphere metabolite profiles in 
healthy Citrus reticulata trees. The results indicated a reduction in 
photosynthesis after Str and Otc treatments, whereas CO2 outflow stayed 
constant. Both antibiotics decreased the culturable numbers of bacteria. 
Analysis of the microbiome showed changes in relative abundance of bacterial 
groups, specifically Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, and Streptomyces, in response 
to the antibiotics. Metabolite profiles changed in streptomycin- and 
oxytetracycline-treated citrus plants suggesting response to microbe targets or 
induction of stress responses. This study advances knowledge of 
antibiotic-driven effects on the rhizosphere microbiome, rhizosphere metabolome, 
and plant physiology, which is essential for managing plant diseases while 
safeguarding rhizosphere ecology and long-term plant health.

INTRODUCTION: Even in the absence of inflammation, persistent symptoms in 
patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are prevalent and worsen quality of life. We 
previously demonstrated enrichment in sulfidogenic microbes in quiescent Crohn's 
disease patients with (qCD + S) vs without persistent GI symptoms (qCD-S). Thus, 
we hypothesized that sulfur metabolic pathways would be enriched in stool while 
differentially abundant microbes would be associated with important sulfur 
metabolic pathways in qCD + S.
METHODS: We performed a multicenter observational study nested within SPARC IBD. 
Quiescent inflammation was defined by fecal calprotectin level < 150 mcg/g. 
Persistent symptoms were defined by CD-PRO2. Active CD (aCD) and non-IBD 
diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) were included as controls.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with qCD + S, 274 qCD-S, 21 aCD, and 40 IBS-D 
underwent paired shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic 
profiling. The fecal metabolome in qCD + S was significantly different relative 
to qCD-S and IBS-D but not aCD. Patients with qCD + S were enriched in 
sulfur-containing amino acid pathways, including cysteine and methionine, as 
well as serine, glycine, and threonine. Glutathione and nicotinate/nicotinamide 
pathways were also enriched in qCD + S relative to qCD-S, suggestive of 
mitochondrial dysfunction, a downstream target of H2S signaling. Multi-omic 
integration demonstrated that enriched microbes in qCD + S were associated with 
important sulfur metabolic pathways. Bacterial sulfur metabolic genes, including 
CTH, isfD, sarD, and asrC, were dysregulated in qCD + S. Finally, sulfur 
metabolites with and without sulfidogenic microbes showed good accuracy in 
predicting the presence of qCD + S.
DISCUSSION: Microbial-derived sulfur pathways and downstream mitochondrial 
function are perturbed in qCD + S, which implicate H2S signaling in the 
pathogenesis of this condition. Future studies will determine whether targeting 
H2S pathways results in improved quality of life in qCD + S.

Plain Language Summary: Microbial-derived sulfur pathways and downstream 
mitochondrial function are perturbed in quiescent Crohn’s disease patients with 
persistent GI symptoms, which implicate H2S signaling in the pathogenesis of 
this condition.

Gastric cancer remains a significant global health concern with poor prognosis. 
This study investigates the role of neutrophils in gastric cancer progression 
and their potential as prognostic indicators. Using multi-omics approaches, 
including Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), machine 
learning, and single-cell analysis, we identified neutrophil-associated gene 
signatures and developed a robust prognostic model. Our findings reveal distinct 
gastric cancer subtypes based on neutrophil-associated genes, with one subtype 
showing increased neutrophil infiltration and poorer prognosis. Single-cell 
analysis uncovered neutrophil-associated alterations in cell composition, gene 
expression profiles, and intercellular communication within the tumor 
microenvironment. Additionally, we explored the relationship between 
neutrophil-associated genes, microbiota composition, and alternative splicing 
events in gastric cancer. Furthermore, we identified QKI as a key regulator of 
alternative splicing and demonstrated its role in promoting malignant phenotypes 
and enhancing TGF-beta signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in 
gastric cancer cells by wet experiment. Lastly, the role of QKI in the 
association with drug resistance and the identification of specific agents for 
treating QKI-associated drug resistance were also explored. This comprehensive 
study provides novel insights into the complex interplay between neutrophils, 
the tumor microenvironment, microbiota, alternative splicing and gastric cancer 
progression, offering potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory disease outbreaks frequently occur in settings where 
individuals are in close contact, for example, schools and factories. However, 
the transmission patterns of oropharyngeal microbiota among healthy individuals 
living in clusters are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the 
respiratory tract bacteria distribution and transmission patterns among 
individuals in close contact.
METHODS: A total of 36 freshmen from Peking University Medical School 
participated in the study. We collected pharyngeal swabs on the first day of 
enrollment, 15, 30, and 60 days after cohabitation. DNA was extracted from the 
swabs and subjected to high-throughput sequencing to profile the microbial 
composition. Statistical analyses were performed to assess diversity and 
significance.
RESULTS: Neisseriaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Streptococcaceae were the most 
abundant bacterial families detected. Over time, changes were observed in the 
bacterial communities, with a tendency for increased similarity between 
dormitory room members. By day 60 of cohabitation, the bacterial communities 
appeared to be more similar compared to the baseline (prior to cohabitation). 
The transmission patterns included spreading with colonization, spreading 
without colonization, and non-spreading. Bacteria belonging to the core genera 
are most likely to spread and colonize easily.
CONCLUSION: The risk of healthy cohabitants acquiring respiratory pathogens 
through close contact may be overestimated in epidemiological studies. 
Therefore, monitoring the spread of core genera that are easily transmitted and 
colonized is crucial for effective prevention of respiratory pathogen 
transmission.

Phytochemicals are nonnutritive substances found in plant foods that contribute 
significantly to the flavor and color of foods. These substances are usually 
classified as polyphenols, terpenes, sulfur-containing compounds, 
nitrogen-containing compounds, and others. Numerous studies over the last 
decades have demonstrated these substances play an immeasurable role in 
physiological regulation, health care, and disease prevention through their 
actions in antioxidation, anti-inflammation, antiaging, antivirus, anticancer, 
antithrombosis, lipid profile regulation, cardiovascular protection, 
neuroprotection, immunity regulation, and improvement of metabolic functions. 
This article reviews the chemistry and biochemistry of phytochemicals, their 
classification and chemical structure, occurrence and biosynthesis in plants, 
and biological activities and implications for human health and various 
diseases. The discussions are focused on the most recent important advances in 
these phytochemical researches. In addition, some future research directions of 
phytochemicals are set forth regarding dose-response, their mechanism and 
targets, interactions with gut microbiota, and impact on human health and 
different stages of chronic diseases.

Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a common metabolic disease due to feeding 
high-concentrate (HC) diets to ruminants, especially dairy cows, in intensive 
farming system. Long term feeding HC diets commonly induce damages to hindgut 
barrier, leading to the translocation of harmful substances such as endotoxins 
(LPS) from lumen to blood, which results in a low-grade inflammation and stress 
response. Secondary bile acids (SBAs) play an important role in maintaining 
intestinal homeostasis. However, the function of SBAs on the intestinal 
epithelial barrier in SARA remains unclear. In this study, 15 growing goats were 
randomly divided into 3 groups, control group (30 % concentrate of dry matter, 
CON), SARA group (70 % concentrate of dry matter, SARA), and SARA+BAs group 
(70 % concentrate of dry matte, supplemented with 3 g/d/goat of BAs, SARA+BAs). 
The changes of mucosal permeability, gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) profile 
was measured in the colon. The results showed that compared to CON group, the 
level of plasma D-lactate and diamine oxidase activity (DAO) (P < 0.05) was 
elevated in SARA group, while BAs supplementation significantly decreased plasma 
DAO (P < 0.05). The thickness of colonic mucosa, goblet cells (GCs) number (P < 
0.01) and the abundance of MUC2 and occludin expression (P < 0.05) were 
significantly decreased in SARA group, while BAs supplementation markedly 
increased GCs number and improved mucosal barrier. BAs effectively reduced the 
content of LPS and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the colonic digesta (P < 
0.05). Furthermore, BAs ameliorated SARA-induced reduction of total BAs (P < 
0.001), primary BAs (P < 0.05), and conjugated BAs (P < 0.05) including 
taurocholic acid (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and taurodeoxycholic 
acid (TDCA), as well as significantly increased hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) and 
lithocholic acid (LCA) contents in colonic digesta. 16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis revealed that BAs decreased the abundance of Prevotella and Treponema, 
but increased the abundance of Akkermansia which was positively correlated with 
GCs number and MUC2 abundance. BAs supplementation improved the changes in the 
abundance of Roseburia, Negativibacillus, Lactobacillus, and 
unclassified_f_prevotellaceae, which were correlated with TCA, TCDCA, and TDCA 
levels. RNA-Seq results showed that, compared to SARA group, BAs activated the 
PPAR signaling pathway which was positively correlated with the number of GCs. 
In summary, BAs supplementation remodels the profiles of gut microbiota and 
metabolites, activates the PPAR signaling pathway, and eventually ameliorates 
intestinal mucosal barrier damage.

As a traditional drug-food homologous plant, Dendrobium officinale is widely 
recognized for its nutritional and medicinal value. Specifically, D. officinale 
polysaccharide (DOP) has garnered attention as a potential prebiotic for its 
protective effects on gut microbiota and the nervous system. However, the 
underlying mechanism by which DOP improves cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains unclear. This study intends to elucidate the beneficial 
effects of DOP on AD mice from the perspectives of metabolomics and the 
intestinal microbiome. The results showed that DOP significantly ameliorated 
cognitive dysfunction, attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage and Aβ plaque 
deposition, and restored intestinal barrier integrity in AD mice. The 
antibiotic-cocktail-induced germ-free mouse model confirmed that the 
neuroprotective effect of DOP was dependent on gut microbiota. Further 
investigations demonstrated that DOP influenced the composition of gut 
microbiota and restored its diversity. Additionally, DOP reshaped metabolic 
profile disorders in AD mice and increased the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 
content. Correlation analysis further highlighted that specific gut microbiota 
was associated with the metabolism of AD mice. In conclusion, this study sheds 
light on the positive impact of DOP in reshaping the gut microbiota and 
enhancing cognitive function, offering important perspectives for the possible 
advancement and utilization of DOP.

The gut microbiota has been implicated in onset and progression of ulcerative 
colitis (UC). Here, we assess potential causal involvement of the microbiota and 
-associated fecal water (FW) metabolome in altering key functional parameters of 
the colonic epithelium. Fecal samples were collected from N = 51 healthy 
controls (HC), N = 36 patients with active UC (UC-A), and N = 41 subjects in 
remission N = 41 (UC-R). Using in vitro incubation experiments, the FW 
metabolome's impact on butyrate oxidation rates/gene expression and cell death 
(cytotoxicity) of HT-29 cells, cytokine production by PBMC, and barrier 
integrity of Caco2 monolayers was evaluated. The FW metabolome from patients and 
individuals hosting the Bacteroides 2 (Bact2) enterotype (69% of UC-A, 31% of 
UC-R, 3% of HC), characterized by lower levels of median- and short-chain fatty 
acids and furan compounds, left butyrate oxidation rates unaltered but affected 
associated gene expression profiles. UC patients/Bact2-carriers' FW lowered PBMC 
IL-8 production and increased IL-1β production. Patients' FW increased 
cytotoxicity, associated with sulfide compound levels. Bact2 carriers' FW, 
displaying higher levels of bile acids, lowered barrier function upon incubation 
of monolayers. The FW metabolome of patients and individuals hosting a dysbiotic 
microbiota could contribute to the disruption of functional processes of the 
colonic epithelium as observed in UC.

Plain Language Summary: What is already known on this topic. The altered gut 
microbiota is implicated in the pathology of ulcerative colitis, potentially due 
to a mediating role of the associated fecal water metabolome.Colonocytes of 
patients with ulcerative colitis display altered butyrate oxidation rates, gut 
barrier function, and immune function in vivo.What this study adds. The gut 
microbiota in ulcerative colitis, characterized by an increased prevalence of 
the Bacteroides 2 (Bact2) enterotype, is associated with an altered metabolome 
comprising lower SCFA, MCFA, and furan concentrations and higher levels of bile 
acids.The UC-associated fecal metabolome alters butyrate oxidation gene 
expression and cytokine production in colonocytes in vitro. It reduces gut 
barrier function and results in higher cytotoxicity of fecal water.Changes in 
butyrate oxidation gene expression and immune function are associated both with 
disease and Bact2 carrier status. Gut barrier function mainly depends on Bact2 
status, while fecal water cytotoxicity reflects disease status.How this study 
might affect research, practice, or policy. This study demonstrates the impact 
of the altered fecal water metabolome in ulcerative colitis on functional 
parameters of the colonic epithelium.By disentangling effects of Bact2 and 
patient disease status, the study identifies modulation of the gut microbiota 
away from enterotype-defied dysbiosis as a potential strategy to increase 
barrier function.

Bile acids (BAs) undergo extensive microbial metabolism in the gut and exert 
hormone-like functions on physiological processes underlying metabolic risk. 
However, the extent to which gut BA profiles predict cardiometabolic risk and 
explain individual responses to dietary interventions in humans is still 
unclear. In the DIRECT-PLUS Trial, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of 284 
participants randomized into three groups: healthy dietary guidelines and two 
Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) groups. We longitudinally measured 44 fecal BAs 
using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the gut microbiome through 
shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and body adiposity and serum lipids at baseline, 
6, and 18 months. Fecal levels of 14 BAs, such as lithocholic acid and 
ursodeoxycholic acid, were prospectively associated with body mass index (BMI) 
and serum lipid profiles (false discovery rate [q]<0.05). Baseline fecal BA 
levels significantly modified the beneficial effects of the MedDiet; for 
example, BMI reduction induced by MedDiet interventions was more pronounced in 
individuals with lower 12-dehydrocholic acid levels (q-interaction <0.001). We 
confirmed that the gut microbiome is a major modifier of the secondary BA pool 
in humans. Furthermore, the association of fecal BAs with body adiposity and 
serum lipids varied significantly in individuals with different abundances of 
gut microbes carrying BA metabolism enzymes, e.g. several Ruminococcus spp. In 
summary, our study identifies novel predictive biomarkers for cardiometabolic 
risk and offers new mechanistic insights to guide personalized dietary 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Food allergies, particularly peanut (PN) allergies, are a growing 
concern, with fatal anaphylaxis incidents often reported. While palforzia is the 
sole FDA-approved drug for managing PN allergies, it is not universally 
effective.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential of Gynostemma 
pentaphyllum saponins (GpS) as a novel therapeutic agent for PN allergy through 
modulation of gut microbiota, addressing the limitations of current treatments.
METHODS: To elucidate the role of GpS on peanut allergy, we first built a 
PN-sensitized C57BL/6J model mice. Through comprehensive sequencing analysis, we 
identified Parabacteroides distasonis as a key bacterium triggering PN 
sensitization. Employing the same mouse model, GpS was evaluated for its effects 
on anaphylactic symptoms, serum immunoglobulin levels, and allergy-related 
biomarkers. 16S rRNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were applied to 
investigate the impact of GpS on the host's gut epithelium and microbiome.
RESULTS: GpS treatment effectively reduced anaphylactic symptoms in 
PN-sensitized mice, as shown by decreased IgG1, total IgE, and PN-specific IgE 
levels. It also modulated the immune response by suppressing proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-21) and chemokines (CCL5, CCL12, CCL17, CCL22), 
while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13). Fecal 
microbial transplant from GpS-treated Model mice to PN-sensitized mice displayed 
anti-peanut allergy effects. Additionally, the administration of GpS-enhanced 
bacteria (Clostridium aldenese or Lactobacillus murinus), alleviated 
anaphylactic symptoms and reduced serum allergy markers in PN-sensitized mice.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, we revealed the intestinal environment, signaling 
molecules, mucosal cytokines, and commensal microbial profiles in the 
peanut-sensitized mouse model. We further presented evidence for the protective 
effect of GpS against PN allergen sensitization by downregulating a series of 
food-allergy-associated biomarkers and cytokines via the modulation of gut 
bacteria. More importantly, supported by both in vitro and in vivo experiments, 
we demonstrated that the protective effect of GpS against PN-allergy is through 
the enhancement of two commensal bacteria, Clostridium aldenese, and 
Lactobacillus murinus.

Background/Objectives: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD) is a growing global health problem closely linked to dietary habits, 
particularly high fructose consumption. This study investigates the combined 
effects of fructose and common food preservatives (sodium benzoate, sodium 
nitrite, and potassium sorbate) on the development and progression of MASLD. 
Methods: We utilized a human microbiota-associated mouse model, administering 
10% fructose with or without preservatives for 11 weeks. Liver histology, 
hepatic gene expression (microarray analysis), biochemical markers, cytokine 
profiles, intestinal permeability, and gut microbiome composition (16S rRNA and 
Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing) were evaluated. Results: Fructose 
and potassium sorbate synergistically induced liver pathology characterized by 
increased steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. These histological changes were 
associated with elevated liver function markers and altered lipid profiles. The 
treatments also induced significant changes in both the bacterial and fungal 
communities and disrupted intestinal barrier function, leading to increased 
pro-inflammatory responses in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Liver gene expression 
analysis revealed a wide range of transcriptional changes induced by fructose 
and modulated by the preservative. Key genes involved in lipid metabolism, 
oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses were affected. Conclusions: Our 
findings highlight the complex interactions between dietary components, gut 
microbiota, and host metabolism in the development of MASLD. The study 
identifies potential risks associated with the combined consumption of fructose 
and preservatives, particularly potassium sorbate. Our data reveal new 
mechanisms that are involved in the development of MASLD and open up a new 
avenue for the prevention and treatment of MASLD through dietary interventions 
and the modulation of the microbiome.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition 
characterized by recurrent episodes and an unclear etiology. Given the 
limitations of current therapeutic options, which include suboptimal efficacy 
and significant side effects, there is a pressing need to explore novel 
treatments. Probiotics derived from diverse species have been identified as a 
promising approach for managing IBD, owing to their anti-inflammatory properties 
and their ability to regulate gut flora, among other beneficial effects.
METHODS: In this study, three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were 
isolated from the feces of the scavenger spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a 
scavenging mammal. Based on their capability to survive within and adhere to the 
gastrointestinal tract, along with their profile of antibiotic resistance, a 
high-quality strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) was selected and 
demonstrated to be safe for mice. Subsequently, the therapeutic efficacy of LA 
was evaluated using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of ulcerative 
colitis in mice.
RESULTS: The results indicated that LA restored the disease activity index and 
improved histopathological lesions in the model group. It also reduced 
inflammation and oxidative stress and significantly restored the expression of 
mucins and intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, Occludin). 
Furthermore, LA corrected the DSS-induced disruption of the intestinal flora, 
leading to a significant decrease in the prevalence of potentially harmful 
bacterial genera, such as Bacteroides, and an increase in beneficial bacterial 
genera, including Lactobacillus. In conclusion, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1, 
isolated from spotted hyena feces, has potential as a functional supplement for 
alleviating symptoms of IBD and regulating intestinal flora.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity management strategies such as caloric restriction, 
very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs), and meal replacements can lead to moderate 
short-term weight loss. However, many patients face significant challenges in 
maintaining these results. Personalized interventions, including behavioral 
counseling and physical activity, have been shown to improve long-term adherence 
and success. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the pivotal role of 
dietitians in enhancing patient outcomes through nutritional therapy. When 
combined with pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery, the focus shifts from mere 
weight loss to broader health improvements.
METHODS: This review explores the evolving role of dietitians in obesity 
management, advocating for a shift from a weight-centric approach to a more 
holistic model that prioritizes overall health gains. Key areas of interest 
include dietetic interventions' impact on metabolic health, cardiovascular 
function, gut microbiome balance, inflammation, and psychological well-being.
RESULTS: Dietetic interventions have been shown to provide significant health 
improvements beyond weight loss. These include enhanced metabolic and 
cardiovascular health, better gut microbiome balance, reduced inflammation, 
improved sleep quality, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. By 
focusing on non-scale victories such as improved insulin sensitivity, lipid 
profiles, and mental health, dietitians play a crucial role in driving long-term 
success in obesity management. These outcomes highlight the need to shift the 
focus from short-term weight loss to a more comprehensive view of health gains.
CONCLUSIONS: The role of dietitians in obesity management is expanding to 
encompass a more comprehensive and individualized approach. Moving beyond a 
focus on weight reduction, this paradigm promotes long-term, patient-centered 
strategies that address the multifactorial nature of obesity. By combining 
dietary changes with regular physical activity and behavioral support, 
dietitians can contribute to sustained health improvements, treating obesity as 
a chronic, complex disease.

This study investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) by examining the interplay between gut microbiota, 
epigenetics, and metabolic health. A cohort of 22 patients undergoing sleeve 
gastrectomy (SG) was analyzed for changes in gut microbial composition and DNA 
methylation profiles before and six months after surgery. Correlations between 
gut microbial abundance and clinical markers at baseline revealed that certain 
genera were associated with worse metabolic health and liver markers. Following 
SG, significant improvements were observed in the clinical, anthropometric, and 
biochemical parameters of the NAFLD patients. Although alpha-diversity indices 
(i.e., Chao1, Simpson, Shannon) did not show significant changes, beta-diversity 
analysis revealed a slight shift in microbial composition (PERMANOVA, p = 
0.036). Differential abundance analysis identified significant changes in 
specific bacterial taxa, including an increase in beneficial Lactobacillus 
species such as Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners and a decrease 
in harmful taxa like Erysipelotrichia. Additionally, DNA methylation analysis 
revealed 609 significant differentially methylated CpG sites between the 
baseline values and six months post-surgery, with notable enrichment in genes 
related to the autophagy pathway, such as IRS4 and ATG4B. The results highlight 
the individualized responses to bariatric surgery and underscore the potential 
for personalized treatment strategies. In conclusion, integrating gut microbiota 
and epigenetic factors into NAFLD management could enhance treatment outcomes, 
suggesting that future research should explore microbiome-targeted therapies and 
long-term follow-ups on liver health post-surgery.

Saliva is crucial in maintaining oral health; its composition reflects the 
body's physiological and diseased state. Among salivary components, 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) stand out for their broad antimicrobial activities 
and role in modulating the oral microbiota and innate immune response. Local and 
systemic diseases can affect the levels of AMPs in saliva, making them 
attractive biomarkers. However, the large variability in their concentrations 
hampers their use in diagnostics. Knowledge of the various factors influencing 
the profile of salivary AMPs is essential for their use as biomarkers. Here, we 
examine how lifestyle factors such as physical activity, dietary 
supplementation, tobacco smoking, and psychological stress impact salivary AMP 
levels. By understanding these sources of variability, we can take a step 
forward in using AMPs for diagnostics and prognostics and develop new tailored 
and preventative approaches.

Gut microbial dysbiosis, especially bacteriome, has been implicated in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, nonbacterial members of the gut microbiome in 
AD, such as the mycobiome, archaeome, and virome, are unexplored. Here, we 
perform higher-resolution shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples 
collected longitudinally from a mouse model of AD to investigate longitudinal 
and multi-kingdom gut microbiome profiling. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 
fecal samples from AD mice and healthy mice returns 41,222 bacterial, 414 
fungal, 1836 archaeal, and 1916 viral species across all time points. The 
ecological network pattern of the gut microbiome in AD mice is characterized by 
more complex bacterial-bacterial interactions and fungal-fungal interactions, as 
well as simpler archaeal-archaeal interactions and viral-viral interactions. The 
development of AD is accompanied by multi-kingdom shifts in the gut microbiome 
composition, as evidenced by the identification of 1177 differential bacterial, 
84 differential fungal, 59 differential archaeal, and 10 differential viral 
species between healthy and AD mice across all time points. In addition, the 
functional potential of the gut microbiome is partially altered in the 
development of AD. Collectively, our findings uncover longitudinal and 
multi-kingdom gut microbiome alterations in AD and provide a motivation for 
considering microbiome-based therapeutics during the prevention and treatment of 
AD.

IL-6 remains a key molecule of the cytokine storms characterizing COVID-19, 
exerting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Emerging research 
underscores the significance of IL-6 trans-signaling over classical signaling 
pathways, which has shifted the focus of therapeutic strategies. Additionally, 
the synergistic action of TNF-α and IFN-γ has been found to induce inflammatory 
cell death through PANoptosis, further amplifying the severity of cytokine 
storms. Long COVID-19 patients, as well as those with cytokine storms triggered 
by other conditions, exhibit distinct laboratory profiles, indicating the need 
for targeted approaches to diagnosis and management. Growing evidence also 
highlights the gut microbiota's crucial role in modulating the immune response 
during COVID-19 by affecting cytokine production, adding further complexity to 
the disease's immunological landscape. Targeted intervention strategies should 
focus on specific cytokine cutoffs, though accurate cytokine quantification 
remains a clinical challenge. Current treatment strategies are increasingly 
focused on inhibiting IL-6 trans-signaling, which offers promise for more 
precise therapeutic approaches to manage hyperinflammatory responses in 
COVID-19. In light of recent discoveries, this review summarizes key research 
findings on cytokine storms, particularly their role in COVID-19 and other 
inflammatory conditions. It explores emerging therapeutic strategies targeting 
cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, while also addressing open questions, 
such as the need for better biomarkers to detect and manage cytokine storms. 
Additionally, the review highlights ongoing challenges in developing targeted 
treatments that mitigate hyperinflammation without compromising immune function, 
emphasizing the importance of continued research in this field.

INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by 
diffuse lung injury. The impact of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) or emphysema on ARDS pathogenesis is not well characterized.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of ARDS patients enrolled in the Acute Lung Injury 
Registry and Biospecimen Repository at the University of Pittsburgh between June 
2012 and September 2021. Patients were categorized into two mutually exclusive 
groups by the prevalence of COPD or emphysema at the time of ARDS diagnosis. The 
COPD/emphysema group comprised ARDS patients with radiological evidence of 
emphysema, chart diagnosis of COPD, or both. Demographics, lung mechanics, and 
clinical outcomes were obtained from the electronic medical record. 
Host-response biomarkers known to have validated associations with ARDS were 
previously measured in plasma and lower respiratory tract samples using a 
customized Luminex assay. Continuous and categorical variables were compared 
between groups with and without COPD/emphysema.
RESULTS: 217 patients with ARDS were included in the study, 57 (27%) had 
COPD/emphysema. Patients with COPD/emphysema were older (median 62 
[interquartile range 55-69] versus 53 [41-64] years, p < 0.01), more likely to 
be male (62% vs. 44%, p = 0.02) and had a higher prevalence of congestive heart 
failure (25% vs. 4%, p < 0.01) compared to patients without COPD/emphysema. 
Baseline demographics, laboratory parameters, and mechanical ventilatory 
characteristics were otherwise similar between the two groups. No difference in 
90-day mortality was observed between groups; however, patients with 
COPD/emphysema had shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (median 10 
[7-18] versus 16 [9-28] days, p = 0.04) and shorter duration of mechanical 
ventilation (median 7 [4-16] vs. 12 [6-20] days, p = 0.01). Host response 
biomarkers in serum and lower respiratory tract samples did not significantly 
differ between groups.
CONCLUSION: ARDS patients with COPD or emphysema had similar respiratory 
mechanics, host response biomarker profiles, and mortality compared to those 
without COPD or emphysema but with a shorter median duration of mechanical 
ventilation and ICU length of stay. Future studies should address differences in 
clinical and biological responses by disease severity, and should investigate 
the impact of severity of COPD and emphysema on mechanical ventilation and 
targeted therapeutic strategies in ARDS.

The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing annually, but treatment 
option is limited. Fish collagen peptide (FCP) is a food source collagen peptide 
that has shown promise in alleviating UC symptoms. However, its impact on the 
intestinal barrier and intestinal metabolic homeostasis in UC remains unclear. 
This study aimed to analyze the peptide sequences and absolute amino acid (AA) 
content of FCP, assessing its effects on UC in mice induced by dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS). FCP was examined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The 3% DSS was utilized to induce UC in murine 
models, followed by the assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of FCP. Clinical 
manifestations of UC mice were meticulously evaluated and scored. Subsequently, 
samples were procured for histological examination and intestinal epithelial 
barrier integrity analysis as well as macrogenomic and metabolomic profiling. 
Here, it shows that abundant peptide sequences and AAs were in FCP, particularly 
enriched in hydrophobic AAs (HAAs). Furthermore, it was observed that FCP 
effectively reversed colon shortening and reduced the extent of histological 
damage. Additionally, FCP suppressed the abnormal expression of inflammatory 
factors and intestinal barrier proteins and modulated the dysbiosis of gut 
microbiota toward a balanced state. These alterations led to the activation of 
intestinal alkaline AA and various AA metabolisms, ultimately contributing to 
the mitigation of UC symptoms. In summary, the diverse peptide sequences and 
high AAs in FCP, particularly rich in HAAs, can alleviate DSS-induced UC via 
preserving intestinal barrier integrity, regulating gut microbiota, and 
modulating AA metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Discrimination is a recognized psychosocial stressor that has been 
linked to various negative health outcomes. This study explored the impact of 
discrimination on gut health, specifically focusing on microbiome changes, 
predicted metagenomic differences, transcriptomic profiles, and the potential 
for using a multi-omic approach to predict discrimination to identify 
discrimination status for an individual. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive 
investigation involving male and premenopausal female participants, using the 
Everyday Discrimination Scale to classify them into either high or low 
discrimination. Multiple questionnaires were administered to evaluate 
participants' physiological, psychological, and perceived stressors. Two diet 
questionnaires were also administered. Stool samples were collected for 
microbiome analysis and RNA sequencing. Microbial composition changes were 
analyzed using the Shannon index and Chao1 richness estimator for alpha 
diversity and the Aitchison distance metric for beta diversity. Differential 
abundance was evaluated using MaAsLin2, followed by metatranscriptomics 
sequencing and annotation. A multi-omic approach utilizing random forest was 
used to assess the predictability of discrimination.
RESULTS: The study results showed that high discrimination was linked to higher 
gut microbiome species richness (Chao1, p = 0.02) and significant beta diversity 
differences (p = 0.04). Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae were both less abundant 
in the high discrimination group. High discrimination participants also reported 
higher levels of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, early life adversity, 
visceral sensitivity, and neuroticism than those in the low discrimination 
group. Gene expression analysis revealed distinctive patterns, with significant 
changes in genes associated with environmental sensing (two-component system) 
and metabolic pathways. In a plot comparing gene transcription to DNA content, 
certain genes showed higher expression levels in participants who experienced 
both high and low levels of discrimination. Our random forest classifier 
demonstrated the capability to accurately differentiate individuals with high 
and low discrimination in our training cohort (AUC = 0.91).
CONCLUSION: These findings illuminate the substantial impact of discrimination 
on gut health, encompassing microbiome composition, gene expression, and 
functional pathways. These findings suggest that discrimination is associated 
with internal biological changes that can be associated with negative health 
outcomes, opening research to examine novel pathways that can be used to 
mitigate the negative health effects of discrimination.

Haematopinus suis is an obligatory ectoparasite of the domestic pig, serving as 
a vector of several swine pathogens and posing great threats to the pig 
industry. The gut microbiome of lice is thought of an important mediator of 
their healthy physiology. However, there is a great paucity of lice-associated 
microbial communities' structure and function. The current study aimed to 
profile the gut microbiome and to understand the microbial functions of swine 
lice by metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. In total, 102,358 
(77.2 %) nonredundant genes were cataloged, by contrast, only a small proportion 
of genes were assigned to microbial taxa and functional assemblages. Bacteria of 
known or potential public health significance such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, 
Chlamydia trachomatis, Waddlia chondrophila, Bacillus cereus, and Leptotrichia 
goodfellowii were observed in all samples. The integrated microbial profile 
further illustrated the evolutionary relevance of endosymbionts and detailed the 
functional composition, and findings suggested H. suis may acquire 
adenosylcobalamin by feeding due to an adenosylcobalamin synthesis defect and a 
lack of complete synthases of endosymbionts. Sucking lice contained fewer 
functional genes compared with ticks and fleas probably because of the obligate 
host specificity of parasitic lice. In addition, the genes from the intestines 
contained encompassed most of the microbial functional genes in sucking lice. A 
wide range of unknown taxonomic and functional assemblages were discovered, 
which improves our understanding related to microbial features and physiological 
activities of sucking lice. In general, this study increases the 
characterization of the microbiota of lice and offers clues for preventing and 
controlling lice infestation in swine production in the future.

Corynebacterium species are globally ubiquitous in human nasal microbiota across 
the lifespan. Moreover, nasal microbiota profiles typified by higher relative 
abundances of Corynebacterium are often positively associated with health. Among 
the most common human nasal Corynebacterium species are C. propinquum, C. 
pseudodiphtheriticum, C. accolens, and C. tuberculostearicum. To gain insight 
into the functions of these four species, we identified genomic, phylogenomic, 
and pangenomic properties and estimated the metabolic capabilities of 87 
distinct human nasal Corynebacterium strain genomes: 31 from Botswana and 56 
from the United States. C. pseudodiphtheriticum had geographically distinct 
clades consistent with localized strain circulation, whereas some strains from 
the other species had wide geographic distribution spanning Africa and North 
America. All species had similar genomic and pangenomic structures. Gene 
clusters assigned to all COG metabolic categories were overrepresented in the 
persistent versus accessory genome of each species indicating limited 
strain-level variability in metabolic capacity. Based on prevalence data, at 
least two Corynebacterium species likely coexist in the nasal microbiota of 82% 
of adults. So, it was surprising that core metabolic capabilities were highly 
conserved among the four species indicating limited species-level metabolic 
variation. Strikingly, strains in the U.S. clade of C. pseudodiphtheriticum 
lacked genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction present in most of the strains 
in the Botswana clade and in the other studied species, indicating a recent, 
geographically related loss of assimilatory sulfate reduction. Overall, the 
minimal species and strain variability in metabolic capacity implies coexisting 
strains might have limited ability to occupy distinct metabolic niches.
IMPORTANCE: Pangenomic analysis with estimation of functional capabilities 
facilitates our understanding of the full biologic diversity of bacterial 
species. We performed systematic genomic, phylogenomic, and pangenomic analyses 
with qualitative estimation of the metabolic capabilities of four common human 
nasal Corynebacterium species, along with focused experimental validations, 
generating a foundational resource. The prevalence of each species in human 
nasal microbiota is consistent with the common coexistence of at least two 
species. We identified a notably high level of metabolic conservation within and 
among species indicating limited options for species to occupy distinct 
metabolic niches, highlighting the importance of investigating interactions 
among nasal Corynebacterium species. Comparing strains from two continents, C. 
pseudodiphtheriticum had restricted geographic strain distribution characterized 
by an evolutionarily recent loss of assimilatory sulfate reduction in U.S. 
strains. Our findings contribute to understanding the functions of 
Corynebacterium within human nasal microbiota and to evaluating their potential 
for future use as biotherapeutics.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, with genetic and 
environmental factors contributing to its complex pathogenesis. Dysregulated 
immune responses and altered energetic metabolism are key features, with 
emerging evidence implicating the gut microbiota (GM) in disease progression. We 
investigated the interplay among genetic background, GM composition, metabolism, 
and immune response in two distinct ALS mouse models: 129Sv_G93A and 
C57Ola_G93A, representing rapid and slow disease progression, respectively.Using 
16 S rRNA sequencing and fecal metabolite analysis, we characterized the GM 
composition and metabolite profiles in non-transgenic (Ntg) and SOD1G93A mutant 
mice of both strains. Our results revealed strain-specific differences in GM 
composition and functions, particularly in the abundance of taxa belonging to 
Erysipelotrichaceae and the levels of short and medium-chain fatty acids in 
fecal samples. The SOD1 mutation induces significant shifts in GM colonization 
in both strains, with C57Ola_G93A mice showing changes resembling those in 
129 Sv mice, potentially affecting disease pathogenesis. ALS symptom progression 
does not significantly alter microbiota composition, suggesting 
stability.Additionally, we assessed systemic immunity and inflammatory responses 
revealing strain-specific differences in immune cell populations and cytokine 
levels.Our findings underscore the substantial influence of genetic background 
on GM composition, metabolism, and immune response in ALS mouse models. These 
strain-specific variations may contribute to differences in disease 
susceptibility and progression rates. Further elucidating the mechanisms 
underlying these interactions could offer novel insights into ALS pathogenesis 
and potential therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) 
asscociated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is becoming a growing concern in 
global healthcare. The early-life gut microbiota plays a crucial role in 
maintaining healthy. However, the impact of early-life gut microbiota dysbiosis 
on the advancement of MASLD-HCC remains inadequately understood.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the role of early-life gut 
microbiota in the development of MASLD-HCC in streptozotocin and high-fat diet 
(STZ-HFD) induced mouse model. We recorded the body weight and lifespan, and 
dynamically monitored the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (T-CHO) and blood 
glucose in the serum monthly. In addition, we examined various immune cells 
present in the liver, such as T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, αβT cells, 
γδT cells, macrophage and MDSC cells by flow cytometry and conducted liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based analysis on liver tissue from 
control and early-life antibiotic exposure mice (early-Abx) MASLD-HCC mice.
RESULTS: We found that early-Abx mice suffered from more severe tumor burden and 
further confirmed that hepatocytes and immune cells were all disturbed. 
Importantly, early-life antibiotic exposure alters the liver metabolic profiling 
especially glycerophospholipids and lipid accumulation. Furthermore, mice 
exposed to antibiotics in early-life showed disturbances in glucose metabolism 
and developed insulin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings revealed that early-life antibiotic 
exposure accelerated the progression of MASLD-HCC by impairing the hepatocytes, 
immune homeostasis and metabolites persistently, highlighting the importance of 
the early-life microbiota in the development of MASLD-HCC.

INTRODUCTION: The differential effects of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic 
formulations on human health are dictated by the inter-individual gut microbial 
profile. The effects of probiotics such as Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (ECN) on 
gut microbiota may vary according to the microbiome profiles of individuals and 
may be influenced by the presence of certain carbohydrates, which can impact 
microbial community structure and treatment results.
METHOD: Processed fecal samples from donors having contrasting lifestyles, 
dietary patterns, and disease histories were mixed with 5 × 106 CFU/mL ECN with 
or without 1% (w/v) sugars (glucose, galactose, or rice starch) in a host-free 
system. Post-incubation, 16 s rRNA sequencing was performed. Microbial diversity 
and taxonomic abundance were computed in relation to the probiotic, prebiotic, 
and synbiotic treatment effects and interpersonal microbiome variance.
RESULT: Baseline gut microbial profiles showed significant inter-individual 
variations. ECN treatment alone had a limited impact on the inter-personal gut 
microbial diversity and abundance. Prebiotics caused a substantial enrichment in 
Actinobacteria, but there were differences in the responses at the order and 
genus levels, with enrichment shown in Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and 
Megasphaera. Subject B exhibited enrichment in Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, 
but subject A showed more diversified taxonomic alterations as a consequence of 
the synbiotic treatments. Despite negligible difference in the α-diversity, 
probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic treatments independently resulted in 
distinct segregation in microbial communities at the β-diversity level. The core 
microbiota was altered only under prebiotic and synbiotic treatment. Significant 
correlations primarily for minor phyla were identified under prebiotic and 
synbiotic treatment.
CONCLUSION: The interindividual microbiome composition strongly influences the 
effectiveness of personalized diet and treatment plans. The responsiveness to 
dietary strategies varies according to individual microbiome profiles influenced 
by health, diet, and lifestyle. Therefore, tailored approaches that consider 
individual microbiome compositions are crucial for maximizing gut health and 
treatment results.

We investigated the efficiency of target-enriched long-read sequencing (TELSeq) 
for detecting antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements 
(MGEs) within complex matrices. We aimed to overcome limitations associated with 
traditional antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection methods, including 
short-read shotgun metagenomics, which can lack sensitivity, specificity, and 
the ability to provide detailed genomic context. By combining biotinylated 
probe-based enrichment with long-read sequencing, we facilitated the 
amplification and sequencing of ARGs, eliminating the need for bioinformatic 
reconstruction. Our experimental design included replicates of human fecal 
microbiota transplant material, bovine feces, pristine prairie soil, and a mock 
human gut microbial community, allowing us to examine variables including 
genomic DNA input and probe set composition. Our findings demonstrated that 
TELSeq markedly improves the detection rates of ARGs and MGEs compared to 
traditional sequencing methods, underlining its potential for accurate AMR 
monitoring. A key insight from our research is the importance of incorporating 
mobilome profiles to better predict the transferability of ARGs within microbial 
communities, prompting a recommendation for the use of combined ARG-MGE probe 
sets for future studies. We also reveal limitations for ARG detection from 
low-input workflows, and describe the next steps for ongoing protocol refinement 
to minimize technical variability and expand utility in clinical and public 
health settings. This effort is part of our broader commitment to advancing 
methodologies that address the global challenge of AMR.

OBJECTIVE: Many studies have reported microbial signatures in thrombi at major 
vascular sites, such as the coronary artery and the middle cerebral artery, 
which are critical for maintaining proper blood flow and oxygenation. Chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a condition involving 
non-resolving thrombosis that has not been fully studied. This study explored 
the microbial taxonomy and functional profiles of both fresh and organized 
thrombi associated with CTEPH to investigate the role of microbiota in thrombus 
non-resolving.
METHODS: In this study, 12 CTEPH fresh thrombi and 12 organized thrombi were 
collected from 14 patients with CTEPH. Metagenomic sequencing was employed to 
explore the genomic information of all microorganisms in the thrombus samples.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrated a diverse range of microorganisms in CTEPH 
thrombi, whether fresh or organized. Notably, a considerable proportion (54.7 %) 
of sequencing data could not be classified into the relative microbial taxa, 
highlighting the complexity and novelty of the thrombus ecosystem. Although 
there were no significant differences in microbial community structure between 
the two groups, the abundance of dominant microbial species varied. Leuconostoc 
sp. DORA 2, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aliidongia dinghuensis were common 
dominant species in CTEPH thrombus. Organized thrombus significantly increased 
the relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus, which was confirmed to 
effectively distinguish between organized and fresh thrombi by LeFSe analysis 
and random forest analysis. Functional annotation using both the KEGG and eggNOG 
databases revealed that organized thrombi exhibit stronger metabolic functions, 
particularly in amino acid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microbial composition and function may 
play an important role in thrombus organization. Targeting inflammation to 
prevent thrombosis presents promising opportunities for further research in this 
area.

Lymphocystis viral disease (LVD) is a highly transmissible disease known to 
affect multiple fishes worldwide. Although this disease is usually benign, 
mortalities can occur in cases where infection is severe or secondary infection 
with bacterial pathogens and parasites occur. However, little is known about the 
bacterial dynamics of fish with LVD or what bacterial pathogens may be 
responsible for secondary infections. Here we assessed the effects of LVD on the 
skin microbiome of gilthead seabream by comparing 30 symptomatic, asymptomatic 
and recovered (three weeks after infection) fish using 16S rRNA high-throughput 
sequencing. Our results show that LVD is associated with significant changes in 
microbiome structure and function. Importantly, fish pathogens like 
Tenacibaculum maritimum and some Vibrio species increased their abundance. 
Moreover, microbial metabolic activities of the commensal microbiota that may 
confer some protection to fish were suppressed in diseased fish. After reducing 
fish cage density to treat symptoms and three weeks of recovery, the abundance 
of pathogens was significantly reduced and microbiome functionality was 
recovered, although community structure remained significantly different. These 
results show that LVD can severely disrupt the bacterial communities of the skin 
of the gilthead seabream, leading to an increase in bacterial pathogens 
responsible for relevant diseases in gilthead seabream farms.

BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic oral mucosal inflammatory 
disease with a risk of becoming malignant. Emerging evidence suggests that 
microbial imbalance plays an important role in the development of OLP. However, 
the association between the oral microbiota and the metabolic features in OLP is 
still unclear.
METHODS: We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics profiling on 95 OLP 
patients and 105 healthy controls (HC).To study oral microbes and metabolic 
changes in OLP, we applied differential analysis, Spearman correlation analysis 
and four machine learning algoeithms.
RESULTS: The alpha and beta diversity both differed between OLP and HC. After 
adjustment for gender and age, we found an increase in the relative abundance of 
Pseudomonas, Aggregatibacter, Campylobacter, and Lautropia in OLP, while 18 
genera decreased in OLP. A total of 153 saliva metabolites distinguishing OLP 
from HC were identified. Notably, correlations were found between Oribacterium, 
specific lipid and amino acid metabolites, and OLP's clinical phenotype. 
Additionally, the combination of Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and (±)10-HDoHE 
effectively distinguished OLP from HC.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on multi-omics data, this study provides comprehensive 
evidence of a novel interplay between oral microbiome and metabolome in OLP 
pathogenesis using the oral microbiota and metabolites of OLP patients.

Chickpea is considered a rich source of nutrients, especially protein and 
dietary fibre. Besides, chickpea has potential benefits for the maintenance of 
gut health by improving intestinal integrity and serving as a source of energy 
for the gut microbiota. Moreover, chickpea consumption has been found to possess 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity. On undergoing certain 
treatments like soaking, dehulling, roasting, and germination, the 
anti-nutritional profile of chickpeas can be reduced. Observing these benefits, 
this review explores the impact of chickpea and its components on maintaining 
gut health, emphasizing various benefits. Besides, the paper comprehensively 
covers the nutritional composition of chickpeas and factors influencing the 
bioavailability of its components concerning gut health. Additionally, it 
outlines the mechanisms through which chickpeas influence gastrointestinal 
health, providing valuable insights into complex processes and potential 
therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the review identifies contributions that 
can guide future research, encouraging further exploration of chickpeas' role in 
gut health and the development of interventions. As a result of the presented 
review, chickpeas can be used as an affordable source of food, which is 
nutritionally stable and prevents gastrointestinal diseases.

The increasing prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections 
alongside tuberculosis (TB) underscores a pressing public health challenge. Yet, 
the mechanisms governing their infection within the lung remain poorly 
understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic sequencing, 
machine learning classifiers, SparCC, and MetOrigin methods to profile 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from NTM/TB patients. Our aim is to 
unravel the intricate interplay between lung microbial communities and 
NTM/Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our investigation reveals a 
discernible reduction in the compositional diversity of the lung microbiota and 
a diminished degree of mutual interaction concomitant with NTM/TB infections. 
Notably, NTM patients exhibit a distinct microbial community characterized by 
marked specialization and notable enrichment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Staphylococcus aureus, driving pronounced niche specialization for NTM 
infection. Simultaneously, these microbial shifts significantly disrupt 
tryptophan metabolism in NTM infection, leading to an elevation of kynurenine. 
Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, Mycobacterium 
abscessus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in the metabolic 
pathways associated with the conversion of indole to tryptophan via tryptophan 
synthase within NTM patients. Additionally, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase converts 
tryptophan into kynurenine, fostering an immunosuppressive milieu during NTM 
infection. This strategic modulation supports microbial persistence, enabling 
evasion from immune surveillance and perpetuating a protracted state of NTM 
infection. The elucidation of these nuanced microbial and metabolic dynamics 
provides a profound understanding of the intricate processes underlying NTM and 
TB infections, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and 
management.

BACKGROUND: Ticks are vectors of numerous pathogens, with their bacterial 
composition, abundance, diversity, and interaction influencing both their growth 
and disease transmission efficiency. Despite the abundance of ticks in Inner 
Mongolia, China, comprehensive data on their microbial communities are lacking. 
This study aims to analyze the microbial communities within ticks from Inner 
Mongolia to inform innovative control strategies for interrupting pathogen 
transmission.
METHODS: Tick samples were collected from animals and vegetation in multiple 
locations across Inner Mongolia and stored at - 80 °C. Ticks were identified 
using morphological keys and molecular biology methods. Full-length 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing was performed on collected samples. Bacterial community 
composition and diversity were mainly analyzed using bioinformatic tools such as 
QIIME, phyloseq, and DESeq2. Alpha diversity was assessed using Chao1, ACE, and 
Shannon indices, while beta diversity was evaluated using Bray-Curtis 
dissimilarity matrices. LEfSe analysis was applied to identify taxa associated 
with ecological and biological variables.
RESULTS: A total of 5,048,137 high-quality read counts were obtained, forming an 
average of 789.3 OTUs per sample. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes 
were the most dominant phyla. Bacterial community composition varied 
significantly with geography, with Dermacentor nuttalli showing a higher 
abundance of Rickettsia in Xilingol League, while other regions had different 
dominant genera. The microbial community also differed based on the feeding 
status of ticks. Additionally, the microbiota of engorged ticks showed organ 
specificity. Pathogen detection efforts revealed the presence of nine pathogens 
across all three tick species. D. nuttalli was found to carry a significantly 
higher burden of pathogenic bacteria, making it the most potentially threatening 
tick species in Inner Mongolia.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights significant variations in tick microbiomes 
influenced by geographic location, feeding status, and tick species. It 
underscores the importance of enhancing tick and tick-borne disease surveillance 
in Inner Mongolia for early detection and control of emerging pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk of colorectal 
cancer, and it has the potential to diminish the quality of life. Clinical and 
experimental evidence demonstrate protective aspects of parasitic helminth 
infection against IBD. However, studies on the inhibition of inflammation by 
helminth infection have overlooked a key determinant of health: the gut 
microbiota. Although infection with helminths induces alterations in the host 
microbiota composition, the potential influence and mechanism of helminth 
infections induced changes in the gut microbiota on the development of IBD has 
not yet been elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the intersection of helminth 
Trichinella spiralis and gut bacteria in the regulation of colitis and related 
mechanisms.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: T. spiralis infected mice were treated with 
antibiotics or cohoused with wild type mice, then challenged with dextran sodium 
sulfate (DSS)-colitis and disease severity, immune responses and goblet cells 
assessed. Gut bacteria composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. We found that protection against 
disease by infection with T. spiralis was abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and 
cohousing with T. spiralis- infected mice suppressed DSS-colitis in wild type 
mice. Bacterial community profiling revealed an increase in the abundance of the 
bacterial genus Muribaculum and unclassified_Muribaculaceae in mice with T. 
spiralis infection or mice cohoused with T. spiralis- infected mice. Metabolomic 
analysis demonstrated significantly increased propionic acid in feces from T. 
spiralis- infected mice. Data also showed that the gut microbiome modulated by 
T. spiralis exhibited enhanced goblet cell differentiation and elevated IL-10 
levels in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify the gut microbiome as a critical component 
of the anti- colitic effect of T. spiralis and gives beneficial insights into 
the processes by which helminth alleviates colitis.

BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a multifactorial disorder as its 
development may be based on several different pathophysiological mechanisms. 
Interaction of gut microbiome with the host has been proposed as a potential 
mechanism involved in the disease's pathogenesis.
AIM/METHODS: We aimed to characterize microbiome profiling on duodenal luminal 
content (DLC) of FD patients and compare it to that of controls (CG) and 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Outpatients fulfilling Rome IV 
criteria for FD, IBS, and control group (CG) underwent upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy and 2 cc of duodenal aspirate (3rd - 4th part) was aspirated in 
sterile traps. Duodenal microbiome was assessed after DNA extraction and 16S 
gene-based sequencing on Oxford Nanopore MinION followed by EPI2ME analysis 
(ONT/Metrich-ore Ltd). Bioanalysis of the microbiome (alpha-, beta-diversity, 
comparisons of relative abundances for all taxonomic ranks) was implemented in 
Python. Multiple group means comparisons were performed with one-way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test with Tuckey's and Dunn's post hoc tests 
respectively, in case of significance (P-value <0.05).
RESULTS: 20 subjects with FD (8 females; age 49.9 ± 13.5 yrs.), 20 with IBS (14 
females; age 57.6 ± 14.8 yrs.) and 10 CG (6 females; age 49.2 ± 13.8 yrs.) had 
their DLC analyzed. The α-diversity index of subjects with FD was significantly 
lower compared to controls (Shannon's index, p = 0.0218) and similar to that of 
patients with IBS. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) generated from species 
relative abundances (beta-diversity) showed no difference in the DLC profile of 
subjects with FD and IBS when compared to controls (p = 0.513). Compared to 
controls, the relative abundance (RA) of Chloroflexota phylum was lower in 
subjects with FD (p = 0.017) and IBS (p = 0.026), respectively. Additionally, 
the RA of the Rhodothermota and Thermotogota phyla was lower in FD (p = 0.017 
and p = 0.018, respectively) but not in IBS patients (p = 0.15 and p = 0.06, 
respectively) compared to controls. Interestingly, the RA of specific taxa from 
Chloroflexota, Rhodothermota and Thermotogota phyla were consistently lower in 
subjects with FD when compared to CG but similar to IBS, during analysis of all 
the subsequent major ranks of taxonomy. At the class level, there were 
significant differences in Syntrophobacteria, Acidithiobacillia, Cytophagia and 
Flavobacteriia between the FD and CG groups (p < 0.05), but no such difference 
between FD and IBS was found. Finally, multiple significant differences at the 
order, family, genus and species level between the FD and CG groups were also 
detected. A positive relationship between the RA of Streptococcus and those from 
genus Granulicatella was observed both in FD (p = 0.014) and IBS (p = 0.014) 
patients.
CONCLUSION & INFERENCES: The microbiome profiling from duodenal luminal content 
of FD patients is significantly different to that of controls, including lower 
microflora diversity, different microflora structure/composition and specific 
taxa. Similar differences in the DLC between FD and IBS patients were not 
evident.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Archaea are important components of the host microbiome, but 
their roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unclear. We aimed to 
elucidate the contribution of gut archaea to CRC across multiple populations.
METHODS: This study incorporated fecal metagenomic data from 10 independent 
cohorts from 7 countries and an additional in-house cohort, totaling 2101 
metagenomes (748 CRC, 471 adenoma, and 882 healthy controls (HC)). Taxonomic 
profiling was performed using Kraken2 against the Genome Taxonomy Database. 
Alterations of archaeal communities and their interactions with bacteria and 
methanogenic functions were analyzed. Random Forest model was used to identify 
multicohort diagnostic microbial biomarkers in CRC.
RESULTS: The overall archaeal alpha diversity shifted from HC, adenoma patients 
to CRC patients with Methanobacteriota phylum enriched while order 
Methanomassiliicoccales depleted. At the species level, Methanobrevibacter_A 
smithii and Methanobrevibacter_A sp002496065 were enriched, while 8 species, 
including Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanomassiliicoccus_A intestinalis, 
were depleted in CRC patients across multiple cohorts. Among them, M. stadmanae, 
Methanobrevibacter_A sp900314695 and Methanocorpusculum sp001940805 exhibited a 
progressive decrease in the HC-adenoma-CRC sequence. CRC-depleted methanogenic 
archaea exhibited enhanced co-occurring interactions with butyrate-producing 
bacteria. Consistently, methanogenesis-related genes and pathways were enriched 
in CRC patients. A model incorporating archaeal and bacterial biomarkers 
outperformed single-kingdom models in discriminating CRC patients from healthy 
individuals with AUC ranging from 0.744 to 0.931 in leave-one-cohort-out 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicohort analysis uncovered significant alterations in gut 
archaea and their interactions with bacteria in healthy individuals, adenoma 
patients and CRC patients. Archaeal biomarkers, combined with bacterial 
features, have potential as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.

Immune dysregulation is a key aspect of post-acute sequelae of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (PASC), also known as long COVID, with sustained activation of 
immune cells, T cell exhaustion, skewed B cell profiles, and disrupted immune 
communication thereby resulting in autoimmune-related complications. The gut is 
emerging as a critical link between microbiota, metabolism and overall 
dysfunction, potentially sharing similarities with other chronic fatigue 
conditions and PASC. Immunothrombosis and neurological signalling dysfunction 
emphasise the complex interplay between the immune system, blood clotting, and 
the central nervous system in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Clear research gaps in the design of PASC 
studies, especially in the context of longitudinal research, stand out as 
significant areas of concern.

BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (HF) patients have reduced microbiota 
diversity. Leakage of microbes and their metabolites into the bloodstream may 
activate neutrophils. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) consist of chromatin 
and proteases, and may contribute to HF pathogenesis. We assessed associations 
between circulating NETs and 1) cardiac function, 2) the degree of gut 
microbiota diversity and 3) gut leakage and microbial metabolites in HF 
patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 124 patients with chronic HF and left 
ventricular ejection fraction ≤40 %. Severe HF was defined as N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations above median. We measured 
citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), myeloperoxidase- and double-stranded-DNA in 
the blood. Gut leakage markers included bacterial lipopolysaccharides and 
soluble cluster of differentiation 14. The microbial metabolites included 
circulating trimethylamine N-oxide and butyrate producing capacity. We used the 
Shannon diversity-index and a dysbiosis-index based on bacteria with altered 
relative abundance to characterize the gut microbiota profile.
RESULTS: Quartile 4 of CitH3 was associated with more severe HF compared to 
quartiles 1-3, after adjustments for age, gender and hypertension (adjusted odds 
ratio [95 %CI] 3.21[1.18-8.69], p = 0.022). CitH3 was moderately associated with 
hypertension (p = 0.04), higher CRP levels (p = 0.016) and lower Shannon 
diversity index, (p = 0.039). No other NET marker associated with severe HF.
CONCLUSIONS: In chronic HF patients with reduced LVEF, high levels of CitH3 were 
associated with disease severity, inflammation and reduced gut microbiota 
diversity. Our results suggest that enhanced release of NETs could be involved 
in progressive HF, although the contribution of the gut microbiota seems limited 
in this context.

OBJECTIVES: Elevated circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been 
associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and MASLD. Nonetheless, BCAA 
supplementation has been shown to provide protective outcomes towards the 
intervention of MASLD. Currently, there is a lack of study towards the 
contribution of the BCAA: valine on MASLD. Herein, the effect of low-dose valine 
supplementation was investigated for its role in the progression of MASLD.
METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD) to induce 
MASLD. Upon the establishment of MASLD, valine was supplemented via voluntary 
oral administration. Clinical and biochemical parameters associated with MASLD 
were measured, and molecular mechanism and gut microbiota modulation from the 
effect of valine were investigated.
RESULTS: Low-dose valine was found to attenuate the progression of MASLD, 
significantly reducing the gain in body weight, liver weight, and epididymal 
white adipose tissue (eWAT) weight, while also attenuating hyperglycemia and 
hyperleptinemia, and improving serum lipid profiles. Mechanistically, in the 
liver, genes related to hepatic lipogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis were 
downregulated, while those associated with fatty acid oxidation, autophagy, and 
antioxidant capacity were upregulated, and AMPK pathway activity was enhanced. 
Liver and hypothalamic leptin resistance and inflammation were also attenuated, 
allowing better appetite control in mice fed a HFD and leading to reduced food 
intake. Additionally, metabolic flexibility in the eWAT was improved, and the 
gut microbiome was modulated by low-dose valine supplementation.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose valine supplementation attenuates MASLD by enhancing 
systemic leptin sensitivity and modulating the gut microbiome.

Although the association between gut dysbiosis (imbalance of the microbiota) in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is well-known, the simultaneous exploration 
in gut dysbiosis in fecal and different intestinal sections before and after 
lupus onset (at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months old) resulting from the loss of 
inhibitory Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcGIIb) and pristane induction have never been 
conducted. Anti-dsDNA (an important lupus autoantibody) and proteinuria 
developed as early as 6 months old in both models, with higher levels in FcGRIIb 
deficient (FcGRIIb-/-) mice. Compared to the healthy control at 2 and 4 months, 
the lupus mice (both FcGRRIIb-/- and pristane) and healthy mice at 6 months old 
demonstrated an alteration as indicated by the Shannon alpha diversity index, 
highlighting influences of lupus- and age-induced dysbiosis, respectively. 
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the fecal microbiota of 
FcGRIIb-/- mice were distinct from the age-matched healthy control at all 
timepoints (at 6 month, p < 0.05), while pristane mice showed divergence at only 
some timepoints. Analyses of different intestinal sections revealed similarity 
among microbiota in the cecum, colon, and feces, contrasting with those in the 
small intestines (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum). Subtle differences were found 
between FcGRIIb-/- and pristane mice in feces and the intestinal sections as 
assessed by several analyses, for examples, the similar or dissimilar distances 
(NMDS), the neighbor-joining clustering, and the potential metabolisms (KEGG 
pathway analysis). Due to the differences between the gut microbiota (feces and 
intestinal sections) in the lupus mice and the healthy control, rebalancing of 
the microbiota using rectal administration of feces from the healthy control 
(fecal transplantation; FMT) to 7-month-old FcGIIb-/- mice (the established 
lupus; positive anti-dsDNA and proteinuria) was performed. In comparison to 
FcGRIIb-/- mice without FMT, FMT mice (more effect on the female than the male 
mice) showed the lower anti-dsDNA levels with similar fecal microbiome diversity 
(16s DNA gene copy number) and microbiota patterns to the healthy control. In 
conclusion, gut microbiota (feces and intestinal sections) of lupus mice 
(FcGRIIb-/- and pristane) diverged from the control as early as 4-6 months old, 
correlating with lupus characteristics (anti-dsDNA and proteinuria). The 
different gut microbiota in FcGRIIb-/- and pristane suggested a possible 
different gut microbiota in lupus with various molecular causes. Furthermore, 
FMT appeared to mitigate gut dysbiosis and reduce anti-dsDNA, supporting the 
benefit of the rebalancing gut microbiota in lupus, with more studies are 
warranted.

Low-abundance members of microbial communities are difficult to study in their 
native habitats, including Escherichia coli, a minor but common inhabitant of 
the gastrointestinal tract, and key opportunistic pathogen of the urinary tract. 
While multi-omic analyses have detailed interactions between uropathogenic 
Escherichia coli (UPEC) and the bladder mediating urinary tract infection (UTI), 
little is known about UPEC in its pre-infection reservoir, the gastrointestinal 
tract, partly due to its low relative abundance (<1%). To sensitively explore 
the genomes and transcriptomes of diverse gut E. coli, we develop E. coli 
PanSelect, which uses probes designed to specifically capture E. coli's broad 
pangenome. We demonstrate its ability to enrich diverse E. coli by orders of 
magnitude, in a mock community and in human stool from a study investigating 
recurrent UTI (rUTI). Comparisons of transcriptomes between gut E. coli of women 
with and without history of rUTI suggest rUTI gut E. coli are responding to 
increased oxygen and nitrate, suggestive of mucosal inflammation, which may have 
implications for recurrent disease. E. coli PanSelect is well suited for 
investigations of in vivo E. coli biology in other low-abundance environments, 
and the framework described here has broad applicability to other diverse, 
low-abundance organisms.

Probiotics hold great potential for treating metabolic diseases such as obesity. 
Given the complex and multifactorial nature of these diseases, research on 
probiotic combination with multiple targets has become popular. Here, we choose 
four obesity-related targets to perform high-throughput screening, including 
pancreatic lipase activity, bile salt hydrolase activity, glucagon-like 
peptide-1 secretion and adipocyte differentiation. Then, we obtained 649 
multi-strain combinations with the requirement that each must cover all these 
targets in principle. After in vitro co-culture and in vivo co-colonization 
experiments, only four (<0.7%) combinations were selected as symbiotic probiotic 
communities (SPCs). Next, genome-scale metabolic model analysis revealed that 
these SPCs showed lower metabolic resource overlap and higher metabolic 
interaction potential involving amino acid metabolism (Ammonium, L-Lysine, etc.) 
and energy metabolism (Phosphate, etc.). Further animal experiments demonstrated 
that all SPCs exhibited a good safety profile and excellent effects in improving 
obesity and associated glucose metabolism disruptions and depression-like 
behaviors in high-fat-diet-fed mice. This anti-obesity improvement was achieved 
through reduced cholesterol level, fat accumulation and inhibited adipocyte 
differentiation. Taken together, our study provides a new perspective for 
designing multi-strain combinations, which may facilitate greater therapeutic 
effect on obesity and other complex diseases in the future.

Understanding the phyllomicrobiome dynamics in cauliflower plants holds 
significant promise for enhancing crop resilience against black rot disease, 
caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. In this study, the culturable 
microbiome and metagenomic profile of tolerant (BR-161) and susceptible (Pusa 
Sharad) cauliflower genotypes were investigated to elucidate microbial 
interactions associated with disease tolerance. Isolation of phyllospheric 
bacteria from asymptomatic and black rot disease symptomatic leaves of tolerant 
and susceptible cultivars yielded 46 diverse bacterial isolates. Molecular 
identification via 16S rRNA sequencing revealed differences in the diversity of 
microbial taxa between genotypes and health conditions. Metagenomic profiling 
using next-generation sequencing elucidated distinct microbial communities, with 
higher diversity observed in black rot disease symptomatic leaf of BR-161. Alpha 
and beta diversity indices highlighted differences in microbial community 
structure and composition between genotypes and health conditions. Taxonomic 
analysis revealed a core microbiome consisting of genera such as Xanthomonas, 
Psychrobacillus, Lactobacillus, and Pseudomonas across all the samples. 
Validation through microbiological methods confirmed the presence of these key 
genera. The findings provide novel insights into the phyllomicrobiome of black 
rot-tolerant and susceptible genotypes of cauliflower. Harnessing beneficial 
microbial communities identified in this study offers promising avenues for 
developing sustainable strategies to manage black rot disease and enhance 
cauliflower crop health and productivity.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is recognized as a systemic immune-mediated 
disease (IMID), sharing genetic and environmental risk factors with other IMIDs 
such as inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Over time, correlating 
clinical findings with genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic results has been 
challenging due to diverse sampling methods, analysis techniques, and the use of 
variable clinical phenotype descriptions across studies. This review aims to 
summarize the results from various omics fields to explore the etiopathology of 
HS. Genetic studies highlight defects in Notch and γ-secretase signaling and 
inflammasome function. Syndromic HS involves specific mutations in 
autoinflammatory syndromes such as pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma 
gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) and pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and HS (PASH). 
Proteomic analyses reveal key inflammatory pathways indicating activation of 
both innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, microbiome studies show an 
increased presence of anaerobes like Prevotella in HS lesions and a decreased 
presence of commensals such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gut microbiota 
dysbiosis, particularly involving Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium ramosum, 
is associated with HS. Moreover, metabolomic profiling indicates dysregulated 
tryptophan catabolism and lipid metabolism, with increased 
5-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites and odd-chain fatty acids suggesting 
bacterial involvement. In summary, despite advances, robust associations between 
genetics, proteomics, microbiome, and metabolomics in HS are still lacking. 
Integrating these datasets could identify new clinical phenotypes, genetic 
predispositions, microbial signatures, and therapeutic targets, enhancing 
personalized treatment strategies and biomarker discovery for HS classification, 
prognosis, and treatment response.

CONTEXT: The age-induced disruption of gut flora, termed gut dysbiosis, is 
intimately tied to compromised immune function, augmented oxidative stress and a 
spectrum of age-linked disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This review examines the fundamental mechanisms employed by probiotic 
strains to modulate gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles, mitigate 
cognitive decline via the gut-brain axis (GBA), modulate gene transcription and 
alleviate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.
CONCLUSION: We elucidate the capacity of probiotics as a precision intervention 
to restore gut microbiome homeostasis and alleviate age-related conditions, 
thereby offering a theoretical framework for probiotics to decelerate ageing, 
manage age-related diseases, and elevate quality of life.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by chronic inflammatory 
reactions in the central nervous system. Currently, little is known about the 
changes of plasma proteomic profiles in Chinese patients with MS (CpwMS) and its 
relationship with the altered profiles of multi-omics such as metabolomics and 
gut microbiome, as well as potential molecular networks that underlie the 
etiology of MS. To uncover the characteristics of proteomics landscape and 
potential multi-omics interaction networks in CpwMS, Plasma samples were 
collected from 22 CpwMS and 22 healthy controls (HCs) and analyzed using a 
Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach. Our results showed 
that the plasma proteomics pattern was significantly different in CpwMS compared 
to HCs. A total of 90 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), such as LAMP1 
and FCG2A, were identified in CpwMS plasma comparing to HCs. Furthermore, we 
also observed extensive and significant correlations between the altered 
proteomic profiles and the changes of metabolome, gut microbiome, as well as 
altered immunoinflammatory responses in MS-affected patients. For instance, the 
level of LAMP1 and ERN1 were significantly and positively correlated with the 
concentrations of metabolite L-glutamic acid and pro-inflammatory factor IL-17 
(Padj < 0.05). However, they were negatively correlated with the amounts of 
other metabolites such as L-tyrosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate, as well as the 
concentrations of IL-8 and MIP-1α. This study outlined the underlying 
multi-omics integrated mechanisms that might regulate peripheral 
immunoinflammatory responses and MS progression. These findings are potentially 
helpful for developing new assisting diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic 
strategies for MS.

The interactive pathway of the gut-liver axis underscores the significance of 
microbiome modulation in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver 
diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to 
investigate the disparities in the composition and functionality of the hepatic 
microbiota between tumor tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues, and their 
implications in the etiology of HCC. We conducted a comparative analysis of the 
hepatic microbiome between adjacent normal liver tissues and tumor tissues from 
HCC patients. Samples were categorized according to the modified Union for 
International Cancer Control (mUICC) staging system into Non-tumor, mUICC stage 
I, mUICC stage II, and mUICC stage III groups. Microbial richness and community 
composition were analyzed, and phylogenetic profiles were examined to identify 
significantly altered microbial taxa among the groups. Predicted metabolic 
pathways were analyzed using PICRUSt2. Our analysis did not reveal significant 
differences in microbial richness and community composition with the development 
of HCC. However, phylogenetic profiling identified significantly altered 
microbial taxa among the groups. Sphingobium, known for degrading 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exhibited a significantly negative correlation 
with clinical indices in HCC patients. Conversely, Sphingomonas, a gut bacterium 
associated with various liver diseases, showed a positive correlation. Predicted 
metabolic pathways suggested a correlation between atrazine degradation and 
valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis with mUICC stage and tumor size. 
Our results underscore the critical link between hepatic microbial composition 
and function and the HCC tumor stage, suggesting a potentially pivotal role in 
the development of HCC. These findings highlight the importance of targeting the 
hepatic microbiome for therapeutic strategies in HCC.

The global aging population has led to a rise in age-related health issues, such 
as malnutrition, metabolic disorders, and even immune decline. Among these 
concerns, periodontitis holds particular significance for the well-being of the 
elderly. This study aimed to investigate the impact of aging on inflammatory 
resorption of alveolar bone in mice with periodontitis, with a specific focus on 
alterations in the intestinal microenvironment. To achieve this, we established 
a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model with periodontitis and employed 
histopathological staining, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors analyses 
to assess the severity of periodontitis and the health status. Additionally, the 
16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were employed to 
investigate alterations in the intestinal microbiota and metabolites. Our 
results showed that D-gal-induced aging mice with periodontitis experienced more 
pronounced alveolar bone inflammatory resorption and disruptions in the gut 
barrier, accompanied by an overall decline in physical condition. The microbial 
composition and structure of aged mice also underwent significant modifications, 
with a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Furthermore, metabolomics 
analysis demonstrated that D-gal-induced aging primarily influenced lipids and 
lipid-like molecules metabolism, and enrichment observed in the rheumatoid 
arthritis and histidine metabolism pathways. These findings provide further 
evidence that the aging process exacerbates age-related alveolar bone loss (ABL) 
through disturbances in intestinal homeostasis.
