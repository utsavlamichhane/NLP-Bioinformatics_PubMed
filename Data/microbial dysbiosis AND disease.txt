Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is prevalent among patients with 
colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to explore the anticancer roles of the 
fecal microbiota in inhibiting the progression of colorectal cancer and possible 
mechanisms. The intestinal microbial dysbiosis in CRC mice was significantly 
ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as indicated by the 
restored ACE index and Shannon index. The diameter and number of cancerous foci 
were significantly decreased in CRC mice treated with FMT, along with the 
restoration of the intestinal mucosal structure and the lessening of the gland 
arrangement disorder. Key factors in oxidative stress (TXN1, TXNRD1, and 
HIF-1α); cell cycle regulators (IGF-1, BIRC5, CDK8, HDAC2, EGFR, and CTSL); and 
a critical transcription factor of the innate immune signal pathway (IRF5) were 
among the repressed oncogenic targets engaged in the FMT treatment of CRC. 
Correlation analysis revealed that their expressions were positively correlated 
with uncultured_bacterium_o_Mollicutes_RF39, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and 
negatively correlated with Bacillus, Marvinbryantia, Roseburia, Angelakisella, 
Enterorhabdus, Bacteroides, Muribaculum, and genera of 
uncultured_bacterium_f_Eggerthellaceae, 
uncultured_bacterium_f_Xanthobacteraceae, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001,

Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and 
uncultured_bacterium_f_Peptococcaceae. This study provides more evidence for the 
application of FMT in the clinical treatment of CRC.

Many systemic diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and cardiovascular disease, are associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The oral 
and intestinal microbiota are directly connected anatomically, and communicate 
with each other through the oral-gut microbiome axis to establish and maintain 
host microbial homeostasis. In addition to directly, periodontal bacteria may 
also be indirectly involved in the regulation of systemic health and disease 
through the disturbed gut. This paper provides evidence for the role of 
periodontal bacteria in systemic diseases via the oral-gut axis and the 
far-reaching implications of maintaining periodontal health in reducing the risk 
of many intestinal and parenteral diseases. This may provide insight into the 
underlying pathogenesis of many systemic diseases and the search for new 
preventive and therapeutic strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the subgingival microbiota in subjects with stage 
I/II periodontitis (moderate periodontitis, MP), stage III/IV periodontitis 
(severe periodontitis, SP), and periodontal health (PH) at the same probing 
depth (PD) (shallow ≤ 3 mm, moderate 4-6 mm, or deep ≥ 7 mm), and to investigate 
the changes associated with probing depth progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 
subjects (16 MP, 17 SP and 17 PH), forming six groups: PHS (PH, shallow), MPS 
(MP, shallow), MPM (MP, moderate), SPS (SP, shallow), SPM (SP, moderate), and 
SPD (SP, deep). Samples were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.
RESULT: The subgingival microbiome showed significant differences associated 
with both PD and periodontitis stage (p < 0.05). With increasing PD, alpha 
diversity initially increased and then decreased. Pathogenic genera like 
Fusobacterium, Filifactor, and Porphyromonas increased, while health-associated 
genera like Streptococcus and Haemophilus decreased. At shallow sites, the PHS, 
MPS, and SPS groups showed similar community structure. At moderate and deep 
sites, the SPM and SPD groups exhibited significant differences in community 
structure compared to the MPM group, with the SPM and SPD groups showing 
decreased abundances of Actinomyces and increased abundances of Treponema. The 
microbial co-networks in the SPD and SPM groups exhibited greater complexity and 
connectivity and were more resilient to random microbial or node removal.
CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiome shows strong associations with PD and 
periodontitis stage.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Once periodontitis progresses to stage III/IV, 
reconstructing a healthy subgingival microbiome may be challenging, emphasizing 
the importance of early prevention.

The skin and gut microbiota are crucial to amphibians. Triadimefon (TF), a 
widely used triazole fungicide, controls crop diseases and regulates growth, 
with uncertain effects on amphibian microbiota. Contamination, typically 
involving mixed chemicals at low concentrations, including cadmium (Cd) and TF, 
may detrimentally affect amphibian growth, survival, and microbiota health in 
both the skin and gut, but few research has examined these consequences. This 
research examines the impact of Cd and TF on Rana dybowskii tadpoles, focusing 
on survival, body mass, and microbiome changes over 28 days across four groups: 
control, Cd, TF, and Cd + TF groups. Results showed significant reductions in 
survival and body mass in Cd and TF-treated groups, with the combination group 
being the most affected. Microbiota analysis revealed significant dysbiosis in 
both gut and skin microbiomes under pollutant stress, with a marked microbiota 
and a shift in dominant microbial communities. Function prediction analysis 
based on the microbiome composition highlighted significant differences across 
various biological pathways, including metabolism, immune system, environmental 
adaptation, and disease resistance. These alterations suggest that pollutant 
exposure compromises the tadpoles' ability to maintain homeostasis and resist 
pathogens. In conclusion, this study reveals the detrimental effects of Cd and 
TF on the survival, growth, and microbiomes of R. dybowskii tadpoles, indicating 
significant environmental and health risks.

The relationship between the gut microbiome and ocular health has garnered 
increasing attention within the scientific community. Recent research has 
focused on the gut-eye axis, examining whether imbalances within the gut 
microbiome can influence the development, progression and severity of ocular 
diseases, including dry eye disease, uveitis, and glaucoma. Dysbiosis within the 
gut microbiome is linked to immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and 
epithelial barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to ocular pathology. 
This review synthesises current evidence on these associations, exploring how 
gut microbiome alterations drive disease mechanisms. Furthermore, it examines 
the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, including 
antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation, all 
of which aim to restore microbial balance and modulate immune responses. As the 
prevalence of these conditions continues to rise, a deeper understanding of the 
gut-eye axis may facilitate the development of novel, targeted therapies to 
address unmet needs in the management of ocular diseases.

For a long time, traditional medicine has acknowledged the gut's impact on 
general health. Contemporary science substantiates this association through 
investigations of the gut microbiota, the extensive community of microorganisms 
inhabiting our gastrointestinal system. These microscopic residents considerably 
improve digestive processes, nutritional absorption, immunological function, and 
pathogen defense. Nevertheless, a variety of gastrointestinal and 
extra-intestinal disorders can result from dysbiosis, an imbalance of the 
microbial composition of the gut microbiota. A groundbreaking discovery is the 
gut-brain axis, a complex communication network that links the enteric and 
central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication allows the brain 
to influence gut activities and vice versa, impacting mental health and mood 
disorders like anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota can influence this 
communication by creating neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids, among 
other biochemical processes. These factors may affect our mental state, our 
ability to regulate our emotions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis. This study aimed to explore the complex interrelationships between the 
brain and the gut microbiota. We also conducted a thorough examination of the 
existing understanding in the area of how microbiota affects social behaviors, 
including emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions. We also explored 
the potential of interventions that focus on the connection between the gut and 
the brain, such as using probiotics to treat diseases of the CNS. This research 
opens up new possibilities for addressing mental health and neurological 
conditions in an innovative manner.

Microbiome modulation is one of the novel strategies in medicine with the 
greatest future to improve the health of individuals and reduce the risk of 
different conditions, including metabolic, immune, inflammatory, and 
degenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Regarding the latter, many studies 
have reported the role of the gut microbiome in carcinogenesis, formation and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its response to different 
systemic therapies. Likewise, obesity, one of the most important risk factors 
for CRC, is also well known for its association with gut dysbiosis. Moreover, 
obesity and CRC display, apart from microbial dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, 
which participates in their pathogenesis. Although human and murine studies 
demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in regulating energy 
metabolism and CRC development, little is understood about the contribution of 
the microbiome to the development of obesity-associated CRC. Therefore, this 
systematic review explores the evidence for microbiome changes associated with 
these conditions and hypothesizes that this may contribute to the pathogenesis 
of obesity-related CRC. Two databases were searched, and different studies on 
the relationship among obesity, intestinal microbiota and CRC in clinical and 
preclinical models were selected. Data extraction was carried out by two 
reviewers independently, and 101 studies were finally considered. Findings 
indicate the existence of a risk association between obesity and CRC derived 
from metabolic, immune, and microbial disorders.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in regulating human 
physiology, with dysbiosis linked to various diseases, including heart failure 
(HF). HF is a complex syndrome with a significant global health impact, as its 
incidence doubles with each decade of life, and its prevalence peaks in 
individuals over 80 years. A bidirectional interaction exists between GM and HF, 
where alterations in gut health can worsen the disease's progression.
MAIN BODY: The "gut hypothesis of HF" suggests that HF-induced changes, such as 
reduced intestinal perfusion and altered gut motility, negatively impact GM 
composition, leading to increased intestinal permeability, the release of 
GM-derived metabolites into the bloodstream, and systemic inflammation. This 
process creates a vicious cycle that further deteriorates heart function. 
GM-derived metabolites, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), and secondary bile acids (BAs), can influence gene 
expression through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone 
modifications. These epigenetic changes may play a crucial role in mediating the 
effects of dysbiotic gut microbial metabolites, linking them to altered cardiac 
health and contributing to the progression of HF. This process is particularly 
relevant in older individuals, as the aging process itself has been associated 
with both dysbiosis and cumulative epigenetic alterations, intensifying the 
interplay between GM, epigenetic changes, and HF, and further increasing the 
risk of HF in the elderly.
CONCLUSION: Despite the growing body of evidence, the complex interplay between 
GM, epigenetic modifications, and HF remains poorly understood. The dynamic 
nature of epigenetics and GM, shaped by various factors such as age, diet, and 
lifestyle, presents significant challenges in elucidating the precise mechanisms 
underlying this complex relationship. Future research should prioritize 
innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. By identifying specific 
metabolite-induced epigenetic modifications and modulating the composition and 
function of GM, novel and personalized therapeutic strategies for the prevention 
and/or treatment of HF can be developed. Moreover, targeted research focusing 
specifically on older individuals is crucial for understanding the intricate 
connections between GM, epigenetics, and HF during aging.

Intestinal dysbiosis and the associated l-tryptophan metabolic disorder are 
pivotal in inflammatory bowel disease progression, leading to a compromised 
intestinal barrier integrity. Remedying the dysfunction in tryptophan metabolism 
has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Herein, we reprogram the 
tryptophan metabolism in situ by EcN-TRP@A/G, encapsulating the engineered 
probiotic, EcN-TRP, with enhanced tryptophan synthesis capacity, for sustained 
modulation, thereby restoring intestinal barrier function and microbial 
homeostasis. The pH-responsive dual-layered EcN-TRP@A/G microcapsule developed 
via high-voltage electrospraying and liquid interface self-assembly, preserved 
probiotic viability in the harsh gastrointestinal milieu, and facilitated 
targeted colon release. Bioluminescent tracking in mice reveals a 22.84-fold 
increase in EcN-TRP@A/G viability and distribution compared to naked EcN-TRP. 
Targeted metabolomics highlights EcN-TRP@A/G's modulation of the 
tryptophan-indole pathway. Oral administration of EcN-TRP@A/G sustained elevates 
indole metabolites, particularly indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic 
acid, in colon tissue for up to 7 days. In IBD mice, EcN-TRP@A/G improves 
intestinal permeability, reduces inflammation, and recovers the gut microbiome 
by enhancing beneficial bacteria abundance like Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and 
Anaerostipes while suppressing pathogenic strains like Escherichia-Shigella. Our 
findings offer a cost-effective approach, harnessing the probiotic metabolic 
potential in situ through engineered modifications for effective IBD treatment.

As a part of the human skin commensal bacterial community, Staphylococcus aureus 
contributes to the host's immune system education. Nevertheless, it is also 
considered as an opportunistic pathogen involved in cutaneous infections or skin 
pathologies, in particular atopic dermatitis. To switch to a pathogenic 
behavior, S. aureus uses regulatory mechanisms to collectively produce virulence 
factors. Deprivation of these factors has emerged as a promising way to prevent 
or treat Staphylococcal diseases in facilitating the role of the immune system, 
while preserving the protective one of the commensal communities. This study 
focuses on the anti-virulent effect of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 
I-modulia®, two natural products that have already proven their value in 
skincare. The anti-virulent capacity of DSS was first demonstrated by a 
dose-dependent inhibition of δ-toxin release, a virulence factor known to be a 
potent inducer of mast cell degranulation, on in vitro S. aureus cultures at 
high and low virulent states. A transcriptomic study was then implemented for a 
comprehensive overview of the anti-virulent impact. The results have shown the 
downregulation of many transcripts related to host immune evasion (scn, sbi), as 
well as exotoxins (α,γ-toxin) and adhesins production (map, emp), mostly under 
the control of SaeRS Two-Component System (TCS), one of the two major virulence 
regulators in S. aureus. Interestingly, genes related to secretion systems and 
the synthesis of exo-proteases were significantly downregulated when DSS was 
used in combination with I-modulia®. The repression of these genes was not 
previously observed and reflects a broader inhibitory action. We have also 
demonstrated that the inhibition of virulence factors didn't affect S. aureus 
viability. Our findings suggest that combining DSS and I-modulia® could be a 
promising therapeutic strategy to counteract microbial dysbiosis in the 
treatment of S. aureus skin pathologies in re-empowering the host's natural 
immune defenses.

The term "microbiome" refers to the collection of bacterial species that reside 
in the human body's tissues. Sometimes, it is used to refer to all microbial 
entities (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and others) which colonize the human body. 
It is now generally acknowledged that the microbiome plays a critical role in 
the host's physiological processes and general well-being. Changes in the 
structure and/or function of the microbiome (dysbiosis) are linked to the 
development of many diseases including cancer. The claim that because of their 
negatively charged membrane, cancer cells are more vulnerable to some bacteria 
than normal cells and that is how the link between these bacteria and cancer 
evolved has been refuted. Furthermore, the relationship between the microbiome 
and cancer is more evident in the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy. In 
this narrative review, we detailed the correlation between the presence/absence 
of specific bacterial species and the development, diagnosis, prognosis, and 
treatment of some types of cancer including colorectal, lung, breast, and 
prostate cancer. In addition, we discussed the mechanisms of microbiome-cancer 
interactions including genotoxin production, the role of free radicals, 
modification of signaling pathways in host cells, immune modulation, and 
modulation of drug metabolism by microbiome. Future directions and clinical 
application of microbiome in the early detection, prognosis, and treatment of 
cancer emphasizing on the role of fecal transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, 
and microbiome biomarkers were also considered.

Background. The growing interest in microbiota-epigenetics-immune system 
research stems from the understanding that microbiota, a group of 
micro-organisms colonized in the human body, can influence the gene expression 
through epigenetic mechanisms and interaction with the immune system. 
Epigenetics refers to changes in gene activity that are not caused by the 
alteration in the DNA sequence itself.Discussion. The clinical significance of 
this research lies in the potential to develop new therapies for diseases linked 
to the imbalance of these microbial species (dysbiosis), such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. The intricate interaction between microbiota and 
epigenetics involves the production of metabolites and signalling molecules that 
can impact our health by influencing immune responses, metabolism and 
inflammation. Understanding these interactions could lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies targeting microbiota-epigenetic pathways to improve health 
outcomes.Conclusion. In this context, we aim to review and emphasize the current 
knowledge and key concepts that link the microbiota to epigenetics and immune 
system function, exploring their relevance to the development and maintenance of 
homeostasis and susceptibility to different diseases later in life. We aim to 
elucidate key concepts concerning the interactions and potential effects among 
the human gut microbiota, epigenetics, the immune system and ageing diseases 
linked to dysbiosis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a persistent and complex condition 
accomplished by inflammation of the gastrointestinal system, encompassing 
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This condition is caused by 
the combination of genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and 
dysregulated immunological responses, which complicates diagnosis and treatment. 
The latest developments in gastroenterology have revealed the critical 
significance of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) are a type of microbial component that potentially regulate 
intestinal inflammation. The impact of microbiota-derived bacterial EVs (bEVs) 
on intestinal inflammation is mediated through several methods. They can 
intensify inflammation or stimulate defensive responses by delivering 
immunomodulatory cargo. Improved comprehension could enhance inventive 
diagnostic and treatment strategies for IBD. This study aimed to explore the 
relationship between microbiota-derived bEVs and the complex nature of IBD. We 
performed a thorough analysis of the formation, composition, mechanisms of 
action, diagnostic possibilities, therapeutic implications, and future prospects 
of these microbiota-derived bEVs.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating pulmonary disease with no 
curative treatment other than lung transplantation. IPF results from maladaptive 
responses to lung epithelial injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. Here, we show that deficiency in the innate immune receptor, toll-like 
receptor 5 (TLR5), is associated with IPF in humans and with increased 
susceptibility to epithelial injury and experimental fibrosis in mice, while 
activation of lung epithelial TLR5 through a synthetic flagellin analogue 
protects from experimental fibrosis. Mechanistically, epithelial TLR5 activation 
induces antimicrobial gene expression and ameliorates dysbiosis after lung 
injury. In contrast, TLR5 deficiency in mice and IPF patients is associated with 
lung dysbiosis. Elimination of the microbiome in mice through antibiotics 
abolishes the protective effect of TLR5 and reconstitution of the microbiome 
rescues the observed phenotype. In aggregate, TLR5 deficiency is associated with 
IPF and dysbiosis in humans and in the murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. 
Furthermore, TLR5 protects against pulmonary fibrosis in mice and this 
protection is mediated by effects on the microbiome.
ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY: Deficiency in the innate immune receptor TLR5 is a risk 
factor for pulmonary fibrosis, because TLR5 prevents microbial dysbiosis after 
lung injury.

Melatonin (MT) (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an indoleamine recognized 
primarily for its crucial role in regulating sleep through circadian rhythm 
modulation in humans and animals. Beyond its association with the pineal gland, 
it is synthesized in various tissues, functioning as a hormone, tissue factor, 
autocoid, paracoid, and antioxidant, impacting multiple organ systems, including 
the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms of extra-pineal MT production and 
its role in microbiota-host interactions remain less understood. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of MT, including its production, actions 
sites, metabolic pathways, and implications for human health. The 
gastrointestinal tract is highlighted as an additional source of MT, with an 
examination of its effects on the intestinal microbiota. This review explores 
whether the microbiota contributes to MT in the intestine, its relationship to 
food intake, and the implications for human health. Due to its impacts on the 
intestinal microbiota, MT may be a valuable therapeutic agent for various 
dysbiosis-associated conditions. Moreover, due to its influence on intestinal MT 
levels, the microbiota may be a possible therapeutic target for treating health 
disorders related to circadian rhythm dysregulation.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a 
significant global health issue, affecting over 30% of the population worldwide 
due to the rising prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This spectrum of liver disease ranges from isolated 
steatosis to more severe forms such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 
Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in MASLD pathogenesis, 
showing that dysbiosis significantly impacts metabolic health and the 
progression of liver disease. This review critically evaluates current 
microbiome-centered therapies in MASLD management, including prebiotics, 
probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and emerging 
therapies such as engineered bacteria and bacteriophage therapy. We explore the 
scientific rationale, clinical evidence, and potential mechanisms by which these 
interventions influence MASLD. The gut-liver axis is crucial in MASLD, with 
notable changes in microbiome composition linked to disease progression. For 
instance, specific microbial profiles and reduced alpha diversity are associated 
with MASLD severity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome could 
modulate disease progression by improving gut permeability, reducing 
endotoxin-producing bacteria, and altering bile acid metabolism. Although 
promising, these therapies require further research to fully understand their 
mechanisms and optimize their efficacy. This review integrates findings from 
clinical trials and experimental studies, providing a comprehensive overview of 
microbiome-centered therapies' potential in managing MASLD. Future research 
should focus on personalized strategies, utilizing microbiome features, blood 
metabolites, and customized dietary interventions to enhance the effectiveness 
of these therapies.

Alcohol intake causes many diseases including neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
nutritional deficiency, progressive pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and ischemic 
heart disease. The gut microbiota changes significantly after alcohol exposure. 
Alcohol consumption tends to increase in underage and young people, but the 
feature of the gut microbiota in puberty remains largely unexplored. In this 
study, we conducted alcohol-exposed pubertal and adult mice model to investigate 
the intestinal damage and gut microbiota change. Interestingly, the responses of 
pubertal mice and adult mice after alcohol exposure were different. We found 
that alcohol dehydrogenase decreased and aldehyde dehydrogenase increased in the 
liver of pubertal mice, thus reducing the accumulation of toxic acetaldehyde. 
Furthermore, alcohol exposure caused less intestinal injury in pubertal mice. 
Through the analysis of metagenome assembly genome, we obtained many 
unrecognized bacterial genomes. Limosillactobacillus reuteri (cluster_56) and 
Lactobacillus intestinalis (cluster_57) were assembled from the samples of 
pubertal mice, which were involved in the production of indole acetic acid and 
the transformation of bile acids in response to alcohol exposure. This study 
provided a new insight to investigate the gut microbiota change and explained 
the difference of the gut microbiota after alcohol exposure between pubertal 
mice and adult mice.
IMPORTANCE: This study elucidates the significant impact of alcohol exposure on 
the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways in mice, highlighting the differential 
responses between adolescent and adult stages. Alcohol exposure was found to 
damage the intestinal barrier, alter the microbial composition by decreasing 
beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus, and increase harmful bacteria such as 
Alistipes. The study also discovered unique microbial changes and resilience in 
pubertal mice. Species-level metagenomic analysis revealed specific microbial 
taxa and metabolic functions affected by alcohol. Metagenome-assembled genomes 
(MAGs) found many species that could not be annotated by conventional methods 
including many members of Lachnospiraceae, greatly expanding our understanding 
of the gut microbiota composition. These findings underscore the need for 
further research on alcohol's effects on various organs and the implications of 
microbial metabolites on disease progression.

This review explores the critical role of the human microbiome in neurological 
and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on gut-brain axis dysfunction caused 
by dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut bacteria. Dysbiosis has been linked to 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), and stroke. The gut microbiome influences the central nervous 
system (CNS) through signaling molecules, including short-chain fatty acids, 
neurotransmitters, and metabolites, impacting brain health and disease 
progression. Emerging therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), 
have shown promise in restoring microbial balance and alleviating neurological 
symptoms, especially in Alzheimer's and PD. Additionally, nutritional 
interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and specialized diets are being 
investigated for their ability to modify gut microbiota and improve patient 
outcomes. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota 
modulation but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to establish the 
safety and efficacy of these interventions in neurological and mental health 
disorders.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a malignancy with a high incidence and poor prognosis, 
significantly influenced by dysbiosis in the esophageal, oral, and gut 
microbiota. This review provides an overview of the roles of microbiota 
dysbiosis in EC pathogenesis, emphasizing their impact on tumor progression, 
drug efficacy, biomarker discovery, and therapeutic interventions. Lifestyle 
factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut use are major 
contributors to dysbiosis and EC development. Recent studies utilizing advanced 
sequencing have revealed complex interactions between microbiota dysbiosis and 
EC, with oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium 
nucleatum promoting inflammation and suppressing immune responses, thereby 
driving carcinogenesis. Altered esophageal microbiota, characterized by reduced 
beneficial bacteria and increased pathogenic species, further exacerbate local 
inflammation and tumor growth. Gut microbiota dysbiosis also affects systemic 
immunity, influencing chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, with certain 
bacteria enhancing or inhibiting treatment responses. Microbiota composition 
shows potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection, prognosis, and 
personalized therapy. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota-such 
as probiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation-offer 
promising avenues to restore balance and improve treatment efficacy, potentially 
enhancing patient outcomes. Integrating microbiome-focused strategies into 
current therapeutic frameworks could improve EC management, reduce adverse 
effects, and enhance patient survival. These findings highlight the need for 
further research into microbiota-tumor interactions and microbial interventions 
to transform EC treatment and prevention, particularly in cases of late-stage 
diagnosis and poor treatment response.

Shenyang, China.

Over the past few years, the correlation between periodontal disease (PD) and 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has attracted widespread attention owing to the 
increased incidence of these diseases. Several studies have suggested a possible 
link between the two. In this narrative review, we examined the epidemiology, 
common risk factors, and pathological mechanisms of PCOS and PD to investigate 
the potential association between these diseases. Evidence from the literature 
indicates that PCOS and PD can interact with each other. Common risk factors, 
such as microbial homeostasis imbalance owing to dysbiosis, along with multiple 
hormone and inflammatory mediators, as well as inflammatory responses owing to 
oxidative stress and oxidative responses owing to ferroptosis, are all 
associated with the pathogenesis of both diseases. Further studies are needed to 
clarify the specific mechanisms of interaction between PCOS and PD, which could 
clarify future directions in disease management and combined multidisciplinary 
treatment.

Recent advances in microbiome research have uncovered a dynamic and complex 
connection between the gut and lungs, known as the gut-lung axis. This 
bidirectional communication network plays a critical role in modulating immune 
responses and maintaining respiratory health. Mediated by immune interactions, 
metabolic byproducts, and microbial communities in both organs, this axis 
demonstrates how gut-derived signals, such as metabolites and immune modulators, 
can reach the lung tissue via systemic circulation, influencing respiratory 
function and disease susceptibility. To explore the implications of this 
connection, we conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2001 
and 2024 (with as much as nearly 60% covering the period 2020-2024), using 
keywords such as "gut-lung axis", "microbiome", "respiratory disease", and 
"immune signaling". Studies were selected based on their relevance to gut-lung 
communication mechanisms, the impact of dysbiosis, and the role of the gut 
microbiota in respiratory diseases. This review provides a comprehensive 
overview of the gut-lung microbiome axis, emphasizing its importance in 
regulating inflammatory and immune responses linked to respiratory health. 
Understanding this intricate pathway opens new avenues for microbiota-targeted 
therapeutic strategies, which could offer promising interventions for 
respiratory diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
even infections. The insights gained through this research underscore the 
potential of the gut-lung axis as a novel target for preventative and 
therapeutic approaches in respiratory medicine, with implications for enhancing 
both gut and lung health.

The intricate relationship between hydrogen sulfide (H2S), gut microbiota, and 
sirtuins (SIRTs) can be seen as a paradigm axis in maintaining cellular 
homeostasis, modulating oxidative stress, and promoting mitochondrial health, 
which together play a pivotal role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. H2S, 
a gasotransmitter synthesized endogenously and by specific gut microbiota, acts 
as a potent modulator of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, protecting 
against cellular damage. Through sulfate-reducing bacteria, gut microbiota 
influences systemic H2S levels, creating a link between gut health and metabolic 
processes. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in microbial populations, can alter H2S 
production, impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and 
heighten inflammation, all contributing factors in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, are 
NAD+-dependent deacetylases that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant 
defense, and inflammation. H2S enhances sirtuin activity through 
post-translational modifications, such as sulfhydration, which activate sirtuin 
pathways essential for mitigating oxidative damage, reducing inflammation, and 
promoting cellular longevity. SIRT1, for example, deacetylates NF-κB, reducing 
pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, while SIRT3 modulates key mitochondrial 
enzymes to improve energy metabolism and detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
This synergy between H2S and sirtuins is profoundly influenced by the gut 
microbiota, which modulates systemic H2S levels and, in turn, impacts sirtuin 
activation. The gut microbiota-H2S-sirtuin axis is also essential in regulating 
neuroinflammation, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Pharmacological interventions, including H2S donors 
and sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs), promise to improve these pathways 
synergistically, providing a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative 
conditions. This suggests that maintaining gut microbiota diversity and 
promoting optimal H2S levels can have far-reaching effects on brain health.

Background/Objectives: Evidence of the association between the gut microbiome 
and cardiovascular diseases has accumulated. An imbalance or dysbiosis of this 
system has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
events, including aortic diseases. We aimed to elucidate the findings of the gut 
microbial taxonomy associated with aortic diseases and their subtypes. 
Furthermore, we sought to investigate whether gut microbiome dysbiosis can be 
used as a biomarker for aortic disease detection and to identify which species 
can be disease-specific. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
guidelines for original research papers on gut microbiome composition in 
patients with aortic disease, using patients without aortic disease as the 
control (i.e., healthy controls). The databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and 
Web of Science were used by employing the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms 
"aortic diseases", "microbiome"," microbiota", and "taxa" before August 2024. We 
extracted the study characteristics, study population, and gut microbiome in 
aortic disease, including microbiota taxa diversity and abundance, regardless of 
taxa level. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool was 
used to assess study quality. Data were synthesized narratively to address the 
heterogeneity of the studies. Results: In this review, twelve studies that have 
identified gut microbial species and their potential impact on aortic disease 
pathogenesis were included. The studies showed the phyla dominance of Bacillota, 
Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota, and Euryarchaeota in aortic 
disease patients. We also included the taxa sequencing methods and those used to 
extract the microorganisms. Aortic diseases were categorized into Takayasu's 
arteritis, giant cell arteritis, aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection. Aortic 
disease patients had a higher rate of dysbiosis when compared to the healthy 
control groups, with significantly different microbiome composition. 
Conclusions: Patients with aortic disease exhibit a distinct difference between 
their gut microbiota composition and that of the healthy controls, which 
suggests a potential biomarker role of gut dysbiosis. Further exploration of the 
microbiome and its metagenome interface can help identify its role in aortic 
disease pathogenesis in depth, generating future therapeutic options. However, a 
unified methodology is required to identify potential microbial biomarkers in 
cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases.

Recent advances have highlighted the gut microbiota as a significant contributor 
to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which is an inflammatory 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) characterized by plaque buildup within arterial 
walls. The gut microbiota, consisting of a diverse collection of microorganisms, 
impacts the host's metabolism, immune responses, and lipid processing, all of 
which contribute to atherosclerosis. This review explores the complex mechanisms 
through which gut dysbiosis promotes atherogenesis. We emphasize the potential 
of integrating microbiota modulation with traditional cardiovascular care, 
offering a holistic approach to managing atherosclerosis. Important pathways 
involve the translocation of inflammatory microbial components, modulation of 
lipid metabolism through metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and 
the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence vascular 
health. Studies reveal distinct microbial profiles in atherosclerosis patients, 
with increased pathogenic bacteria (Megamonas, Veillonella, Streptococcus) and 
reduced anti-inflammatory genera (Bifidobacterium, Roseburia), highlighting the 
potential of these profiles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Probiotics 
are live microorganisms that have health benefits on the host. Prebiotics are 
non-digestible dietary fibers that stimulate the growth and activity of 
beneficial gut bacteria. Interventions targeting microbiota, such as probiotics, 
prebiotics, dietary modifications, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), 
present effective approaches for restoring microbial equilibrium and justifying 
cardiovascular risk. Future research should focus on longitudinal, multi-omics 
studies to clarify causal links and refine therapeutic applications.

The human gut is a complex ecosystem that supports billions of living species, 
including bacteria, viruses, archaea, phages, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes. 
Bacteria give genes and enzymes for microbial and host-produced compounds, 
establishing a symbiotic link between the external environment and the host at 
both the gut and systemic levels. The gut microbiome, which is primarily made up 
of commensal bacteria, is critical for maintaining the healthy host's immune 
system, aiding digestion, synthesizing essential nutrients, and protecting 
against pathogenic bacteria, as well as influencing endocrine, neural, humoral, 
and immunological functions and metabolic pathways. Qualitative, quantitative, 
and/or topographic shifts can alter the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis 
and microbial dysfunction, which can contribute to a variety of noncommunicable 
illnesses, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. While most 
evidence to date is observational and does not establish direct causation, 
ongoing clinical trials and advanced genomic techniques are steadily enhancing 
our understanding of these intricate interactions. This review will explore key 
aspects of the relationship between gut microbiota, eubiosis, and dysbiosis in 
human health and disease, highlighting emerging strategies for microbiome 
engineering as potential therapeutic approaches for various conditions.

Gut dysbiosis and an inflamed bowel are growing concerns in mammals, including 
dogs. Probiotic supplements have been used to restore the natural microbial 
community and improve gastrointestinal health. Biofilm formation, antimicrobial 
activities, and immunological responses of probiotics are crucial to improving 
gut health. Thus, we tested a commercial probiotic blend (LabMAX-3), a canine 
kibble additive comprising Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, 
and Enterococcus faecium for their ability to inactivate common enteric 
pathogens; their ability to form biofilms; epithelial cell adhesion; and their 
anti-inflammatory response in the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. 
Probiotic LabMAX-3 blend or individual isolates showed a strong inhibitory 
effect against Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic 
Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. LabMAX-3 formed biofilms comparable 
to Staphylococcus aureus. LabMAX-3 adhesion to the MDCK cell line (with or 
without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pretreatment) showed comparable adhesion and 
biofilm formation (p < 0.05) to L. casei ATCC 334 used as a control. LabMAX-3 
had no cytotoxic effects on the MDCK cell line during 1 h exposure. The 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) ratio of LabMAX-3, 
compared to the L. casei control, showed a significant increase (p < 0.05), 
indicating a more pronounced anti-inflammatory response. The data show that 
LabMAX-3, a canine kibble supplement, can improve gastrointestinal health.

This review explores the complex relationship between gut dysbiosis and 
hematological malignancies, focusing on graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. We 
discuss how alterations in microbial diversity and composition can influence 
disease development, progression, and treatment outcomes in blood cancers. The 
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota impacts these conditions are examined, 
including modulation of immune responses, production of metabolites, and effects 
on intestinal barrier function. Recent advances in microbiome-based therapies 
for treating and preventing GvHD are highlighted, with emphasis on full 
ecosystem standardized donor-derived products. Overall, this review underscores 
the growing importance of microbiome research in hematology-oncology and its 
potential to complement existing treatments and improve outcomes for thousands 
of patients worldwide.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of widespread morbidity and 
mortality. It has been found that the gut and oral microbiomes differ in 
individuals with CVDs compared to healthy individuals. Patients with CVDs often 
require long-term pharmacological interventions. While these medications have 
been extensively studied for their cardiovascular benefits, emerging research 
indicates that they may also impact the diversity and composition of the oral 
and gut microbiomes. However, our understanding of how these factors influence 
the compositions of the oral and gut microbiomes in individuals remains limited. 
Studies have shown that statins and beta-blockers, in particular, cause gut and 
oral microbial dysbiosis, impacting the metabolism and absorption of these 
medications. These alterations can lead to variations in drug responses, 
highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches. The microbiome's 
role in drug metabolism and the impact of CVD medications on the microbiome are 
crucial in understanding these variations. However, there are very few studies 
in this area, and not all medications have been studied, emphasizing the 
necessity for further research to conclusively establish cause-and-effect 
relationships and determine the clinical significance of these interactions. 
This review will provide evidence of how the oral and gut microbiomes in 
patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) interact with specific drugs used 
in CVD treatment.

A healthy ocular surface is inhabited by microorganisms that constitute the 
ocular microbiome. The core of the ocular microbiome is still a subject of 
debate. Numerous culture-dependent and gene sequencing studies have revealed the 
composition of the ocular microbiome. There was a confirmed correlation between 
the ocular microbiome and ocular surface homeostasis as well as between ocular 
dysbiosis and pathologies such as blepharitis, microbial keratitis, and 
conjunctivitis. However, the role of the ocular microbiome in the pathogenesis 
and treatment of ocular surface diseases remains unclear. This article reviews 
available data on the ocular microbiome and microbiota, their role in 
maintaining ocular homeostasis, and the impact of dysbiosis on several 
ophthalmic disorders. Moreover, we aimed to discuss potential treatment targets 
within the ocular microbiota.

Candida albicans are ubiquitous fungal organisms that colonize the oral cavity 
of healthy individuals without causing disease. C. albicans is an opportunistic 
microorganism with several virulent factors that influence the inflammatory 
process and allow it to invade tissues, evade host defense mechanisms, and 
release toxins, facilitating proliferation and degradation. At present, 
increasing emphasis is placed on polymicrobial interactions between C. albicans 
and various bacterial pathogens. Such interaction is mutually beneficial for 
both parties: it is competitive and antagonistic. Their complex interaction and 
colonization in the oral cavity serve as the basis for several oral diseases. 
The dispersion of C. albicans in saliva and the systemic circulation is noted in 
association with other bacterial populations, suggesting their virulence in 
causing disease. Hence, it is necessary to understand fungal-bacterial 
interactions for early detection and the development of novel therapeutic 
strategies to treat oral diseases. In this paper, we review the mutualistic 
interaction of C. albicans in oral biofilm formation and polymicrobial 
interactions in oral diseases. In addition, C. albicans virulence in causing 
biofilm-related oral diseases and its presence in saliva are discussed.

Obesity, a global public health problem, is constantly increasing, so the 
concerns in preventing and combating it are increasingly focused on the 
intestinal microbiota. It was found that the microbiota is different in lean 
people compared to obese individuals, but the exact mechanisms by which energy 
homeostasis is influenced are still incompletely known. Numerous studies show 
the involvement of certain bacterial species in promoting obesity and associated 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc. Our aim is to summarize 
the main findings regarding the influence of several factors such as lifestyle 
changes, including diet and bariatric surgery, on the diversity of the gut 
microbiota in obese individuals. The second purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the potential effect of various microbiota modulation techniques on 
ameliorating obesity and its comorbidities. A literature search was conducted 
using the PubMed database, identifying articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
Most studies identified suggest that obesity is generally associated with 
alterations of the gut microbiome such as decreased microbial diversity, an 
increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased SCFAs levels. Our 
findings also indicate that gut microbiota modulation techniques could represent 
a novel strategy in treating obesity and related metabolic diseases. Although 
some mechanisms (e.g., inflammation or hormonal regulation) are already 
considered a powerful connection between gut microbiota and obesity development, 
further research is needed to enhance the knowledge on this particular topic.

The gut microbiota, a diverse collection of microorganisms in the 
gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role in regulating metabolic, immune, 
and cognitive functions. Disruptions in the composition of these microbial 
communities, termed dysbiosis, have been linked to various neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDs), such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
One of the key pathological features of NDs is neuroinflammation, which involves 
the activation of microglia and peripheral immune cells. The gut microbiota 
modulates immune responses through the production of metabolites and 
interactions with immune cells, influencing the inflammatory processes within 
the central nervous system. This review explores the impact of gut dysbiosis on 
neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, immune cells, and 
potential therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota to alleviate 
neuroinflammatory processes in NDs.

Background. In many studies over the past decade, scientists have made a 
connection between the composition of gut microbiota and human health. A number 
of publications have shown that gut bacteria are involved in many metabolic and 
physiological processes of the organism. The composition of the gut microbiome 
is unique for each person and is formed under the influence of various factors 
associated with both the individual characteristics of the body and the 
characteristics of the environment. Different regional characteristics make it 
necessary for the body to adapt to certain conditions, including temperature 
fluctuations. Living in areas with low temperatures, such as the Arctic zone, 
dictates the need for increased energy consumption, which affects the 
composition of the gut microbiome. Methods. In our study, an extensive 
questionnaire was conducted among the participants, where many questions were 
included about the dietary preferences of the study participants, which allowed 
them us to further divide them into groups according to their diets. Stool 
samples were collected from participants from 3 groups: Arctic native, Arctic 
newcomer and the control group. The next step was the isolation of bacterial DNA 
and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The analysis of the results of the diversity 
of the intestinal microbiota was carried out both with and without taking into 
account the dietary preferences of the participants. Results. As a result of 
comparing the intestinal microbiota obtained from residents of the Arctic zone 
with the gut microbiota of residents of other regions with a milder climate, 
significant differences are found. These differences may be related to limited 
food resources and a reduction in the variety of food products characteristic of 
this Arctic region. t was also found that representatives of the bacterial 
families Christensenellaceae and Muribaculaceae dominated the control group, 
both with traditional nutrition and with a dairy-free diet in comparison with 
the Arctic groups. The control group was dominated by representatives of the 
Prevotellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae families compared to the 
Arctic group (with a traditional diet). The results also show that the number of 
representatives of the families Desulfovibrionaceae (with traditional diet) and 
Enterobacteriaceae (with milk-free diet) is growing in the Arctic group. 
Conclusions. In the course of this work, bacterial families characteristic of 
people living in the Arc-tic zone of the Far Eastern region of the Russian 
Federation were identified. Poor diet, difficult climatic conditions, and 
problems with logistics and medical care can have a strong impact on the health 
of this population. The main type of diet for the inhabitants of the Arctic is 
the traditional type of diet. They consume a large number of low-cost products, 
obtainget animal protein from poultry and canned food, and also eat a small 
number of fresh vegetables and fruits. Such a diet is due to the social status 
of the study participants and the climatic and geographical features of the 
region (difficulties in agriculture). With such a diet, we observe a decrease in 
representatives of the Christensenellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Eubacteriaceae, and 
Prevotellaceae families and an increase in representatives of the 
Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae families among Arctic residents. This 
imbalance in the futuremay cause, this population may to develop various 
diseases in the future, including chronic diseases such as obesity, intestinal 
dysbiosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

Virginia.

Over the last few decades, there have been tremendous advances in our 
understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in cirrhosis and the clinical 
sequelae that follows. Progressive dysbiosis and immune dysregulation occurs in 
patients with cirrhosis. In fact, alterations in the gut microbiome occur long 
before a diagnosis of cirrhosis is made. Understandably, our attention has 
recently been diverted towards potential modulators of the gut microbiome and 
the gut-liver axis as targets for treatment. The goal of this review is to 
highlight the utility of manipulating the gut microbiome with a focus on fecal 
microbiome transplantation (FMT) in patients with cirrhosis. In addition, we 
will provide an overview of disease-specific microbial alterations and the 
resultant impact this has on cirrhosis-related complications.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which comprise coronary heart disease, 
hypertension, and stroke, collectively represent the number one cause of death 
globally. Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors 
are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, 
hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, 
diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal 
haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota 
project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have 
indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human 
gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, 
have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal 
disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental 
studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients 
work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current 
evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human 
inflammatory disease. In detail, we summarise the impact of fish-derived 
proteins/peptides and algae components on CVD risk factors and gut microbiome. 
Furthermore, we describe the interplay among these dietary components, 
probiotics/prebiotics, and CVDs.

The oral microbiome, comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, is 
essential for maintaining both oral and systemic health. This complex ecosystem 
includes over 700 bacterial species, such as Streptococcus mutans, which 
contributes to dental caries through acid production that demineralizes tooth 
enamel. Fungi like Candida and pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are 
also significant, as they can lead to periodontal diseases through inflammation 
and destruction of tooth-supporting structures. Dysbiosis, or microbial 
imbalance, is a key factor in the development of these oral diseases. 
Understanding the composition and functions of the oral microbiome is vital for 
creating targeted therapies for these conditions. Additionally, the kynurenine 
pathway, which processes the amino acid tryptophan, plays a crucial role in 
immune regulation, neuroprotection, and inflammation. Oral bacteria can 
metabolize tryptophan, influencing the production of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 
and quinolinic acid, thereby affecting the kynurenine system. The balance of 
microbial species in the oral cavity can impact tryptophan levels and its 
metabolites. This narrative review aims to explore the relationship between the 
oral microbiome, oral diseases, and the kynurenine system in relation to certain 
systemic diseases.

Periodontal regeneration is a multifaceted therapeutic approach to restore the 
tooth-supporting structures lost due to periodontal diseases. This manuscript 
explores the intricate interactions between regenerative therapies and the oral 
microbiome, emphasizing the critical role of microbial balance in achieving 
long-term success. While guided tissue regeneration (GTR), bone grafting, and 
soft tissue grafting offer promising outcomes in terms of tissue regeneration, 
these procedures can inadvertently alter the oral microbial ecosystem, 
potentially leading to dysbiosis or pathogenic recolonization. Different 
grafting materials, including autografts, allografts, xenografts, and 
alloplasts, influence microbial shifts, with variations in the healing timeline 
and microbial stabilization. Biologics and antimicrobials, such as enamel matrix 
derivatives (EMD) and sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD), play a key role 
in promoting microbial homeostasis by supporting tissue repair and reducing 
pathogenic bacteria. Emerging strategies, such as enzyme-based therapies and 
antifouling materials, aim to disrupt biofilm formation and enhance the 
effectiveness of periodontal treatments. Understanding these microbial dynamics 
is essential for optimizing regenerative therapies and improving patient 
outcomes. The future of periodontal therapy lies in the development of advanced 
materials and strategies that not only restore lost tissues but also stabilize 
the oral microbiome, ultimately leading to long-term periodontal health.

Neurodegenerative diseases are severe, age-related conditions with complex 
etiologies that result in significant morbidity and mortality. The gut 
microbiome, a dynamic symbiotic environment comprising commensal organisms, 
represents the largest reservoir of these organisms within the human body. It 
produces short-chain fatty acids, endogenous signals, and neuroactive compounds, 
which can modulate neuronal function, plasticity, and behavior. Emerging 
evidence suggests that the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in 
neurodevelopment, aging, and brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Communication between the gut and brain occurs 
through a bidirectional channel known as the gut-microbiome-brain axis, which is 
being explored for therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders. This 
literature review was conducted through a comprehensive search of five 
electronic databases - PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Review, and Google 
Scholar - from inception to June 2024, focusing on English-language studies. 
Keywords included "gut-brain axis", "microbiome dysbiosis", "neurodegeneration", 
and disorder-specific terms such as "Alzheimer's disease" and "Parkinson's 
disease", paired with "gut microbiome". The review examines current knowledge on 
the relationship between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders, 
emphasizing potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. Results indicate that 
gut dysbiosis, characterized by microbial imbalance, is intricately associated 
with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis by influencing immune responses, 
increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, and generating neurotoxic 
metabolites. Therapeutic approaches targeting the gut microbiome, including 
probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, show promise in 
restoring microbial balance and slowing disease progression. However, further 
research is essential to validate these findings and develop effective clinical 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Over the past years, there has been a significant increase in the 
incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infections, particularly among pediatric 
patients, nationwide. An emerging body of research has established a link 
between dysbiosis of the host microbiome and the metabolic functioning of the 
host, which contributes to the development of respiratory diseases.
METHODS: A total of 25 children were included in the study, comprising 15 
pneumonia patients and 10 healthy children. Stool samples were collected from 
all participants to analyze the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, while serum 
samples were prepared for untargeted metabolomics to qualitatively and 
quantitatively assess short-chain fatty acids.
RESULTS: The gut microbial composition of individuals with Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
pneumonia (MPP) exhibited significant differences compared to healthy children. 
Notably, diseased children demonstrated higher microbial diversity and an 
enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, such as Erysipelatoclostridium and 
Eggerthella. Analysis revealed elevated levels of two specific short-chain fatty 
acids, namely acetic acid and isobutyric acid, in the MPP group, suggesting 
their potential as biomarkers for predicting MP infection. Metabolomic signature 
analysis identified a significant increase in major classes of 
glycerophospholipids in the MPP group. Moreover, we identified a total of 750 
significant correlations between gut microbiota and circulating serum 
metabolites. MPP enriched genera Erysipelatoclostridium and Eggerthella, 
exhibited negative associations with indole-3-butyric acid. Additionally, 
Eggerthella showed a positive correlation with inflammatory metabolites LPC 
(18:0).
DISCUSSION: Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the 
selection of potential biomarkers and the pathogenesis of MPP in children based 
on the gut microbiota and systemic circulating metabolites.

Lung cancer (LC) continues to pose the highest mortality and exhibits a common 
prevalence among all types of cancer. The genetic interaction between human 
eukaryotes and microbial cells plays a vital role in orchestrating every 
physiological activity of the host. The dynamic crosstalk between gut and lung 
microbiomes and the gut-lung axis communication network has been widely accepted 
as promising factors influencing LC progression. The advent of the 16s rDNA 
sequencing technique has opened new horizons for elucidating the lung microbiome 
and its potential pathophysiological role in LC and other infectious lung 
diseases using a molecular approach. Numerous studies have reported the direct 
involvement of the host microbiome in lung tumorigenesis processes and their 
impact on current treatment strategies such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or 
immunotherapy. The genetic and metabolomic cross-interaction, 
microbiome-dependent host immune modulation, and the close association between 
microbiota composition and treatment outcomes strongly suggest that designing 
microbiome-based treatment strategies and investigating new molecules targeting 
the common holobiome could offer potential alternatives to develop effective 
therapeutic principles for LC treatment. This review aims to highlight the 
interaction between the host and microbiome in LC progression and the 
possibility of manipulating altered microbiome ecology as therapeutic targets.

The human microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing 
disease; however, the effects of occupational exposure on the microbiota of 
aircrew and astronauts are not fully understood. This narrative review aims to 
synthesize the current knowledge on microbiota alterations in aerospace 
medicine, assess the potential of probiotics as a countermeasure, and identify 
key gaps that warrant further research. The references were identified through 
searching PubMed for English articles published between 2010 and 2024, using 
keywords related to microbiota, probiotics, aviation, spaceflight, pilots, and 
astronauts. Additionally, the bibliographies of relevant papers were reviewed. 
Studies in aerospace medicine were selected based on their focus on the 
occupational impact on microbiota and the use of probiotics in this context. For 
aircrew, initial studies indicate a decrease in beneficial gut bacteria, 
suggesting that probiotics could enhance gastrointestinal health, immunity, and 
overall well-being. However, unsupervised use of probiotics carries potential 
risks. Conversely, spaceflight induces significant changes in the gut, skin, 
oral, and nasal microbiota of astronauts, characterized by altered diversity and 
abundance of specific microbial taxa. These changes include a relative decrease 
in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, an increase in opportunistic 
pathogens, and evidence of microbial transfer between astronauts and spacecraft 
surfaces. While simulated space studies suggest the potential for probiotics to 
mitigate dysbiosis, direct testing done during actual spaceflight is lacking. 
The observed microbiota changes during spaceflight are associated with various 
health implications, including alterations in metabolic pathways and 
interactions between the microbial metabolic capabilities and the host's 
metabolism. In conclusion, this review highlights the profound impact of 
spaceflight on astronaut microbiota and the promising role of probiotics as an 
intervention in both space and aviation medicine. However, significant research 
gaps remain. These include elucidating the functional implications of microbial 
shifts, developing personalized countermeasures, and validating the efficacy of 
probiotics during spaceflight. Future studies should leverage advanced tools 
such as metagenomic analysis and longitudinal tracking of astronaut health to 
inform targeted interventions that support the well-being of aerospace 
personnel. Integrating data across different sites of the body and missions, 
facilitated by resources like the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), can help 
identify consistent microbial changes induced by the unique occupational 
conditions of spaceflight and aviation. This integrated approach will be crucial 
for developing effective microbiota-based countermeasures to mitigate the 
occupational health risks associated with space and aviation.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex chronic inflammatory 
condition characterized by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and dysregulation of 
immune system. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from 
mesenchymal stem cells have garnered significant attention for their beneficial 
potentials in immune modulation and tissue repair. This study aims to evaluate 
the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of EVs derived from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-pretreated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in 
mice with colitis.
METHODS: A mouse model of colitis was established using 3.0% dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS). Following the induction of colitis, mice were treated via tail 
vein injection with either conventional PDLSC-derived EVs (P-EVs) or 
LPS-pretreated PDLSC-derived EVs (LPS pre-EVs). The EVs were characterized using 
transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western 
blot analysis. The therapeutic effects and mechanisms were evaluated through a 
combination of small animal live imaging, disease activity index (DAI) scoring, 
histopathological staining, qRT-PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and mass 
spectrometry analysis.
RESULTS: The LPS pre-EVs exhibited typical EVs characteristics in terms of 
morphology, particle size distribution, and marker protein expression. Compared 
to P-EVs, LPS pre-EVs significantly ameliorated weight loss, DAI scores, colon 
length, and perianal symptoms in DSS-induced murine colitis. Additionally, LPS 
pre-EVs up-regulated the expression of Arginase-1, a typical M2 macrophage 
marker, and tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1, 
enhanced gut microbial diversity, and significantly regulated intestinal protein 
expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: LPS pre-EVs exhibit significant anti-inflammatory and tissue repair 
effects in a mouse model of colitis. The underlying mechanisms may involve the 
regulation of macrophage polarization, maintenance of intestinal barrier 
function, modulation of the gut microbiota, and activation of the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway.

Microbiome is a highly complex and diverse symbiotic component that undergoes 
dynamic changes with the organismal aging. Microbial perturbations, termed 
dysbiosis, exert strong influence on dysregulating the bone marrow niche and 
subsequently promoting the aging of hematopoietic and immune system. Besides, 
accumulating studies have revealed the substantial impact of intestinal 
microbiome on the initiation and progression of age-related hematologic 
alteration and diseases, such as clonal hematopoiesis and blood cancers. Current 
therapeutic approaches to restore the altered microbiome diversity target 
specific pathobionts and are demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes of 
anti-hematologic malignancy treatments. In this review, we discuss the interplay 
between the microbiome and the hemato-immune system during aging process. We 
also shed light on the emerging therapeutic strategies to tackle the dysbiosis 
for amelioration of aging and disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: Effect of gut dysbiosis on fatty acid (FA) linked 3β-hydroxy-bile 
acid esters (FA-isoBAs) formation is currently unknown. This study aimed to 
investigate the profile of FA-isoBAs in fecal samples from pediatric patients 
with ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from seven pediatric patients diagnosed 
with UC and seven age-matched healthy controls. Liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was set up for quantifications of thirteen 
different FA-isoBAs, including three new FA-isoBAs which had never been 
characterized. Method validation tests were performed with optimization of 
sample preparation. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare FA-isoBA 
concentrations between UC patients and healthy controls.
RESULTS: The LC/MS method had sufficient linearity (r > 0.998), with the low 
detection limit (0.03-2.82 nmol/g stool), and limits of quantification 
(0.10-9.40 nmol/g stool) for all FA-isoBAs. The total FA-isoBAs concentration in 
UC patients was significantly lower than healthy controls, regardless of the 
degree of the disease severity. The UC subjects had markedly increased primary 
bile acid (BA) levels with decreased secondary BAs. Propionic acid-linked isoBA 
and stearic acid-linked 12-oxo-isolithocholic acid were newly identified from 
healthy subjects but they were not present in UC subjects. In agreement with the 
previous report, composition of long-chain (C16-C18) FA-linked BAs dominated 
over short-chain FA-linked BAs both in healthy and disease subjects.
CONCLUSION: The present study reported the fecal FA-isoBA profiles in pediatric 
UC patients for the first time. The results open the door to the new field that 
investigates the role of these microbial-driven BAs in gastrointestinal health.

The gut microbiota is a highly complex microbial community residing in the 
digestive tract of humans and animals, closely linked to host health. Dysbiosis 
within the gut microbiota has been associated with various diseases. Moreover, 
it interacts with the female reproductive system's microbiota, influencing 
maternal reproductive homeostasis. Although the gut microbiota holds potential 
for treating reproductive system diseases and modulating offspring fertility, 
research in this domain remains limited. This review examines the relationship 
between both balanced and imbalanced gut microbiota and reproductive system 
diseases, as well as their effects on fetal development. It is highlighted that 
dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may contribute to several reproductive 
conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), preeclampsia (PE), 
endometriosis, gestational diabetes, and reproductive cancers. The abundance of 
specific gut microbial species or interactions among various species can 
influence the reproductive system through hormonal pathways and other 
mechanisms, ultimately affecting pregnancy outcomes and fetal health. Therefore, 
the concept of the gut-reproductive axis is proposed, emphasizing the 
significant role of maternal gut microbiota in shaping fetal development, 
metabolic capacity, and immunity.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a fast-emerging global burden, is an 
umbrella term for several liver manifestations that result in excessive 
accumulation of fat in the liver. NAFLD leads to gut microbiome dysbiosis, loss 
in gut epithelia, increased gut permeability, etc. The limited availability of 
registered drugs for NAFLD highlights the urgent need to focus on understanding 
its pathogenesis and discovering new treatments, including the potential 
exploration of herbal therapies for managing the condition. In this study, we 
evaluated the bioactive potential of garcinol enriched fraction from Garcinia 
morella fruit rind in preventing NAFLD-associated increased gut permeability. 
Administration of garcinol-enriched fraction (GEF) significantly reduced body 
weight, serum lipids (triglyceride and total cholesterol) levels, and enzymes 
(alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase) responsible for liver 
dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. GEF treatment also 
regulated the alteration in signaling pathways of lipid metabolism in HFD-fed 
mice by inhibiting the overexpression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. 
Mice treated with GEF had increased gut microbial diversity, reduced pathogenic 
bacteria, and increased Lactococcus and Streptococcaceae genera. Additionally, 
GEF treatment could increase the expression of intestinal tight junction 
proteins, which were otherwise decreased in HFD-fed mice, stipulating its 
protective effect in maintaining gut barrier integrity. Our study demonstrated 
that GEF treatment reduces obesity in mice and improves gut health by keeping 
junctions tight and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.

Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) and fluoride (F) affect gut health 
and potentially damage organs. The present study investigates the interplay 
between gut bacteria and oxidative stress (measured by MDA level, GSH level, 
catalase activity, Nrf2 translocation and expression) in zebrafish exposed to F 
(NaF 15 ppm) and As (As2O3 50 ppb) alone or in combination. Combined exposure to 
As and F reduced gut bacterial alteration and imposed less oxidative stress 
compared to F- exposure alone. V3-V4 metagenomic sequencing revealed 
Pseudomonas, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas genera dominated in As or F treated 
groups while As+F treated group was enriched in beneficial Lactococcus and 
Streptococcus genera. Functional KEGG analysis demonstrated treatment-specific 
changes in bacterial metabolism, host organismal systems, human diseases, as 
well as cellular processes of microbial community were significantly affected. 
When Aeromonas sp. isolated from F-treated fish gut, tagged with GFP-vector and 
fed (~3.2 × 106 CFU/mL) to untreated fish, induced oxidative stress in gut and 
kidney. Gut bacteria were found to both increase and mitigate iAs or F-toxicity, 
whereas As+F treatment promoted a protective response. Correlation analysis 
between gut microbial community at genus level and oxidative stress parameters 
of gut and kidney, showed Aeromonas and Plesiomonas genera are strongly 
correlated with oxidative stress (r = 0.5-0.9, p˂0.05). This study identifies 
microbiome biomarkers of iAs and F toxicity on gut-kidney axis.

BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, 
predominantly among older adults. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations 
of gut microbiome and metabolome may play an important role in MC pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively characterize alterations of the gut microbial and 
metabolic composition in MC.
DESIGN: We established a longitudinal cohort of adult patients with MC and two 
control groups of individuals - chronic diarrhea controls and age- and 
sex-matched controls without diarrhea. Using stool samples, gut microbiome was 
analyzed by whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and gut metabolome was 
profiled by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
Per-feature enrichment analyses of microbial species, metabolic pathways, and 
metabolites were done using multivariable linear models both cross-sectionally 
comparing MC to controls and longitudinally according to disease activity. 
Lastly, we performed multi-omics association analyses to assess the relationship 
between microbiome and metabolome data.
RESULTS: We included 683 participants, 131 with active MC (66 with both active 
and remission samples), 159 with chronic diarrhea, and 393 age- and sex-matched 
controls without diarrhea. The stool microbiome in active MC was characterized 
by a lower alpha diversity as compared to controls and the remission phase of 
MC. Compared to controls, we identified eight enriched species in MC, most of 
which were pro-inflammatory oral-typical species, such as Veillonella dispar and 
Haemophilus parainfluenzae . In contrast, 11 species, including 
anti-inflammatory microbes such as Blautia glucerasea and Bacteroides stercoris, 
were depleted in MC. Similarly, pro-inflammatory metabolites, including 
lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens were 
enriched in active MC as compared to controls or MC cases in remission. 
Multi-omics association analyses revealed strong and concordant links between 
microbes, their metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles, supporting the 
tight interplay between disturbances in stool microbiome and metabolome in MC.
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant shift in stool microbial and metabolomic 
composition in MC. Our findings could be used in the future for development of 
non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring MC and developing novel 
therapeutics.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Microbiome dysbiosis has been proposed to 
contribute to microscopic colitis (MC) pathogenesis.However, previous studies 
have been limited by small sample sizes, reliance on 16S rRNA sequencing 
technique, potential confounding by stool consistency, and lack of functional 
analyses of microbiome and longitudinal data. Moreover, the metabolomic 
composition of MC remain largely unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this largest longitudinal MC cohort with two control 
groups - chronic diarrhea controls and controls without diarrhea, gut microbiome 
of MC is characterized by a lower alpha diversity, enriched pro-inflammatory 
oral-typical species and depleted anti-inflammatory beneficial species.Gut 
metabolome of MC shows significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory metabolites, 
including lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens. 
Multi-omics analyses demonstrate strong and concordant relationships between 
microbes, metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: Our findings could 
facilitate development of non-invasive biomarkers and novel therapeutics for MC.

Oral microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of schizophrenia (SZ). 
While numerous studies have investigated alterations in the oral bacterial 
microbiota among SZ patients, investigations into the fungal microbiota, another 
integral component of the oral microbiota, are scarce. In this cross-sectional 
study, we enrolled 118 Chinese patients with SZ and 97 age-matched healthy 
controls (HCs) to evaluate the oral fungal microbiota from tongue coating 
samples using internal transcribed spacer 1 amplicon sequencing and assess host 
immunity via multiplex immunoassays. Our findings revealed that SZ patients 
exhibited reduced fungal richness and significant differences in β-diversity 
compared to HCs. Within the oral fungal communities, we identified two distinct 
fungal clusters (mycotypes): Candida and Malassezia, with SZ patients showing 
increased Malassezia and decreased Candida levels. These key functional oral 
fungi may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SZ. Furthermore, SZ 
patients displayed signs of immunological dysfunction, characterized by elevated 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, and chemokines 
including MIP-1α and MCP-1. Importantly, Malassezia mycotype correlated 
positively with peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, while Candida mycotype 
exhibited a negative correlation with these cytokines. In conclusion, we have 
demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of altered oral fungal 
communities and systemic immune dysfunction in Chinese SZ patients compared to 
HCs, providing novel insights into the potential role of oral fungi as 
biomarkers and the broader implications for understanding SZ pathogenesis.

PURPOSE: Emerging research in the field of microbiology has indicated that 
host-microbiota interactions play a significant role in regulating health and 
disease. Whereas the gut microbiome has received the most attention, distinct 
microbiota in other organs (mouth, larynx, and trachea) may undergo microbial 
shifts that impact disease states. A comprehensive understanding of microbial 
mechanisms and their role in communication and swallowing deficits may have 
downstream diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
METHOD: A literature review was completed to provide a broad overview of the 
microbiome, including differentiation of commensal versus pathogenic bacteria; 
cellular mechanisms by which bacteria interact with human cells; site-specific 
microbial compositional shifts in certain organs; and available reports of oral, 
laryngeal, and tracheal microbial dysbiosis in conditions that are associated 
with communication and swallowing deficits.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: This review article is a valuable tutorial for clinicians, 
specifically introducing them to the concept of dysbiosis, with potential 
contributions to communication and swallowing deficits. Future research should 
delineate the role of specific pathogenic bacteria in disease pathogenesis to 
identify therapeutic targets.

Antibiotics are safe, effective drugs and continue to save millions of lives and 
prevent long-term illness worldwide. A large body of epidemiological, 
interventional and experimental evidence shows that exposure to antibiotics has 
long-term negative effects on human health. We reviewed the literature data on 
the links between antibiotic exposure, gut dysbiosis, and chronic disease 
(notably with regard to the "developmental origins of health and disease" 
("DOHaD") approach). Molecular biology studies show that the systemic 
administration of antibiotic to infants has a rapid onset but also often a 
long-lasting impact on the microbial composition of the gut. Along with other 
environmental factors (e.g., an unhealthy "Western" diet and sedentary 
behavior), antibiotics induce gut dysbiosis, which can be defined as the 
disruption of a previously stable, functionally complete microbiota. Gut 
dysbiosis many harmful long-term effects on health. Associations between 
early-life exposure to antibiotics have been reported for chronic diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, some cancers, metabolic 
diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes), allergic diseases, autoimmune disorders, 
atherosclerosis, arthritis, and neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and other 
neurological diseases. In mechanistic terms, gut dysbiosis influences chronic 
disease through direct effects on mucosal immune and inflammatory pathways, plus 
a wide array of direct or indirect effects of short-chain fatty acids, the 
enteric nervous system, peristaltic motility, the production of hormones and 
neurotransmitters, and the loss of intestinal barrier integrity (notably with 
leakage of the pro-inflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide into the 
circulation). To mitigate dysbiosis, the administration of probiotics in 
patients with chronic disease is often (but not always) associated with positive 
effects on clinical markers (e.g., disease scores) and biomarkers of 
inflammation and immune activation. Meta-analyses are complicated by differences 
in probiotic composition, dose level, and treatment duration, and large, 
randomized, controlled clinical trials are lacking in many disease areas. In 
view of the critical importance of deciding whether or not to prescribe 
antibiotics (especially to children), we suggest that the DOHaD concept can be 
logically extended to "gastrointestinal origins of health and disease" ("GOHaD") 
or even "microbiotic origins of health and disease" ("MOHaD").

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: It is presently unclear why there is a high 
prevalence of periodontal disease in individuals living with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Whilst some have argued that periodontal disease causes CKD, we 
hypothesised that alterations in saliva and the oral microenvironment in 
organisms with kidney disease may initiate periodontal disease by causing 
dysbiosis of the oral microbiota.
METHODS: Experimental kidney disease was created using adenine feeding and 
subtotal nephrectomy in rats, and by adenine feeding in mice. Loss of 
periodontal bone height was assessed using a dissecting microscope supported by 
micro-CT, light, confocal and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. 
Salivary biochemistry was assessed using NMR spectroscopy. The oral microbiome 
was evaluated using culture-based and molecular methods, and the 
transmissibility of dysbiosis was assessed using co-caging and microbial 
transfer experiments into previously germ-free recipient mice.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that experimental kidney disease causes a reproducible 
reduction of alveolar bone height, without gingival inflammation or overt 
hyperparathyroidism but with evidence of failure of bone formation at the 
periodontal crest. We show that kidney disease alters the biochemical 
composition of saliva and induces progressive dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, 
with microbial samples from animals with kidney disease displaying reduced 
overall bacterial growth, increased alpha diversity, reduced abundance of key 
components of the healthy oral microbiota such as Streptococcus and Rothia, and 
an increase in minor taxa including those from gram-negative phyla 
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Co-housing diseased rats with healthy ones 
ameliorates the periodontal disease phenotype, whilst transfer of oral 
microbiota from mice with kidney disease causes periodontal disease in germ-free 
animals with normal kidney function.
CONCLUSIONS: We advocate that periodontal disease should be regarded as a 
complication of kidney disease, initiated by oral dysbiosis through mechanisms 
independent of overt inflammation or hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a 
global health crisis, with clinical manifestations including those suggesting 
injury to various organs such as the ovaries, which implies that it extends 
beyond respiratory infections. Changes in gut microbiota may exhibit 
correlations with the mechanisms and stages of severity in COVID-19, as well as 
a link with sex hormones, embryo development, and pregnancy. Controlled ovarian 
stimulation (COS) is used to induce the development of multiple high-quality 
follicles during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our research aimed to investigate 
whether patients infected with COVID-19 have altered gut microbiota compositions 
that would affect the outcomes of COS.
METHODS: Twenty-one healthy females and seventeen patients with COVID-19 were 
enrolled. Samples were sequenced for gut microbiota identification through 16 S 
rRNA V3-V4 region, including species annotation, community diversity, and 
community functions.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of in 
IVF cycle outcomes and laboratory parameters. Patients with COVID-19 and healthy 
women showed no significant difference in the total number of available 
blastocyst embryos. Furthermore, the gut microbiota alpha diversity index in the 
COVID-19 group were markedly reduced compared to those of healthy females. 
Comparing the COVID-19 group to the controls, the gut microbiota dysbiosis 
decreased levels of Ruminococcus, and Agathobater, and elevated levels of 
Achromobacter and Raistonia. Finally, we identified a series of microbial 
functional characteristics, including membrane transport and carbohydrate 
metabolism, that exhibited significant disparities between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the COVID-19 group exhibited significant disparities in 
the gut microbiota composition compared to the healthy women during COS. 
However, the IVF outcomes did not show any significant differences between the 
two groups. Collectively, our speculation suggests that SARS-COV-2 infection may 
alter the gut microbiota without impacting IVF outcomes.

The intestinal microbiota (IM) plays a role in the severity of 
alcohol-associated liver disease. Modifying severe alcohol-associated hepatitis 
(AH) dysbiosis improves liver injury through tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and 
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). However, Trp's effect on the IM in alcohol 
use disorder (AUD) patients remains unclear. Here, we used an in vitro 
microbiota modeling system named Minibioreactor arrays (MBRAs). Feces from AUD 
patients with or without AH were treated with low, normal, or high Trp 
concentrations, with subsequent treatment with alcohol. Microbiota composition 
and AhR activity were studied. We showed that microbial communities from donors 
were maintained in MBRAs. High and low Trp increased the abundance of pathogen 
Escherichia Shigella. In the absence of alcohol, Trp changed more bacteria in 
AUD IM compared to AH IM. Normal Trp increased the AhR activity. Overall, 
maintaining normal Trp levels may prevent dysbiosis in AUD or AH, pending in 
vivo confirmation.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by 
chronic inflammation and joint destruction, with emerging evidence implicating 
gut microbiota dysbiosis in its pathogenesis. The current study explores the 
role of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent 
lipid peroxidation, in modulating gut microbiota and metabolic dysregulation 
through the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) in collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that ferroptosis 
exacerbates RA-related inflammatory responses and joint damage by upregulating 
PAD4 expression, which, in turn, influences the gut microbial composition and 
associated metabolite profiles. Erastin, a known ferroptosis agonist, 
significantly increased the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria such 
as Proteobacteria while reducing beneficial taxa like Firmicutes and 
Bacteroidetes. This microbial shift was associated with heightened oxidative 
stress and an imbalance in key metabolites, such as lysophosphatidyl 
ethanolamine 14:0 (LysoPE 14:0), further exacerbated by ferroptosis. 
Co-treatment with GSK484, a PAD4 inhibitor, reversed these effects, restoring 
microbial homeostasis and reducing joint inflammation. This study suggests that 
ferroptosis-mediated PAD4 activity contributes to RA pathogenesis by disrupting 
the gut-joint axis, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets 
for RA. Our results highlight the intricate interplay between immune-mediated 
cell death, gut microbiota, and systemic inflammation, emphasizing the 
importance of ferroptosis as a therapeutic target in mitigating RA progression.

Data from the literature indicates that the human ocular surface is inhabited by 
diverse commensal microbial communities, crucial for maintaining the homeostasis 
of healthy eyes. The ocular surface microbiome (OSM) plays a protective 
immunoregulatory role against pathogenic species, and any dysbiosis may 
contribute to disease onset. Traditional culture methods, employed in both 
clinical and research settings, have limitations. Certain pathogens are 
challenging to grow under routine conditions, leading to lower bacterial 
detection compared to next-generation sequencing (NGS). Despite the extensive 
use of NGS in published studies, variable results are observed. This variability 
may be attributed to factors such as limited sample size, differences in 
analytical procedures (from sampling to sequencing platforms), age and gender 
variations in included populations, diverse inclusion criteria, and geographical 
differences. These factors collectively impact the generated genomic data. 
Moreover, consistent reports on diversity indices are lacking in various 
published studies, whereas these indices could enhance the definition of OSM 
changes in disease states. Therefore, this review emphasizes the current 
imperative to standardize OSM sample collection, preparation, and analysis. This 
standardization is vital for accurately defining the composition of OSM in both 
healthy and pathogenic conditions and facilitating meaningful comparisons among 
studies.

Peri-implantitis, a complex condition that can lead to dental implant failure, 
is characterized by inflammatory destruction resulting from immune 
dysregulation. Oral microbial dysbiosis and foreign body stimulation are the 
main factors contributing to such dysregulation, impairing immune cell function 
and triggering an inflammatory response. Immune dysregulation plays a critical 
role in the pathophysiology of peri-implantitis, impacting the balance of T cell 
subsets, the production of inflammatory factors, and immune-related molecular 
signaling pathways. Understanding the relationship between immune dysregulation 
and peri-implantitis is crucial for developing targeted strategies for clinical 
diagnosis and individualized treatment planning. This review explores the 
similarities and differences in the immune microenvironment of oral bacterial 
infections and foreign body rejection, analyzes the relevant molecular signaling 
pathways, and identifies new key targets for developing innovative 
immunotherapeutic drugs and effective and personalized treatment modalities for 
peri-implantitis. Additionally, it addresses the challenges and potential 
directions for translating immunotherapy into clinical practice for 
peri-implantitis, offering insights that bridge the gaps in current literature 
and pave the way for future research.

Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or 
over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the 
microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized 
that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives 
might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In 
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and 
indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many 
proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), 
while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and 
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of 
acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A 
similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan 
and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while 
C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. 
Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of 
genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. 
anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly 
lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy 
controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell 
proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes 
(STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while 
IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex 
vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 
associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest 
that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut 
microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 
infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening 
patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help 
identify at-risk individuals.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most devastating intestinal 
diseases observed in preterm in the first days of life. Researchers have 
recently focused on potential predictive biomarkers for early and concomitant 
diagnoses. Thus, we inquired about the linkage of intestinal dysbiosis, one of 
the most important factors in NEC development to the gut microbiota. In this 
study, the systematic differences in the bacterial composition between neonates 
affected by NEC and healthy newborns were highlighted by metagenomic analysis. 
The next-generation sequencing of the V3-V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene 
and gene-specific qPCR analyzed the untargeted gut microbiota. Total bacteria, 
total and fecal coliform loads in stool samples with NEC were higher than 
control. OTU-level relative abundances of NEC infant was characterized by 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at phylum levels. At the genus level, NEC stool was 
identified by the lack of Klebsiella and the presence of Roseburia, Blautia, and 
Parasutterella. Finally, Clostridium fessum was the predominant species of 
Clostridium genus in disease and healthy specimens at the species level, whereas 
Clostridium jeddahitimonense was at NEC diagnosis. Despite a strong relationship 
between pathophysiology and characterization of gut microbiota at a clinical 
diagnosis of NEC, our results emphasize the broad difficulty in identifying 
potential biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of obesity is continually rising worldwide, posing 
a risk for the development of various serious diseases. The pathogenesis of 
obesity is complex and recent research suggests a link between obesity and the 
oral microbiome, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected saliva samples from 9 non-obese and 13 obese 
participants and conducted 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the differences in 
oral microbiota between obese and non-obese individuals in terms of microbial 
abundance, functionality, and interaction networks.
RESULTS: Obese participants exhibited a distinct composition of salivary 
microbiota compared to non-obese participants, with a greater number of ASVs 
detected and higher α diversity indices. Specifically, Haemophilus, 
Aggregatibacter, and Actinobacillus were significantly enriched, while 
Actinomyces showed significant depletion. Functional prediction analysis 
indicated that biofilm formation pathways were significantly more abundant in 
the obese group. Random forest regression model analysis identified Bergeyella 
as the most contributive genus, and interaction network analysis suggested that 
Bergeyella may function as a bridge node, linking the obese group-enriched 
genera to the broader microbial community and facilitating the exchange of 
information and resources.
DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that obesity may be closely associated with 
salivary microbiota dysbiosis and functional changes. Further research is needed 
to elucidate the causal relationship and underlying molecular mechanisms between 
obesity and oral microbiota dysbiosis, or to determine if they mutually 
influence each other.

This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between gut 
microbiota, diet, and insulin resistance, emphasizing the novel roles of 
diet-induced microbial changes in influencing metabolic health. It highlights 
how diet significantly influences gut microbiota composition, with different 
dietary patterns fostering diverse microbial communities. These diet-induced 
changes in the microbiome impact human metabolism by affecting inflammation, 
energy balance, and insulin sensitivity, particularly through microbial 
metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Focusing the key mediators 
like endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, and introduces personalized 
microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, it also investigates the effects of 
dietary components-fiber, polyphenols, and lipids-on microbiota and insulin 
sensitivity, along with the roles of protein intake and amino acid metabolism. 
The study compares the effects of Western and Mediterranean diets on the 
microbiota-insulin resistance axis. Therapeutic implications, including 
probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and personalized diets, are 
discussed. Key findings reveal that high-fat diets, especially those rich in 
saturated fats, contribute to dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, 
while high-fiber diets promote beneficial bacteria and SCFAs. The review 
underscores the future potential of food and microbiota interventions for 
preventing or managing insulin resistance.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome plays a significant role in longevity, and dysbiosis 
is indeed one of the hallmarks of aging. However, the causal relationship 
between gut microbiota and human longevity or aging remains elusive.
METHODS: Our study assessed the causal relationships between gut microbiome and 
longevity using Mendelian Randomization (MR). Summary statistics for the gut 
microbiome were obtained from four genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
meta-analysis of the MiBioGen consortium (N = 18,340), Dutch Microbiome Project 
(N = 7738), German individuals (N = 8956), and Finland individuals (N = 5959). 
Summary statistics for Longevity were obtained from Five GWAS meta-analysis, 
including Human healthspan (N = 300,447), Longevity (N = 36,745), Lifespans 
(N = 1,012,240), Parental longevity (N = 389,166), and Frailty (one of the 
primary aging-linked physiological hallmarks, N = 175,226).
RESULTS: Our findings reveal several noteworthy associations, including a 
negative correlation between Bacteroides massiliensis and longevity, whereas the 
genus Subdoligranulum and Alistipes, as well as species Alistipes senegalensis 
and Alistipes shahii, exhibited positive associations with specific longevity 
traits. Moreover, the microbial pathway of coenzyme A biosynthesis I, pyruvate 
fermentation to acetate and lactate II, and pentose phosphate pathway exhibited 
positive associations with two or more traits linked to longevity. Conversely, 
the TCA cycle VIII (helicobacter) pathway consistently demonstrated a negative 
correlation with lifespan and parental longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of this MR study indicated many significant 
associations between gut microbiome and longevity. These microbial taxa and 
pathways may potentially play a protective role in promoting longevity or have a 
suppressive effect on lifespan.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of metabolic disorders which have a tight 
correlation with dysbiosis of gut microbiota (GM) that have to be treated to 
avoid higher risks for health. In this work, probiotics obtained from healthy 
cultured GM were provided to rats with metabolic syndrome (MSR) as therapy in 
treating MS through the correction of dysbiosis. MSR showed obesity, high blood 
pressure, abnormal blood chemistry parameters and high heart rate respect to 
control rats (CNTR). Cultivated GM from feces of MSR in media favoring anaerobic 
species, showed dysbiosis as judged by differences in the 16S rRNA metabarcoding 
analysis and by affected intermediary metabolism (methane and SCFA production, 
nutrients consumption and enzyme activities) compared to CNTR. The metabarcoding 
analysis of cultured healthy GM identified 211 species, which were further 
transplanted alive in MSR once a week for 9 weeks. Thereafter, in transplanted 
MSR the excess of Clostridium and Lactobacillus diminished, while Prevotella, 
Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium and methanogens, among others increased, leading 
to the recovery of the microbial metabolic capacity. The presence of butyric 
acid-producing bacteria in the transplanted GM correlated with increased levels 
of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, transplanted MSR recovered the normal 
levels of weight, blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol as well as the 
heart function. Data suggested that the great diversity of species contained in 
the GM transplanted restored the microbial metabolism, consuming excessive 
nutrients and secondary metabolites produced by MS. The use of cultivated GM as 
probiotics may be a safer alternative for the treatment of different diseases.

Harnessing the microbiome: probiotics, antibiotics and their role in canine and 
feline gastrointestinal disease.

Unfavourable alterations of the host microbial environment, known as dysbiosis, 
have been identified in many canine and feline gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. 
As a result, normalisation of microbial composition and function has become an 
important therapeutic target. Given the complex and individualistic interplay 
between the resident microbiota, host and environment, a multimodal approach is 
often necessary when addressing dysbiosis in dogs and cats with GI disease. 
Systemic antibiotics are often empirically used to treat acute and chronic GI 
diseases. However, with modern genomic techniques demonstrating the profound 
negative effect antibiotics can have on the GI microbiota and the rapid 
emergence of resistant bacteria globally, there has been an increased focus on 
identifying antibiotic alternatives for use in small animal practice. Biotics, 
such as prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, are of growing interest due to 
their potential supportive effect on the microbiota. This article reviews the 
evidence for the use of biotics in canine and feline GI disease, highlighting 
how judicious use of antibiotics and targeted probiotic supplementation can 
enhance patient outcomes by promoting a balanced gut microbial environment.

INTRODUCTION: Crohn's Disease (CD) is characterized by chronic intestinal 
inflammation and dysbiosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 
plant-based diet (PBD) on gut microbiota composition and inflammation in CD 
patients and assess the utility of trnL gene sequencing for monitoring dietary 
adherence.
METHODS: Fourteen CD patients participated in a 12-week PBD intervention. 
Dietary adherence was monitored through self-reported food diaries and trnL 
sequencing, which detects plant residues in fecal samples. Gut microbiota was 
analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and fecal calprotectin levels were measured 
as an indicator of intestinal inflammation.
RESULTS: TrnL sequencing identified 55 plant genera in fecal samples, compared 
to 41 reported in food diaries, highlighting its accuracy in assessing plant 
residue diversity. By week 4, participants demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in 
plant intake, correlating with a significant increase in microbial diversity. 
Key genera associated with gut health, such as Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides, 
increased in abundance. Additionally, fecal calprotectin levels decreased from 
472 mg/kg at baseline to 207 mg/kg at week 12, indicating reduced intestinal 
inflammation.
DISCUSSION: A PBD positively influenced gut microbiota composition and decreased 
intestinal inflammation in CD patients. The study also demonstrated that trnL 
sequencing is an effective tool for assessing dietary adherence in clinical 
settings, offering a more objective measure than self-reported food diaries.

Cancer is a predominant cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating the 
development of innovative therapeutic techniques. The human microbiome, 
particularly the gut microbiota, has become a significant element in cancer 
research owing to its essential role in sustaining health and influencing 
disease progression. This review examines the microbiome's makeup and essential 
functions, including immunological modulation and metabolic regulation, which 
may be evaluated using sophisticated methodologies such as metagenomics and 16S 
rRNA sequencing. The microbiome influences cancer development by promoting 
inflammation, modulating the immune system, and producing carcinogenic 
compounds. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, can undermine the epithelial 
barrier and facilitate cancer. The microbiome influences chemotherapy and 
radiation results by modifying drug metabolism, either enhancing or reducing 
therapeutic efficacy and contributing to side effects and toxicity. 
Comprehending these intricate relationships emphasises the microbiome's 
significance in oncology and accentuates the possibility for microbiome-targeted 
therapeutics. Contemporary therapeutic approaches encompass the utilisation of 
probiotics and dietary components to regulate the microbiome, enhance treatment 
efficacy, and minimise unwanted effects. Advancements in research indicate that 
personalised microbiome-based interventions, have the potential to transform 
cancer therapy, by providing more effective and customised treatment 
alternatives. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
microbiome's influence on the onset and treatment of cancer, while emphasising 
current trends and future possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome dysbiosis and related immune dysfunction have been 
associated with the pathogenesis of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in 
infants with neonatal cholestasis (NC) as previously reported by us. However, 
the interaction of a perturbed microbiome, HCMV infection, and dysregulated 
immunity leading to exacerbation of disease severity has not been investigated 
so far. In this study, we examined the association of gut microbiome, host 
inflammatory and homeostatic markers that are likely to govern increased 
pathogenesis of NC in HCMV infected IgM positive infants (N = 15) compared to 
IgM negative (N = 15) individuals. Stool samples of HCMV infected infants and 
age-matched healthy controls (N = 10) were assessed for gut bacteria-derived 
metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
cytokines and markers of gut barrier integrity. Data were correlated with 
previously determined gut microbiome composition and frequency of immune cell 
subsets. Finally, validation of clinical potential was undertaken by principal 
component analysis (PCA) of integrated data to delineate the spectrum of 
clinical pathology.
RESULTS: Significantly lower levels of SCFAs and elevated fecal levels of 
soluble inflammatory mediators were observed in IgM positive HCMV infected 
infants. Further, increased plasma LPS levels and markers of gut permeability, 
suggestive of microbial translocation due to a 'leaky gut' were observed in HCMV 
infected IgM positive group. PCA of integrated data revealed clearly disparate 
profiles representative of IgM positive, IgM negative, and uninfected healthy 
states.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the utility of an integrated approach involving 
dysregulated microbiome-immune axis for gaining a better understanding of 
pathogenesis associated with HCMV infection in NC.

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective in 
reversing gut dysbiosis, we lack an understanding of the fundamental processes 
underlying microbial engraftment in the mammalian gut. Here, we explored a 
murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in 
gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a 
natural "super-donor" consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients 
and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome 
showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 
h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, 
engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract 
in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested 
engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing 
species from the super-donor consortia. These results offer a mechanism of 
super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a 
spatiotemporally dependent manner. A record of this paper's transparent peer 
review process is included in the supplemental information.

Rational treatment of acute rhinosinusitis in the context of increasing 
antibiotic resistance.

Arcimowicz M(1).

Author information:

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diseases in the population, both 
in primary and specialist otolaryngological care. It is also responsible for a 
disturbingly high percentage of prescribed antibiotic therapy, regardless of the 
etiology of the disease. Despite the fact that acute viral and acute postviral 
rhinosinusitis dominate among the phenotypes of acute rhinosinusitis, and the 
development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis occurs in only 0.5-2% of all cases 
in adults and 5-10% in children, antibiotics still remain an important element 
of treatment, despite alarming data on the growing antibiotic resistance and the 
adverse effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome, leading to dysbiosis. The 
discovery of antibiotics was one of the greatest achievements of modern 
medicine, but their inappropriate use leads to the gradual increase in the 
phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, considered one of the most serious public 
health problems, recognized by the WHO as one of the 10 greatest threats to 
human health in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. The unjustified use of 
antibiotics in outpatient care is the key to the growth of this problem, in 
parallel with the lack of patient compliance. The COVID pandemic has intensified 
this unfavourable trend. That is why the knowledge of antibiotic stewardship is 
so important. According to the guidelines, in the therapy of acute 
rhinosinusitis, symptomatic and anti-inflammatory treatment dominates, and 
antibiotic therapy has very strictly defined and limited indications. The latest 
guidelines also recommend herbal medicines, including BNO 1016, in the treatment 
of acute viral and postviral rhinosinusitis. Available studies indicate that it 
has a beneficial effect not only on shortening the duration of the disease and 
reducing symptoms, but also reduces the need for antibiotic treatment in acute 
rhinosinusitis. Complications of acute rhinosinusitis are relatively rare and 
are not related to taking antibiotics.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to the process of alveolar inflammation induced by 
the inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions into the lower respiratory tract. 
Predisposing factors comprise swallowing dysfunction, impaired cough reflex, and 
degenerative neurological diseases. Accumulating evidence projects a fading 
contribution of anaerobic bacteria in aspiration pneumonia at the expense of 
Gram-negative bacilli, with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, becoming the predominant organisms recovered from 
respiratory specimens. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions colonized with 
respiratory pathogens induces a profound disequilibrium of the lung microbiota 
resulting in a state of dysbiosis. Understanding this complex temporal 
variability between microbiome-host associations was only made possible with the 
introduction of metagenomic sequencing. In this narrative review, we summarize 
existing knowledge and elaborate on the evolving microbiology of aspiration 
pneumonia including the link between oral microbiome and pulmonary aspiration. 
We also highlight the progress and challenges in instituting microbiome-targeted 
strategies for preventing and treating the sequelae of aspiration pneumonia.

The Anti-Elixir Triad: Non-Synced Circadian Rhythm, Gut Dysbiosis and Telomeric 
Damage.

Mani AK, Parvathi VD, Ravindran S.

Aging is an inevitable life process which is accelerated by lifestyle and 
environmental factors. It is an irreversible accretion of molecular and cellular 
damage associated with changes in the body composition and deterioration in 
physiological functions. Each cell (other than stem cells), reaches the limit of 
its ability to replicate, known as cellular or replicative senescence and 
consequently, the organs lose their physiological functions resulting in overall 
impairment. Other factors that promote aging include smoking, alcohol, UV rays, 
sleep habits, food, stress, sedentary life style and genetic abnormalities. 
These stress factors, can alter our endogenous clock (the circadian rhythm) and 
the microbial commensals. As a result of effect of these stressors, the 
microorganisms that generally support human physiological processes become 
baleful. The disturbance of natural physiology instigates many age-related 
pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disorder, cerebrovascular diseases, opportunistic infections, high blood 
pressure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. 
The present review covers the three most essential processes of the circadian 
clock; the circadian gene mechanism and regulation, the mitotic clock (which 
plays a vital role in the telomere's attrition) and gut microbiota and their 
metabolome that drive aging and lead to age-related pathologies. In conclusion, 
maintaining a synchronized circadian rhythm, a healthy gut microbiome and 
telomere integrity is essential for mitigating the effects of aging and 
promoting longevity. The interplay among these factors underscores the 
importance of lifestyle choices in enhancing overall health and lifespan.

A poor maternal diet during pregnancy predisposes the infant to severe lower 
respiratory tract infections (sLRIs), which, in turn, increases childhood asthma 
risk; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show 
that the offspring of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mothers (HFD-reared pups) 
developed an sLRI following pneumovirus inoculation in early life and subsequent 
asthma in later life upon allergen exposure. Prior to infection, HFD-reared pups 
developed microbial dysbiosis and low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI), 
characterized by hyperneutropoiesis in the liver and elevated inflammatory 
cytokine expression, most notably granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 
interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) (indicative of 
IL-6 trans-signaling) in the circulation and multiple organs but most 
prominently the liver. Inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling using sgp130Fc 
transgenic mice or via specific genetic deletion of IL-6Ra on neutrophils 
conferred protection against both diseases. Taken together, our findings suggest 
that a maternal HFD induces neonatal LGSI that predisposes to sLRI and

BACKGROUND: Pediatric cow milk allergies (CMA) can occur in immunoglobulin (Ig) 
E and non-IgE-mediated forms. Unlike IgE-mediated allergies, the mechanisms of 
disease pathogenesis in non-IgE-mediated food allergy and an association with 
microbiome has not been well established. Previous studies have identified the 
presence of altered humoral responses to gut bacteria in IgE mediated allergies. 
Here, we analyzed IgA, IgE and IgG responses to gut bacteria in subjects with 
either IgE or non-IgE mediated CMA to identify relative proportions of Ig-coated 
bacteria and characterize unique disease specific microbial signatures.
METHODS: Multi-parametric flow cytometry analysis was used to identify IgA, IgE 
and IgG responses to gut bacteria in CMA patients. Cell sorting of Ig coated gut 
bacteria was subsequently performed followed by high throughput 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing and specific patterns of humoral responses to gut bacteria assessed 
in each study group.
RESULTS: We identified significant alterations in IgA and IgG gut bacterial 
coating patterns in CMA subjects. Proportions of IgA-coated bacteria were 
decreased in IgE mediated CMA subjects without atopic dermatitis (ALL) and 
non-IgE mediated CMA subjects (ENP), compared to healthy controls (CON). In 
comparison, IgG-coated bacteria was significantly elevated in CMA subjects with 
atopic dermatitis (AD). Alpha and beta diversities displayed significant 
differences in IgA-, IgE-, and IgG-coated bacteria in AD and ENP groups. 
Significant differences in bacteria coated by IgA, IgE and IgG were detected at 
Phyla, Genus and Species levels and associated bacterial dysbiosis in IgE and 
non-IgE mediated allergies were identified. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) 
effect size (LEFse) revealed unique disease associated bacterial signatures, 
including several pathogenic bacteria namely Bacteroides fragilis, Ruminococcus 
gnavus, Eubacterium dolichum, Fusobacterium, Clostridium neonatale and 
Robinsoniella peoriensis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
confirmed the efficiency of using the bacterial signatures identified as 
biomarkers for disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Altered IgA and IgG responses to gut bacteria were identified in 
CMA subjects. The disease-specific responses were associated with alterations in 
bacterial diversity and concomitant dysbiosis of Ig-coated bacteria in 
IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMA pediatric subjects. The identification of 
pathogenic bacteria uniquely associated with different classes of allergic 
disease indicates a role of these bacteria in driving disease-specific 
pathological phenotypes.

Many patients with IBD report persisting symptoms, despite resolution of the 
inflammatory process. Although by definition, a diagnosis of IBS cannot be made, 
the prevalence of 'IBS in IBD' surpasses the rate of IBS in the global 
population by fivefold. Because IBS-like symptoms are associated with a 
decreased quality of life and increased healthcare utilisation in IBD, diagnosis 
and treatment are necessary. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge 
on IBS-like symptoms in IBD. A pathophysiological common ground is present, 
which includes genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, gut microbial 
dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and 
involvement of brain-gut interaction. When symptoms persist after resolution of 
inflammation, other GI diseases should be excluded based on the chief complaint, 
considering any possible psychological co-morbidity early in the diagnostic 
work-up. Subsequent treatment should be initiated that is evidence-based and 
often multimodal, including classical and non-classical pharmacological agents 
as well as lifestyle and microbiota-based approaches, spanning the breadth of 
the gut, brain and its interaction. Treatment goals in this substantial part of 
the IBD population should be adapted to not only focus on treating the 
inflammation but taking care of the patient.

A high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with various adverse health outcomes, 
including cognitive impairment and an elevated risk of neurodegenerative 
conditions. This relationship is partially attributed to the influence of an HFD 
on the gut microbiota. The objective of this research was to evaluate the 
neuroprotective benefits of co-fermented black barley and quinoa with 
Lactobacillus (FG) against cognitive impairments triggered by an HFD and to 
investigate the microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms involved. C57BL/6J mice 
were randomized into four groups: the normal control group (NC, n = 10), the 
high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10), the high-fat diet group supplemented with FG 
(HFG, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10), and the high-fat diet group supplemented with 
Lactobacillus (HFL, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10). Our results showed that the FG 
intervention enhanced the behavioral and locomotor skills of the mice, elevated 
the levels of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NPI) in brain tissues, and 
alleviated synaptic ultrastructural damage in the hippocampus. Furthermore, FG 
intervention was observed to exert a protective effect on both the blood-brain 
barrier and the colonic barrier, as evidenced by an increase in the mRNA levels 
of Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), Claudin-4, and Occludin in the hippocampus and 
colon. These beneficial effects may be attributed to FG's regulation of gut 
microbiota dysbiosis, which involves the restoration of intestinal flora 
diversity, reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, and a decrease 
in the levels of pro-inflammatory bacteria such as s_Escherichia coli E and 
g_Escherichia; moreover, there was an increase in the abundances of 
anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as s_Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and 
s_Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the FG 
treatment downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathway and upregulated 
neurotransmitter biosynthetic pathways. These probiotic effects of FG resulted 
in reduced production and "leakage" of LPS and decreased mRNA expression of 
Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), and myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) in hippocampal and colon tissues. 
Consequently, a reduction was observed in the levels of inflammatory cytokines 
in the serum, hippocampus, and colon, along with suppression of the 
immunoreactivity of microglia and astrocytes. Our results suggest that FG may 
serve as an intervention strategy for preventing cognitive impairments caused by 
an HFD.

Periodontitis (PD) is characterized by the host's inflammatory responses to 
microbial dental biofilm dysbiosis, potentially resulting in tooth loss if left 
untreated. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune 
disease leading to synovial inflammation and destruction of joint cartilage and 
bone. The suggested association between PD and RA is based on the potential of 
chronic inflammation present in periodontitis, which could induce alterations in 
proteins through post-translational modifications, leading to the formation of 
citrullinated and carbamylated protein antigens. Antibodies directed against 
these antigens can serve as biomarkers for the underlying immunological 
processes in RA. Recent studies have also focused on bacterial proteolytic 
enzymes released from PD-associated bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis 
and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which are also sources of these 
antibodies. Chronic inflammation in PD causes increased levels of inflammatory 
cytokines (interferon-α, interleukins-6 and 8, tumor necrosis factor-α) and 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The oral microbiota in PD is also 
associated with the release of NETs (a process known as NETosis). Elevated NET 
levels are a source of citrullinated and carbamylated proteins which highlights 
their role in an individual's risk of developing RA (pre-RA individuals) and the 
progression of chronic RA. This narrative review describes periodontitis and the 
dysbiotic subgingival microbiota and its role in NETosis as risk factors for 
inducing early RA and the prospects of identifying pre-RA individuals and 
seronegative RA patients with these risk factors.

INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota is believed to be directly involved in the 
etiology and development of chronic liver diseases. However, the holistic 
characterization of the gut bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome in patients with 
chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis (CHB-LF) remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the multi-kingdom gut microbiome (i.e., 
bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome) of 25 CHB-LF patients and 28 healthy 
individuals through whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of their stool samples.
RESULTS: We found that the gut bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome of CHB-LF 
patients were fundamentally altered, characterized by a panel of 110 
differentially abundant bacterial species, 16 differential fungal species, and 
90 differential viruses. The representative CHB-LF-enriched bacteria included 
members of Blautia_A (e.g., B. wexlerae, B. massiliensis, and B. obeum), Dorea 
(e.g., D. longicatena and D. formicigenerans), Streptococcus, 
Erysipelatoclostridium, while some species of Bacteroides (e.g., B. finegoldii 
and B. thetaiotaomicron), Faecalibacterium (mainly F. prausnitzii), and 
Bacteroides_A (e.g., B. plebeius_A and B. coprophilus) were depleted in 
patients. Fungi such as Malassezia spp. (e.g., M. japonica and M. sympodialis), 
Candida spp. (e.g., C. parapsilosis), and Mucor circinelloides were more 
abundant in CHB-LF patients, while Mucor irregularis, Phialophora verrucosa, 
Hortaea werneckii, and Aspergillus fumigatus were decreases. The CHB-LF-enriched 
viruses contained 18 Siphoviridae, 12 Myoviridae, and 1 Podoviridae viruses, 
while the control-enriched viruses included 16 Siphoviridae, 9 Myoviridae, 2 
Quimbyviridae, and 1 Podoviridae_crAss-like members. Moreover, we revealed that 
the CHB-LF-associated gut multi-kingdom signatures were tightly interconnected, 
suggesting that they may act together on the disease. Finally, we showed that 
the microbial signatures were effective in discriminating the patients from 
healthy controls, suggesting the potential of gut microbiota in the prediction 
of CHB-LF and related diseases.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our findings delineated the fecal bacteriome, 
mycobiome, and virome landscapes of the CHB-LF microbiota and provided 
biomarkers that will aid in future mechanistic and clinical intervention 
studies.

Poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP), one of the main active components of P. cocos, 
is extensively used worldwide and exhibits strong pharmacological effects. 
However, whether PCP can attenuate inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. 
In this study, we assessed the effects of PCP supplementation on dextran 
sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. We found that PCP 
supplementation mitigated UC symptoms in DSS-treated mice, as evidenced by 
reductions in body weight loss, colon length shortening and disease activity 
index score. Importantly, PCP supplementation enhanced colonic barrier integrity 
by increasing tight junction protein abundance and exerted anti-inflammatory 
effects by suppressing nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in DSS-treated mice. 
Furthermore, PCP supplementation reversed DSS-induced dysbiosis in colonic 
microbiota by increasing the colonic abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g. 
Akkermansiaceae) and decreasing the colonic abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g. 
Erysipelotrichaceae) in DSS-treated mice. Although PCP supplementation failed to 
ameliorate DSS-induced UC in antibiotic-treated mice, faecal microbiota 
transplantation from PCP-administered mice ameliorated DSS-induced UC in 
antibiotic-treated mice. In summary, PCP alleviates UC in mice by attenuating 
intestinal inflammation via the inhibition of NF-κB activation and modulating 
the intestinal microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Food allergies, particularly peanut (PN) allergies, are a growing 
concern, with fatal anaphylaxis incidents often reported. While palforzia is the 
sole FDA-approved drug for managing PN allergies, it is not universally 
effective.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential of Gynostemma 
pentaphyllum saponins (GpS) as a novel therapeutic agent for PN allergy through 
modulation of gut microbiota, addressing the limitations of current treatments.
METHODS: To elucidate the role of GpS on peanut allergy, we first built a 
PN-sensitized C57BL/6J model mice. Through comprehensive sequencing analysis, we 
identified Parabacteroides distasonis as a key bacterium triggering PN 
sensitization. Employing the same mouse model, GpS was evaluated for its effects 
on anaphylactic symptoms, serum immunoglobulin levels, and allergy-related 
biomarkers. 16S rRNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were applied to 
investigate the impact of GpS on the host's gut epithelium and microbiome.
RESULTS: GpS treatment effectively reduced anaphylactic symptoms in 
PN-sensitized mice, as shown by decreased IgG1, total IgE, and PN-specific IgE 
levels. It also modulated the immune response by suppressing proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-21) and chemokines (CCL5, CCL12, CCL17, CCL22), 
while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13). Fecal 
microbial transplant from GpS-treated Model mice to PN-sensitized mice displayed 
anti-peanut allergy effects. Additionally, the administration of GpS-enhanced 
bacteria (Clostridium aldenese or Lactobacillus murinus), alleviated 
anaphylactic symptoms and reduced serum allergy markers in PN-sensitized mice.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, we revealed the intestinal environment, signaling 
molecules, mucosal cytokines, and commensal microbial profiles in the 
peanut-sensitized mouse model. We further presented evidence for the protective 
effect of GpS against PN allergen sensitization by downregulating a series of 
food-allergy-associated biomarkers and cytokines via the modulation of gut 
bacteria. More importantly, supported by both in vitro and in vivo experiments, 
we demonstrated that the protective effect of GpS against PN-allergy is through 
the enhancement of two commensal bacteria, Clostridium aldenese, and 
Lactobacillus murinus.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency and 
hyperglycemia, and its incidence is increasing year by year. The pathogenesis of 
T1DM is complex, mainly including genetic and environmental factors. Intestinal 
flora is the largest microbial community in the human body and plays a very 
important role in human health and disease. In recent years, more and more 
studies have shown that intestinal flora and its metabolites, as an 
environmental factor, regulate the development of T1DM through various 
mechanisms such as altering the intestinal mucosal barrier, influencing insulin 
secretion and body immune regulation. Intestinal flora transplantation, 
probiotic supplementation, and other approaches to modulate the intestinal flora 
appear to be potential therapeutic approaches for T1DM. This article reviews the 
dysbiosis of the intestinal flora in T1DM, the potential mechanisms by which the 
intestinal flora affects T1DM, as well as discusses potential approaches to 
treating T1DM by intervening in the intestinal flora.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the causes of hypertension is important in order to 
prevent the disease. Gut microbiota (GM) seems to play an important role, but 
the detailed physiology remains elusive, with alpha diversity being the most 
studied indicator.
OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to systematically synthesize data on gut 
microbiota (alpha diversity) and hypertension.
METHODS: Databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE, and citations 
were systematically queried. We retrieved articles reporting the association 
between gut microbiota and hypertension. A valid critical appraisal tool was 
also used to investigate the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Eighteen eligible studies met our inclusion criteria. In this report, 
we focused on the following indices of alpha diversity: Shannon, Chao1, Simpson, 
and Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE) indices. Several studies observed a 
significantly lower Shannon index in hypertensive patients compared to the 
healthy control group. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was 
found for the Chao1, Simpson, and ACE indices between hypertensive patients and 
controls. A higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) was 
consistently observed in hypertensive patients compared to healthy controls, 
indicating potential dysbiosis in the gut microbiota.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review indicates that hypertensive patients may 
exhibit an imbalance in gut microbiota, evidenced by decreased alpha diversity 
and an elevated F/B ratio. However, the absence of statistically significant 
differences in secondary diversity indices (Chao1, Simpson, and ACE) highlights 
the need for further research. Well-designed, large-scale studies are necessary 
to clarify these associations and explore the role of gut microbiota in

In degenerative joint disease like osteoarthritis (OA), bioactive compounds like 
resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, and other polyphenols often 
target various signalling pathways, including NFκB, TGFβ, and Wnt/β-catenin by 
executing epigenetic-modifying activities. Epigenetic modulation can target 
genes of disease pathophysiology via histone modification, promoter DNA 
methylation, and non-coding RNA expression, some of which are directly involved 
in OA but have been less explored. OA patients often seek options that can 
improve the quality of their life in addition to existing treatment with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although bioactive and natural 
compounds exhibit therapeutic potential against OA, several disadvantages loom, 
like insolubility and poor bioavailability. Nanoformulated bioactive compounds 
promise a better way to alleviate OA since they also control systemic events, 
including metabolic, immunological, and inflammatory responses, by modulating 
host gut microbiota that can regulate OA pathogenesis. Recent data suggest gut 
dysbiosis in OA. However, limited evidence is available on the role of bioactive 
compounds as epigenetic and gut modulators in ameliorating OA. Moreover, it is 
not known whether the effects of polyphenolic bioactive compounds on gut 
microbial response are mediated by epigenetic modulatory activities in OA. This 
narrative review highlights the nanotherapeutic strategies utilizing bioactive 
compounds, reporting their effects on chondrocyte growth, metabolism, and 
epigenetic modifications in osteoarthritis amelioration.

Gut microbial dysbiosis, especially bacteriome, has been implicated in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, nonbacterial members of the gut microbiome in 
AD, such as the mycobiome, archaeome, and virome, are unexplored. Here, we 
perform higher-resolution shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples 
collected longitudinally from a mouse model of AD to investigate longitudinal 
and multi-kingdom gut microbiome profiling. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 
fecal samples from AD mice and healthy mice returns 41,222 bacterial, 414 
fungal, 1836 archaeal, and 1916 viral species across all time points. The 
ecological network pattern of the gut microbiome in AD mice is characterized by 
more complex bacterial-bacterial interactions and fungal-fungal interactions, as 
well as simpler archaeal-archaeal interactions and viral-viral interactions. The 
development of AD is accompanied by multi-kingdom shifts in the gut microbiome 
composition, as evidenced by the identification of 1177 differential bacterial, 
84 differential fungal, 59 differential archaeal, and 10 differential viral 
species between healthy and AD mice across all time points. In addition, the 
functional potential of the gut microbiome is partially altered in the 
development of AD. Collectively, our findings uncover longitudinal and 
multi-kingdom gut microbiome alterations in AD and provide a motivation for 
considering microbiome-based therapeutics during the prevention and treatment of 
AD.

Growth hormone (GH) and gut microbiota are key regulators of metabolism and have 
been linked to the development and treatment of obesity. Although variations in 
GH levels are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition, the 
specific effects of GH on gut microbiota and its role in obesity remain unclear. 
This study explored the effects of various GH doses (0.25, 0.75 and 1.5 IU/kg) 
on adipose tissue mass and gut microbiota in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. 
Notably, high-dose GH (1.5 IU/kg) significantly reduced the adipose tissue mass. 
This dose also reversed high-fat diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, 
restoring microbial diversity and increasing the abundance of beneficial genera 
such as Ruminococcaceae and Muribaculaceae. Additionally, high-dose GH 
normalized several obesity-related gut microbiota pathways, including starch and 
sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis. 
GH therapy also improved intestinal barrier function, a key determinant of gut 
microbial homeostasis. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of GH 
in obesity management through its effects on gut microbiota, providing new 
avenues for obesity interventions.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are 
gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical 
presentations but diverging etiologies. The study aims to decipher CD and 
ITB-associated gut dysbiosis signatures and identify disease-associated 
co-occurring modules to evaluate whether this dysbiosis signature is a 
disease-specific trait or is a shared feature across diseases of diverging 
etiologies.
METHODS: Disease-associated gut microbial modules were identified using 
statistical machine learning and co-abundance network analysis in controls, CD 
and ITB patients recruited as part of this study. Module reproducibility was 
reinvestigated through meta-network analysis encompassing >5400 bacteriomes and 
~900 mycobiomes. Subsequently, >1600 Indian gut microbiomes were analyzed to 
identify a central-core gut microbiome of 46 taxa, whose abundances aided in the 
formulation of an India-specific Core Gut Microbiome Score (CGMS) to measure the 
degree of core retention.
RESULTS: Both diseases witness similar patterns of alterations in 
[alpha]-diversity, characterized by a significant reduction in gut bacterial 
(i.e., bacterial/archaeal) diversity and a concomitant increase in the fungal 
[alpha]-diversity. Specific bacterial taxa, along with the diverging mycobiome 
enabled distinction between the diseases. Co-abundance network analysis of these 
taxa, validated by integrated meta-network analysis, revealed a 
'disease-depleted' module, consistent across multiple cohorts, with >75% of this 
module constituting the central-core Indian gut microbiome. CGMS robustly 
assessed the core-microbiome loss across different stages of gut inflammatory 
disorders, in Indian and international cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: While the disease-specific gain of detrimental bacteria forms an 
important component of gut dysbiosis, loss of the core microbiome is a shared 
phenomenon contributing to various GI disorders.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is linked to host gut dysbiosis. 
Here we performed faecal gut microbiome sequencing to investigate SLE-pathogenic 
gut microbes and their potential mechanisms.
METHODS: There were 134 healthy controls (HCs) and 114 SLE cases for 16 S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and 97 HCs and 124 SLE cases for shotgun 
metagenomics. Faecal microbial changes and associations with clinical phenotypes 
were evaluated, and SLE-associated microbial genera were identified in amplicon 
analysis. Next, metagenomic sequencing was applied for accurate identification 
of microbial species and discovery of their metabolic pathways and immunogenic 
peptides both relevant to SLE. Finally, contribution of specific taxa to disease 
development was confirmed by oral gavage into lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice.
RESULTS: SLE patients had gut microbiota richness reduction and composition 
alteration, particularly lupus nephritis and active patients. 
Proteobacteria/Bacteroidetes (P/B) ratio was remarkably up-regulated, and 
Escherichia was identified as the dominantly expanded genus in SLE, followed by 
metagenomics accurately located Escherichia coli and Escherichia unclassified 
species. Significant associations primarily appeared among Escherichia coli, 
metabolic pathways of purine nucleotide salvage or peptidoglycan maturation and 
SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), and between multiple epitopes from 
Escherichia coli and disease activity or renal involvement phenotype. Finally, 
gavage with faecal Escherichia revealed that it upregulated lupus-associated 
serum traits and aggravated glomerular lesions in MRL/lpr mice.
CONCLUSION: We characterize a novel SLE exacerbating Escherichia outgrowth and 
suggest its contribution to SLE procession may be partially associated with 
metabolite changes and cross-reactivity of gut microbiota-associated epitopes 
and host autoantigens. The findings could provide a deeper insight into gut 
Escherichia in the procession of SLE.

The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia (HUA) and 
gout. However, it remains unclear whether probiotics residing in the host gut, 
such as Lactobacillus, can prevent HUA development. Herein, we isolated 
Lactobacillus plantarum SQ001 from the cecum of HUA geese and conducted in vitro 
assays on uric acid (UA) and nucleoside co-culture. Metabolomics and genome-wide 
analyses, revealed that this strain may promote nucleoside uptake and hydrolysis 
through its nucleoside hydrolase gene. The functional role of iunH gene was 
confirmed via heterologous expression and gene knockout studies. Oral 
administration of L. plantarum SQ001 resulted in increased abundance of 
Lactobacillus species and reduced serum UA levels. Furthermore, it downregulated 
hepatic xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme involved in UA synthesis, as well as 
renal reabsorption protein GLUT9, while enhancing the expression of renal 
excretion protein ABCG2. Our findings suggest that L. plantarum has potential to 
ameliorate gut microbial dysbiosis with HUA, thereby offering insights into its 
potential application as a probiotic therapy for individuals with HUA or gout.

Plain Language Summary: Our blood contains many components, including waste 
products that need to be transported to the kidneys, where they can exit the 
body through urine. One such molecule, known as uric acid, forms when cells 
break down old DNA and other similar molecules. This process has several steps, 
with DNA being broken down into intermediate molecules called nucleosides before 
being converted into uric acid. If the amount of uric acid in the bloodstream 
becomes too high (a condition known as hyperuricemia), humans and other animals 
can develop high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and other illnesses. 
Recent studies suggest that some types of ‘friendly’ bacteria living in the 
human gut may influence how uric acid levels are regulated. But the precise role 
these bacteria play remains unclear. Here, Fu, Luo et al. isolated one of these 
friendly bacterial species, known as Lactobacillus plantarum, from the gut of 
geese with hyperuricemia. The team grew the bacteria in the laboratory in two 
environments: one containing uric acid and the other containing nucleosides. The 
experiments revealed that while Lactobacillus plantarum does not directly act on 
uric acid, it does have enzymes that can convert nucleosides into other 
molecules. Further investigations, using whole-genome and metabolomic analyses, 
showed that Lactobacillus plantarum contains three genes encoding enzymes that 
act on a type of nucleoside known as a purine. Knocking out one of these genes 
prevented the bacteria from being able to convert purines into other molecules. 
Subsequently, Fu, Luo et al. demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum helps to 
mitigate the effects of hyperuricemia in geese and mice. These findings provide 
valuable insights into how microbes living in the gut regulate uric acid levels 
in their hosts. They may also inform future strategies for preventing and 
treating hyperuricemia in humans.

BACKGROUND: The complexity of contexts and varied purposes for which biome 
donation are requested are unknown in South Africa.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide strategic data towards 
actualisation of whether a stool donor bank may be established as a 
collaborative between Western Cape Blood Services (WCBS) and the University of 
Cape Town (UCT).
METHOD: We designed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey to determine 
willingness of WCBS blood donors to donate stool specimens for microbiome 
biobanking. The study was conducted between 01 June 2022 and 01 July 2022 at 
three WCBS donation centres in Cape Town, South Africa. Anonymous blood donors 
who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Anonymised demographic and 
interview data were analysed statistically.
RESULTS: Analysis of responses from 209/231 blood donors demonstrated in a 
logistic regression model that compensation (p < 0.001) and 'societal benefit 
outweighs inconvenience' beliefs (p = 7.751e-05) were covariates significantly 
associated with willingness to donate stool. Age was borderline significant at a 
5% level (p = 0.0556). Most willing stool donors indicated that donating stool 
samples would not affect blood donations (140/157, 90%). Factors decreasing 
willingness to donate were stool collection being unpleasant or embarrassing.
CONCLUSION: The survey provides strategic data for the establishment of a stool 
bank and provided an understanding of the underlying determinants regarding 
becoming potential donors.
CONTRIBUTION: This is the first report on the perspectives of potential 
participants in donating samples towards a stool microbiome biobank in South 
Africa, a necessity for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

BACKGROUND: Prior efforts have revealed changes in gut microbiome, circulating 
metabolome, and multimodal neuroimaging features in cerebral small vessel 
disease (CSVD). However, there is a paucity of research integrating the 
multi-omic information to characterize the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis 
in CSVD.
METHODS: We collected gut microbiome, fecal and blood metabolome, multimodal 
magnetic resonance imaging data from 37 CSVD patients with white matter 
hyperintensities and 46 healthy controls. Between-group comparison was performed 
to identify the differential gut microbial taxa, followed by performance of 
multi-stage microbiome-metabolome-neuroimaging-neuropsychology correlation 
analyses in CSVD patients.
RESULTS: Our data showed both depleted and enriched gut microbes in CSVD 
patients. Among the differential microbes, Haemophilus and Akkermansia were 
associated with a range of metabolites enriched for Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis 
pathway. Furthermore, the affected metabolites were associated with neuroimaging 
measures involving gray matter morphology, spontaneous intrinsic brain activity, 
white matter integrity, and global structural network topology, which were in 
turn related to cognition and emotion in CSVD patients.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide an integrative framework to understand the 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the interplay between gut microbiota 
dysbiosis and CSVD, highlighting the potential of targeting the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis as a therapeutic strategy in CSVD patients.

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract quickly becomes densely populated with 
foreign microorganisms shortly after birth, thereby establishing a lifelong 
presence of a microbial community. These commensal gut microbiota serve various 
functions, such as providing nutrients, processing ingested compounds, 
maintaining gut homeostasis, and shaping the intestinal structure in the host. 
Dysbiosis, which is characterized by an imbalance in the microbial community, is 
closely linked to numerous human ailments and has recently emerged as a key 
factor in health prognosis. Tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious and 
potentially fatal disease, presents a pressing need for improved methods of 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Thus, we aim to explore the 
latest developments on how the host's immune defenses, inflammatory responses, 
metabolic pathways, and nutritional status collectively impact the host's 
susceptibility to or resilience against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. 
The review addresses how the fluctuations in the gut microbiota not only affect 
the equilibrium of these physiological processes but also indirectly influence 
the host's capacity to resist M. tuberculosis. This work highlights the central 
role of the gut microbiota in the host-microbe interactions and provides novel 
insights for the advancement of preventative and therapeutic approaches against 
tuberculosis.

Methanobrevibacter oralis (M. oralis) has predominated human oral microbiota 
methanogenic archaea as far back as the Palaeolithic era in Neanderthal 
populations and gained dominance from the 18th century onwards. M. oralis was 
initially isolated from dental plaque samples collected from two apparently 
healthy individuals allowing its first characterization. The culture of M. 
oralis is fastidious and has been the subject of several studies to improve its 
laboratory growth. Various PCR methods are used to identify M. oralis, targeting 
either the 16S rRNA gene or the mcrA gene. However, only one RTQ-PCR system, 
based on a chaperonin gene, offers specificity, and allows for microbial load 
quantification. Next-generation sequencing contributed five draft genomes, each 
approximately 2.08 Mb (±0.052 Mb) with a 27.82 (±0.104) average GC%, and two 
ancient metagenomic assembled genomes. M. oralis was then detected in various 
oral cavity sites in healthy individuals and those diagnosed with oral 
pathologies, notably periodontal diseases, and endodontic infections. 
Transmission pathways, possibly involving maternal milk and breastfeeding, 
remain to be clarified. M. oralis was further detected in brain abscesses and 
respiratory tract samples, bringing its clinical significance into question. 
This review summarizes the current knowledge about M. oralis, emphasizing its 
prevalence, associations with dysbiosis and pathologies in oral and extra-oral 
situations, and symbiotic relationships, with the aim of paving the way for 
further investigations.

Plain Language Summary: Methanobrevibacter oralis, the most predominant 
methanogen in human oral microbiota, traces back to the Palaeolithic era and 
emerges as the dominant methanogen from the 18th century onwards.Our 
understanding of Methanobrevibacter oralis microbiology remains limited, 
particularly regarding its phenotypic, genomic, and metabolic characteristics. 
Furthermore, specific identification and quantification methods are still 
limited.Although Methanobrevibacter oralis has been found in dysbiotic 
conditions, such as periodontitis, and in other oral and extra-oral pathologies, 
its pathogenicity remains largely understudied and should be the focus of future 
research.

BACKGROUND: Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) pose a formidable 
challenge to healthcare systems worldwide due to their complex pathogenesis, 
significant morbidity, and mortality. Scope and Approach: This comprehensive 
review aims to elucidate the central role of the microbiotagut- brain axis 
(MGBA) in ND pathogenesis. Specifically, it delves into the perturbations within 
the gut microbiota and its metabolomic landscape, as well as the structural and 
functional transformations of the gastrointestinal and blood-brain barrier 
interfaces in ND patients. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive overview of 
the recent advancements in medicinal and dietary interventions tailored to 
modulate the MGBA for ND therapy.
CONCLUSION: Accumulating evidence underscores the pivotal role of the gut 
microbiota in ND pathogenesis through the MGBA. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota 
and associated metabolites instigate structural modifications and augmented 
permeability of both the gastrointestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). These alterations facilitate the transit of microbial molecules from the 
gut to the brain via neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, potentially 
contributing to the etiology of NDs. Numerous investigational strategies, 
encompassing prebiotic and probiotic interventions, pharmaceutical trials, and 
dietary adaptations, are actively explored to harness the microbiota for ND 
treatment. This work endeavors to enhance our comprehension of the intricate 
mechanisms underpinning ND pathogenesis, offering valuable insights for the 
development of innovative therapeutic modalities targeting these debilitating 
disorders.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infects approximately half of the population 
worldwide and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. 
Test-and-treat strategies have been recommended for the prevention of H. 
pylori-associated diseases. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing 
technologies have broadened our understanding of the complex gastrointestinal 
(GI) microbiota and its role in maintaining host homeostasis. Recently, an 
increasing number of studies have indicated that the colonization of H. pylori 
induces dramatic alterations in the gastric microbiota, with a predominance of 
H. pylori and a reduction in microbial diversity. Dysbiosis of the gut 
microbiome has also been observed after H. pylori infection, which may play a 
role in the development of colorectal cancer. However, there is concern 
regarding the impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota during H. pylori 
eradication. In this review, we summarize the current literature concerning how 
H. pylori infection reshapes the GI microbiota and the underlying mechanisms, 
including changes in the gastric environment, immune responses, and persistent 
inflammation. Additionally, the impacts of H. pylori eradication on GI microbial 
homeostasis and the use of probiotics as adjuvant therapy are also discussed. 
The shifts in the GI microbiota and their crosstalk with H. pylori may provide 
potential targets for H. pylori-related gastric diseases and extragastric 
manifestations.

Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease with a robust microbial component 
and numerous correlations with dysbiosis states. Furthermore, various factors 
are recognized as triggers for skin dysbiosis, including the use of certain 
cosmetics. Based on these arguments, we hypothesized that using photoprotective 
formulations could trigger dysbiosis and the occurrence of acne manifestations. 
To verify this assumption, six volunteers between 19 and 23 years of age, 
meeting all the inclusion criteria, received two applications a day of a 
non-commercial sunscreen formulation developed with the sun filters ethylhexyl 
methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl salicylate, methyl anthranilate, and octocrylene 
dispersed in a base gel, with an estimated protection factor of 28.8. The pure 
base gel was used as a control. The samples were applied to an area delimited by 
a standard template (15 cm2) in an amount corresponding to 30 mg (2 mg cm2) for 
ten days. At two points in time, pre- and post-sample applications, the facial 
skin surface was swabbed to collect extracted DNA and processed to verify 
divergent degrees of 16 S RNA coding sequences. The data obtained allowed us to 
determine the abundance of different bacterial entities at the genus and species 
levels. The results showed that critical species of the acne process, such as 
Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, seem to tolerate the 
evaluated formulation well and are not significantly affected by the 
formulation, suggesting no interference of its use concerning dysbiosis 
induction. These findings refute the idea that photoprotectors may cause skin 
dysbiosis in men.

Lymphocystis viral disease (LVD) is a highly transmissible disease known to 
affect multiple fishes worldwide. Although this disease is usually benign, 
mortalities can occur in cases where infection is severe or secondary infection 
with bacterial pathogens and parasites occur. However, little is known about the 
bacterial dynamics of fish with LVD or what bacterial pathogens may be 
responsible for secondary infections. Here we assessed the effects of LVD on the 
skin microbiome of gilthead seabream by comparing 30 symptomatic, asymptomatic 
and recovered (three weeks after infection) fish using 16S rRNA high-throughput 
sequencing. Our results show that LVD is associated with significant changes in 
microbiome structure and function. Importantly, fish pathogens like 
Tenacibaculum maritimum and some Vibrio species increased their abundance. 
Moreover, microbial metabolic activities of the commensal microbiota that may 
confer some protection to fish were suppressed in diseased fish. After reducing 
fish cage density to treat symptoms and three weeks of recovery, the abundance 
of pathogens was significantly reduced and microbiome functionality was 
recovered, although community structure remained significantly different. These 
results show that LVD can severely disrupt the bacterial communities of the skin 
of the gilthead seabream, leading to an increase in bacterial pathogens 
responsible for relevant diseases in gilthead seabream farms.

BACKGROUND: Microbial-derived secondary bile acids (SBAs) are reabsorbed and 
sensed via host receptors modulating cellular inflammation and fibrosis. Feline 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs with progressive renal inflammation and 
fibrosis, mirroring the disease pathophysiology of human CKD patients.
METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study compared healthy cats (n = 6) with 
CKD (IRIS Stage 2 n = 17, Stage 3 or 4 n = 11). Single timepoint fecal samples 
from all cats underwent targeted bile acid metabolomics. 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing using DADA2 with SILVA taxonomy characterized the fecal microbiota.
RESULTS: CKD cats had significantly reduced fecal concentrations (median 
12.8 ng/mg, Mann-Whitney p = 0.0127) of the SBA ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
compared to healthy cats (median 39.4 ng/mg). Bile acid dysmetabolism 
characterized by <50% SBAs was present in 8/28 CKD and 0/6 healthy cats. Beta 
diversity significantly differed between cats with <50% SBAs and > 50% SBAs 
(PERMANOVA p < 0.0001). Twenty-six amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with >97% 
nucleotide identity to Peptacetobacter hiranonis were identified. P. hiranonis 
combined relative abundance was significantly reduced (median 2.1%) in CKD cats 
with <50% SBAs compared to CKD cats with >50% SBAs (median 13.9%, adjusted 
p = 0.0002) and healthy cats with >50% SBAs (median 15.5%, adjusted p = 0.0112). 
P. hiranonis combined relative abundance was significantly positively correlated 
with the SBAs deoxycholic acid (Spearman r = 0.5218, adjusted p = 0.0407) and 
lithocholic acid (Spearman r = 0.5615, adjusted p = 0.0156). Three 
Oscillospirales ASVs and a Roseburia ASV were also identified as significantly 
correlated with fecal SBAs.
CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMPORTANCE: The gut-kidney axis mediated through 
microbial-derived SBAs appears relevant to the spontaneous animal CKD model of 
domestic cats. This includes reduced fecal concentrations of the 
microbial-derived SBA UDCA, known to regulate inflammation and fibrosis and be 
reno-protective. Microbes correlated with fecal SBAs include bai operon 
containing P. hiranonis, as well as members of Oscillospirales, which also 
harbor a functional bai operon. Ultimately, CKD cats represent a translational 
opportunity to study the role of SBAs in the gut-kidney axis, including the 
potential to identify novel microbial-directed therapeutics to mitigate CKD 
pathogenesis in veterinary patients and humans alike.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide despite advances in medical research and therapeutics. 
Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of the gut-brain axis, a complex 
communication network involving the gut microbiota, central nervous system, and 
cardiovascular system, in modulating cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota 
influences systemic inflammation, neurohumoral pathways, and metabolic 
processes, which are critical in the pathogenesis of CVD. Dysbiosis, or an 
imbalance in the gut microbiota, has been implicated in various cardiovascular 
conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. This 
comprehensive review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between the 
gut microbiome, brain, and cardiovascular system, highlighting the mechanisms by 
which gut-derived signals affect cardiovascular function. Key microbial 
metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-oxide 
(TMAO), and their impact on vascular health and blood pressure regulation are 
discussed. Furthermore, the review explores potential therapeutic strategies 
targeting the gut-brain axis, including probiotics, prebiotics, dietary 
modifications, and pharmacological interventions, to improve cardiovascular 
outcomes. Despite promising findings, the field faces challenges such as 
individual variability in microbiome composition, complexities in gut-brain 
interactions, and the need for robust clinical trials to establish causality. 
Addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary research could pave the 
way for innovative, personalized therapeutic approaches. This review provides a 
comprehensive understanding of the gut-brain-cardiovascular axis, underscoring 
its potential as a novel target for preventing and treating CVD.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a gastrointestinal condition 
characterized by abnormal colonization of bacteria in the small intestine, 
leading to overgrowth and alteration, which is linked to gastrointestinal 
issues, potentially affecting neurological and mental health. Despite existing 
research, we still do not understand how SIBO affects tryptophan metabolism and 
psychiatric diseases. We investigated the literature for connections between 
SIBO, tryptophan metabolism disruptions, and psychiatric disorders like autism, 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. We also explored the 
interaction between thyroid disorders and their influence on SIBO and 
psychiatric illnesses. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using 
keywords and phrases, individual and in combinations, like "SIBO," "gut 
microbiota," "neurologic disorders," "mental disorders," "tryptophan," 
"dopamine," and "thyroid disease." We focused on original research and review 
papers that presented empirical studies conducted on animal models and human 
subjects published in English between February 1992 to February 2023. The 
initial 2 634 534 records were preliminary screened based on title and abstract 
and then subjected to full-text review to exclude publications with insufficient 
data on SIBO, lack of a psychiatric disorder component, or methodological 
limitations compromising the integrity of the findings. The analysis highlights 
the significance of the association between psychiatric disorders and SIBO, 
emphasizing the role of gut-microbial diversity in mental health. We advocate 
for more detailed studies, including longitudinal research, to clarify the 
causal relationships between SIBO, gut dysbiosis, and psychiatric disorders and 
for an integrated approach while treating complex psychiatric conditions.
