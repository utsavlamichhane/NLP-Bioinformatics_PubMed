BACKGROUND: Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pan-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 
inhibitor, ameliorates multiple pathological conditions and tissue injury and 
shows strong potential for clinical applications. Here, we investigated the 
preventive effects of DCA in a murine model of alcohol-associated liver disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the acute-on-chronic model of 
alcohol-associated liver disease and treated with DCA. Livers were assessed in 
liver histology, biochemistry, and gene expression. Mass spectrometry was used 
to compare protein expression and metabolite levels.
RESULTS: DCA inhibited hepatic expression of inflammatory genes but did not 
prevent steatosis and hepatocellular injury in ethanol-fed mice. Consistently, 
DCA repressed the expression of mRNAs for inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated 
murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human monocytic THP-1 cells and 
inhibited both gene expression and protein release of interleukin-1 beta. DCA 
prevented hepatic accumulation of isovaleric acid in ethanol-fed mice, a 
short-chain fatty acid primarily produced by gut microbiota. In vitro, 
isovaleric acid potentiated LPS's effects, while DCA prevented this 
proinflammatory action. Ethanol feeding increased the expression of proteins 
involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including branched-chain amino acid 
(BCAA) degradation. In ethanol-fed mice, hepatic Fischer's ratio (the molar 
ratio of BCAAs to aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr) and BTR (the molar ratio of 
BCAAs to Tyr) showed a decrease compared to pair-fed mice; however, this 
decrease was not observed in DCA-treated ethanol-fed mice. DCA blunted the 
ethanol-induced increase of BCKDHA, the rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism, 
and cytochrome P450 2E1.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol-induced hepatic inflammatory responses and metabolic 
disturbances were prevented by DCA in mice, indicating the potential to develop 
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors as an effective therapy to treat 
alcohol-associated liver disease.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a heterogenous group of diseases with an yet unknown 
exact pathogenesis. An interplay between genetic predispositionw (mainly 
HLA-B*27 positivity), a barrier leakage (of skin and gut) and environmental 
influences, such as the contact to certain microbiota are suspected to lead to 
an activation of the immune system and through this to the development and 
maintenance of the disease.

Publisher: Die Spondyloarthritiden (SpA) umfassen eine heterogene Gruppe von

ein Zusammenspiel zwischen genetischer Prädisposition (v. a. HLA-B*27 
Positivität), einer Barrierestörung (u. a. von Haut und Darm) und 
Umwelteinflüsse wie der Kontakt zu bestimmten Mikrobiota über eine Aktivierung

BACKGROUND: Asthma, a prevalent chronic inflammatory respiratory disease among 
children, was the focus of this study. Serum metabolism profiles were examined 
in patients diagnosed with both asthma and bronchiolitis by using ultra-high 
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
METHODS: In this study, the serum samples from three distinct groups-comprising 
patients diagnosed with asthma, bronchiolitis, and a healthy control 
group-underwent comprehensive non-targeted metabolomics analysis and targeted 
eicosanoid profiling.
RESULTS: Through both univariate and multivariate analyses, significant 
associations were observed between the pathophysiology of both asthma and 
bronchiolitis and aberrations in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
amino acids, purines, and pathways involving cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, 
indicative of inflammatory processes and immune responses. Furthermore, 
metabolic changes in phosphatidylethanolamine, saturated and monounsaturated 
fatty acids, and bile acids were observed in the asthma group. Bronchiolitis was 
distinguished by disruptions in acyl carnitine and phosphatidylcholine 
metabolism.
CONCLUSION: This study offers a new perspective on understanding the interplay 
of pathogenic mechanisms underlying both asthma and bronchiolitis. Its findings 
are significant for enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored 
to asthma stemming from bronchiolitis.

BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest a potential link between intestinal flora and 
acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the causal relationships between specific 
intestinal flora and AP, and the possible mediating role of immune cell traits, 
remain unclear.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 5,959 participants was 
conducted to identify genetic instrumental variables associated with 473 
intestinal flora taxa. Summary statistics for AP were obtained from the UK 
Biobank. Immune cell traits were also identified using large-scale GWAS summary 
data. We employed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach to investigate the causal relationships between intestinal flora, 
immune cell traits, and AP, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary 
statistical method. Sensitivity analyses, including the MR-Egger intercept test, 
Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO test, and leave-one-out test, were conducted to 
assess the robustness of our findings. Additionally, we explored whether immune 
cell traits mediate the pathway from intestinal flora to AP.
RESULTS: 11 positive and 11 negative causal relationships were identified 
between genetic susceptibility in intestinal flora and AP. Furthermore, 19 
positive and 9 negative causal relationships were observed between immune cell 
traits and AP. Notably, CD38 mediated the causal relationship between Bacillus C 
and AP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to uncover novel causal relationships 
between various intestinal flora and acute pancreatitis, emphasizing the 
mediating role of immune cell traits in the pathway from intestinal flora to AP. 
It also provides new evidence supporting the conditional pathogenicity of the 
Bacillus genus.

Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is not well understood 
in relation to the microbiome. Our objective was to demonstrate changes in the 
microbiota and the relationships between nutrients in children with celiac 
disease (CD) who followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). A group of 11 children who 
were recently diagnosed with CD, ranging in age from 3 to 12, were monitored for 
a period of 6 months. GFD is designed based on the individual's specific energy 
and nutrient needs, with strict control over dietary adherence. Food 
consumption, blood, and fecal samples were taken. Fecal samples were put through 
16s rRNA sequencing. Microbial modifications were demonstrated using alpha 
diversity, beta diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NDMS), 
t-test, and metastats. Mean age was 6.4 ± 2.66 years and 54.5% were male 
participants. Serological parameters were negative after 6 months. Both 
unweighted (p = .019) and weighted (p = .021) Unifrac distances were higher 
before GFD, and differences were reliable according to NDMS analysis 
(stress = 0.189). The abundance of Bacteroides ovatus was increased (p = .014), 
whereas unidentified Lachnospiraceae, Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium 
Peptostreptococcus, and Dielma were decreased after GFD (p < .001). Associations 
between nutrients and several genera and species were identified. The presence 
of genus Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was inversely 
associated with fat intake after GFD (p < .01). Microbiota changes became 
evident over a period of 6 months. The presence or absence of small bacteria may 
play a role in the development of CD. Modifying the children's dietary intake 
can potentially influence the microbial composition.

The gut serves as the body's main immunological and digestive system. 
Furthermore, host immunity is mostly managed there. Nutrients are further broken 
down and absorbed here. Numerous research investigations have shown evidence 
that inflammation, oxidative stress, impairment of the intestinal barrier, and 
imbalance in the gut microbiota can all contribute to a variety of intestinal 
illnesses and other issues, underscoring the growing significance of intestinal 
health concerns. Because of their high biological activity and lack of negative 
side effects, the organic food-derived chemicals known as brown algal 
polysaccharides-mainly fucoidan, laminaran, and alginate-have attracted a lot of 
attention from academics. Because of its many benefits, sodium alginate is one 
of the biopolymers that has garnered the greatest attention, research, and 
application. Carotenoids, which are found in our food, have several positive 
health effects. Their low solubility in water, oxidation susceptibility, 
chemical instability, accessibility, and restricted solubility in water, 
however, restrict their use in food and medicine. In this review and in 
overcoming these constraints, encapsulation might be helpful. Furthermore, the 
primary goal of our study is to provide a fresh perspective into the control and 
avoidance of intestinal diseases. It provides more potent alternatives to this 
system, clarifies the function of alginates in enhancing the encapsulation of 
carotenoids, and functions as a model for the synthesis of the intestinal 
protective agent fucoidan.

Sarcopenia, as a disease characterized by progressive decline of quality, 
strength, and function of muscles, has posed an increasingly significant threat 
to the health of middle-aged and elderly individuals in recent years. With the 
continuous deepening of studies, the concept of gut-muscle axis has attracted 
widespread attention worldwide, and the occurrence and development of sarcopenia 
are believed to be closely related to the composition and functional alterations 
of gut microbiota. In this review, combined with existing literatures and 
clinical reports, we have summarized the role and impacts of gut microbiota on 
the muscle, the relevance between gut microbiota and sarcopenia, potential 
mechanisms of gut microbiota in the modulation of sarcopenia, potential methods 
to alleviate sarcopenia by modulating gut microbiota, and relevant advances and 
perspectives, thus contributing to adding more novel knowledge to this research 
direction and providing certain reference for future related studies.

This systematic review investigates the association between environmental 
pollutants and the risk of diarrhea, a critical public health issue, 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The review synthesizes 
findings from various studies that highlight the impact of contaminants such as 
pesticides, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
microplastics, and parabens on gastrointestinal health. Following PRISMA 
guidelines, a comprehensive literature search across databases including PubMed, 
Scopus, and Google Scholar yielded 496 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion 
criteria for detailed analysis. The results indicate a significant correlation 
between exposure to specific pollutants-particularly pesticides like 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PAHs, arsenic, cadmium, and 
microplastics-and increased incidences of diarrhea. Notably, studies revealed 
that prenatal exposure to DDT is linked to higher diarrhea rates among boys in 
urban settings, while pesticide exposure in childhood correlates with 
inflammatory bowel disease in adulthood. Mechanistically, these pollutants may 
disrupt gastrointestinal function through cholinergic effects and endocrine 
disruption, leading to altered gut motility and microbiome imbalances. Moreover, 
the review emphasizes the immunosuppressive effects of heavy metals such as 
mercury and cadmium, which compromise the immune response and increase 
susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections. Despite the identified 
associations, there is a notable gap in research regarding geographic 
distribution and pollutant impacts on health outcomes. The review underscores 
the necessity for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to 
these environmental pollutants to mitigate their adverse health effects. In 
conclusion, this systematic review highlights the urgent need for further 
epidemiological studies in underrepresented areas to enhance our understanding 
of how environmental pollutants influence public health globally. 
Recommendations include rigorous monitoring of pollutant levels, public health 
initiatives to reduce exposure, and policies that restrict emissions of harmful 
substances. Addressing environmental pollution is crucial for mitigating 
diarrheal diseases and protecting vulnerable populations from its detrimental 
effects.

Plain Language Summary: Environmental polluatants (metals and non metals) are 
involved in diarrhea.

Many systemic diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and cardiovascular disease, are associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The oral 
and intestinal microbiota are directly connected anatomically, and communicate 
with each other through the oral-gut microbiome axis to establish and maintain 
host microbial homeostasis. In addition to directly, periodontal bacteria may 
also be indirectly involved in the regulation of systemic health and disease 
through the disturbed gut. This paper provides evidence for the role of 
periodontal bacteria in systemic diseases via the oral-gut axis and the 
far-reaching implications of maintaining periodontal health in reducing the risk 
of many intestinal and parenteral diseases. This may provide insight into the 
underlying pathogenesis of many systemic diseases and the search for new 
preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is a major complication of diabetes 
that markedly affects the quality of life and health status of patients. Recent 
studies have investigated the potential regulatory influence of gut flora and 
bile acids on DPNP via the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway. Dysbiosis of the gut 
flora not only directly affects bile acid metabolism but also significantly 
correlates with diabetes-associated neuropathy through interactions with the 
bile acid receptor TGR5 and the ion channel TRPV1. This review describes how 
alterations in the gut flora and bile acid metabolism contribute to the 
pathogenesis of DPNP through the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway, revealing 
potential applications for this pathway in DPNP management. Furthermore, 
experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the modulation of gut flora 
and bile acid metabolism as well as targeting the TGR5/TRPV1 signaling pathway 
as an innovative therapeutic approach. Further studies are warranted to 
elucidate the underlying mechanism and develop treatment modalities based on gut 
flora regulation and signaling pathway interventions, thus providing novel 
insights and approaches for DPNP therapy.

The role of GABA in type 1 diabetes.

Mick GJ(1), McCormick KL(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, 
AL, United States.

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic 
decarboxylase (GAD). The entero-pancreatic biology of GABA, which is produced by 
pancreatic islets, GAD-expressing microbiota, enteric immune cells, or ingested 
through diet, supports an essential physiologic role of GABA in the health and 
disease. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is uniquely concentrated 
in pancreatic β-cells. They express GAD65, which is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
autoantigen. Glutamate constitutes 10% of the amino acids in dietary protein and 
is preeminently concentrated in human milk. GABA is enriched in many foods, such 
as tomato and fermented cheese, and is an over-the-counter supplement. Selected 
microbiota in the midgut have the enzymatic capacity to produce GABA. Intestinal 
microbiota interact with gut-associated lymphoid tissue to maintain host 
defenses and immune tolerance, which are implicated in autoimmune disease. 
Although GABA is a widely known inhibitory neurotransmitter, oral GABA does not 
cross the blood brain barrier. Three diabetes-related therapeutic actions are 
ascribed to GABA, namely, increasing pancreatic β-cell content, attenuating 
excess glucagon and tamping down T-cell immune destruction. These salutary 
actions have been observed in numerous rodent diabetes models that usually 
employed high or near-continuous GABA doses. Clinical studies, to date, have 
identified positive effects of oral GABA on peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
cytokine release and plasma glucagon. Going forward, it is reassuring that oral 
GABA therapy has been well-tolerated and devoid of serious adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LRa05, as an adjunct to the treatment of acute 
watery diarrhea in children.
METHODS: Eligible diarrheal children were randomized into intervention group 
(IG, n = 57) and control group (CG, n = 54), and given probiotics or placebo, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The total duration of diarrhea in the IG (121.4 ± 13.7 h) was 
significantly shorter than that in the CG (143.9 ± 19.8 h, p < 0.001). More 
children in the IG showed improvements in diarrhea than those in the CG for both 
per protocol analysis (70.2 vs. 46.3%, p = 0.01) and intention-to-treat analysis 
(66.7 vs. 41.7%, p = 0.003). The LL-37 levels in the IG was markedly higher than 
that in the CG after the intervention (4349.35 ± 1143.86 pg./g vs. 
3682.49 ± 869.21 pg./g, p = 0.039). The intervention led to higher abundance of 
Bifidobacterium longum and lower abundance of Enterococcus faecium, 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bacteroides fragilis (p < 0.05). LRa05 treatment 
upregulated the functional genes of gut microbiota involving immunity 
regulation.
DISCUSSION: Administration of the Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LRa05 at a dose 
of 5 × 109 CFU/day to children aged 0-3 years resulted in shorter duration of 
diarrhea, faster improvement in fecal consistency, and beneficial changes in gut 
microbiome composition and gene functions.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study has been approved and registered 
in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Center with the registration number 
of ChiCTR2100053700 (https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=141082).

Polysaccharides are one of the important components of the human diet, offering 
a wide range of biological activities, especially in improving inflammation in 
the digestive system and addressing metabolic diseases. Among all the reported 
bioactivities of polysaccharides, their regulation effects on intestinal 
function and bile acids (BAs) are gradually attracting the attention of more 
researchers. Bile acids, the main components of intestinal lipid digestive 
fluid, are also key signal factors for metabolic homeostasis and impact overall 
health. Polysaccharides usually interact directly or indirectly with the gut and 
gut microbiota to participate in the regulation process of reabsorption, 
metabolism, and excretion of bile acids in humans, thereby exerting their role 
in the intervention of human diseases. In this review, we comprehensively 
reviewed the effects of bioactive polysaccharides on the regulation of 
intestinal function and bile acids. The chemical structures, bioactivities, and 
potential mechanisms for their activities were also reviewed. This study aimed 
to provide a comprehensive reference for future research on the activities and 
mechanisms of polysaccharides, as well as to offer important strategies and 
insights for the development of bioactive polysaccharides to prevent 
inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

Dietary sanguinarine (SAN) can enhance the growth performance of poultry and 
livestock, but the regulatory mechanism of the SAN monomer on intestinal 
homeostasis and how it promotes growth performance has not yet been clarified. 
In this study, 200 chickens were divided into four groups and fed different 
doses of SAN (0, 0.225, 0.75, 2.25 mg/kg) for transcriptome and microbiota 
analysis. The data showed that different doses of SAN supplementation increased 
the feed conversion rate (FCR) of 22 to 42 d old and 1 to 42 d old broilers 
(P < 0.01), and 0.225 mg/kg SAN reduced the contents of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CREA) and blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) in serum (P < 0.01). Dietary SAN increased the villus height and 
the villus height/crypt depth (V/C) ratio in the ileum (P < 0.01). The levels of 
tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, occludin and claudin-1) were 
up-regulated in the ileum and cecum (P < 0.01) and the levels of immunoglobulin 
(Ig) A, IgM, IgG, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-γ were 
up-regulated in the serum and ileum (P < 0.01). RNA-seq analysis revealed 385 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (|log2 fold change| ≥ 1, FDR < 0.05) 
between the SAN group and CON group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
pathway analysis showed 15 pathways mostly associated with the immune system. 
Additionally, the reverse transcription-PCR results showed that the relative 
mRNA expression of β-defensin and mucin 2 were up-regulated (P < 0.01) and 
Toll-like receptor (TLR 2 and TLR 4) mRNA expression were down-regulated by SAN 
(P < 0.01), which was consistent with the transcriptomic analysis. Western blot 
analysis also showed that SAN reduced the expression of inflammatory proteins 
such as TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B and IL-1β in the ileum (P < 0.01). In 
addition, at the genus level, SAN significantly increased the relative abundance 
of bacteria (Bacteroides, unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus and 
Romboutsia) involved in acetate and butyrate production in the cecum, which are 
associated with enhanced intestinal immune function and maintaining intestinal 
health. In conclusion, SAN ameliorates the growth performance of broilers, 
enhances intestinal immune function, regulates the structure of microbiota and 
maintains intestinal health.

INTRODUCTION: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve 
chronic diseases. Probiotics have been found to have similar effects. However, 
the additive effects of HIIT in combination with probiotics supplementation are 
unclear. The aim of current study was to investigate whether there were additive 
effects when implementing both HIIT and probiotics simultaneously.
METHODS: Forty-seven obese middle-aged women (Age: 44.5 ± 5.94 years, body fat 
percentage: 40.0 ± 4.1%) were recruited and assigned into four groups: control 
group (C, n = 12), probiotics group (P, n = 12), HIIT group (H, n = 11), and 
HIIT with probiotics group (HP, n = 12). All the participants consumed 
probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TWK10, 6 × 1010 CFU/day) or placebo 
supplements daily. Exercise intervention groups conducted HIIT training (85-90% 
vVO2max for 2 min, followed by a 1-min inactive rest interval, repeated for 7 
cycles) 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. Anthropometry, cardiorespiratory 
endurance, blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 
the 8-week intervention.
RESULTS: After the intervention, there were significant changes between groups 
in the variations and rates of change in waist circumference, hip circumference, 
and TTE. The waist circumference in group H significantly increased compared to 
groups C and P, while group HP did not show significant difference compared to 
group C. On the other hand, the hip circumference decreased significantly in 
group HP compared to group C, and the decreased rate in group HP was 
significantly greater than in groups C and P. Furthermore, the increase rates in 
TTE were higher in group H and HP compared to group C.
CONCLUSION: HIIT improves TTE but negatively affects waist circumference 
compared to the control group. However, when combined with probiotics, the 
probiotics not only help enhance TTE but also counteract the negative impact on 
waist circumference and further reduce hip circumference, resulting in a 
synergistic effect.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is 
a growing health concern and the risk of its development is connected with the 
increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which occurs as a result of 
some complex obesity-induced metabolic changes. It is a common chronic liver 
disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, the tendency 
to progress to more severe forms, and a corresponding increase in morbidity and 
mortality. Thus, effectively addressing the rising burden of the disease 
requires a thorough understanding of its complex interrelationship with obesity 
and MetS.
MAIN BODY: MASLD results from complex interactions involving obesity, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidaemia, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, and is 
influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as diet and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis. It has extensive metabolic and non-metabolic implications, 
including links to MetS components like hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and 
dyslipidaemia, and progresses to significant liver damage and other 
extra-hepatic risks like cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Diagnosis 
often relies on imaging and histology, with non-invasive methods preferred over 
liver biopsies. Emerging biomarkers and OMIC technologies offer improved 
diagnostic capabilities but face practical challenges. Advancements in 
artificial intelligence (AI), lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological 
treatments show promise, with future efforts focusing on precision medicine and 
novel diagnostic tools to improve patient outcome.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development 
of MASLD within the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is essential for 
identifying potential therapeutic targets. Advancements in non-invasive 
diagnostic tools and novel pharmacological treatments, hold promise for 
improving the management of MASLD. Future research should focus on precision 
medicine and innovative therapies to effectively address the disease and its 
consequences.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive loss of motor neurons. 
Recent insights into ALS pathogenesis underscore the pivotal role of the gut 
microbiome, prompting an investigation into the potential therapeutic impact of 
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on sporadic ALS patients.
METHODS: Conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
randomized clinical trial, the study enrolled 27 participants from October 2022 
to April 2023. The participants were followed up for 6 months from February 2023 
to October 2023, during in-person visits at baseline, week 15, week 23, and week 
35. The participants, evenly randomized, received either healthy donor FMT (FMT, 
n = 14) or a mixture of 0.9% saline and food coloring (E150c) as sham 
transplantation (placebo, n = 13). The primary outcome measured the change in 
the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score from baseline to 
week 35. Secondary outcomes included changes in gastrointestinal and respiratory 
functions, muscle strength, autonomic function, cognition, quality of life, 
intestinal microbiome composition, and plasm neurofilament light chain protein 
(NFL). Efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat 
population.
RESULTS: A total of 27 randomized patients (47% women; mean age, 67.2 years), 24 
participants completed the entire study. Notably, ALSFRS-R score changes 
exhibited no significant differences between FMT (6.1 [SD, 3.11]) and placebo 
(6.41[SD, 2.73]) groups from baseline to week 35. Secondary efficacy outcomes, 
encompassing respiratory function, muscle strength, autonomic function, 
cognition, quality of life, and plasm NFL, showed no significant differences. 
Nevertheless, the FMT group exhibited improvements in constipation, depression, 
and anxiety symptoms. FMT induced a shift in gut microbiome community 
composition, marked by increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, which persisted 
until week 15 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.28; p = 0.01). Gastrointestinal adverse events 
were the primary manifestations of FMT-related side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical trial involving 27 sporadic ALS patients, FMT did 
not significantly slow the decline in ALSFRS-R score. Larger multicenter 
trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of FMT in sporadic ALS patients and to 
explore the underlying biological mechanisms.

In 2023, the World Obesity Atlas Federation concluded that more than 50% of the 
world's population would be overweight or obese within the next 12 years. At the 
heart of this epidemic lies the gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem that 
profoundly influences obesity-related metabolic health. Its multifaced role 
encompasses energy harvesting, inflammation, satiety signaling, gut barrier 
function, gut-brain communication, and adipose tissue homeostasis. Recognizing 
the complexities of the cross-talk between host physiology and gut microbiota is 
crucial for developing cutting-edge, microbiome-targeted therapies to address 
the global obesity crisis and its alarming health and economic repercussions. 
This narrative review analyzed the current state of knowledge, illuminating 
emerging research areas and their implications for leveraging gut microbial 
manipulations as therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat obesity and related 
disorders in humans. By elucidating the complex relationship between gut 
microflora and obesity, we aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge 
underpinning this critical field, potentially paving the way for novel 
interventions to combat the worldwide obesity epidemic.

Depression is a prevalent mental disorder with an increasing economic burden, 
and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Given the emerging evidence 
linking gut microbiota to mental health, a better understanding of microbial 
profiles associated with depression is necessary. Here, we explore the 
association between gut microbiota and depression by utilizing 16S rRNA amplicon 
sequencing and depression assessment scales, including the Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The study cohort 
consisted of 46 subjects, categorized into depression and normal groups based on 
medical diagnoses and depression scale scores. Our analyses revealed that 
HDRS-based classification better identified distinct gut microbiota structures 
associated with depression than medical diagnoses alone. Notably, lower beta 
diversity was observed in individuals with depression, indicating a more 
homogeneous gut microbial community. By employing both HDRS and BDI scores 
simultaneously, we identified specific taxa, such as Bilophila and Alistipes, 
which are linked to depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the potential 
of using depression assessment scales in conjunction with gut microbiota data to 
advance our understanding of depression and inform future treatment strategies.

The skin and gut microbiota are crucial to amphibians. Triadimefon (TF), a 
widely used triazole fungicide, controls crop diseases and regulates growth, 
with uncertain effects on amphibian microbiota. Contamination, typically 
involving mixed chemicals at low concentrations, including cadmium (Cd) and TF, 
may detrimentally affect amphibian growth, survival, and microbiota health in 
both the skin and gut, but few research has examined these consequences. This 
research examines the impact of Cd and TF on Rana dybowskii tadpoles, focusing 
on survival, body mass, and microbiome changes over 28 days across four groups: 
control, Cd, TF, and Cd + TF groups. Results showed significant reductions in 
survival and body mass in Cd and TF-treated groups, with the combination group 
being the most affected. Microbiota analysis revealed significant dysbiosis in 
both gut and skin microbiomes under pollutant stress, with a marked microbiota 
and a shift in dominant microbial communities. Function prediction analysis 
based on the microbiome composition highlighted significant differences across 
various biological pathways, including metabolism, immune system, environmental 
adaptation, and disease resistance. These alterations suggest that pollutant 
exposure compromises the tadpoles' ability to maintain homeostasis and resist 
pathogens. In conclusion, this study reveals the detrimental effects of Cd and 
TF on the survival, growth, and microbiomes of R. dybowskii tadpoles, indicating 
significant environmental and health risks.

The relationship between the gut microbiome and ocular health has garnered 
increasing attention within the scientific community. Recent research has 
focused on the gut-eye axis, examining whether imbalances within the gut 
microbiome can influence the development, progression and severity of ocular 
diseases, including dry eye disease, uveitis, and glaucoma. Dysbiosis within the 
gut microbiome is linked to immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and 
epithelial barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to ocular pathology. 
This review synthesises current evidence on these associations, exploring how 
gut microbiome alterations drive disease mechanisms. Furthermore, it examines 
the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, including 
antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation, all 
of which aim to restore microbial balance and modulate immune responses. As the 
prevalence of these conditions continues to rise, a deeper understanding of the 
gut-eye axis may facilitate the development of novel, targeted therapies to 
address unmet needs in the management of ocular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Precision nutrition is based on the integration of individual´s 
phenotypical and biological characteristics including genetic variants, 
epigenetic marks, gut microbiota profiles and metabolites fingerprints as well 
as medical history, lifestyle practices, and environmental and cultural factors. 
Thus, nutriomics areas including Nutrigenomics, Nutrigenetics, Nutriepigenetics, 
Nutrimetabolomics, and Nutrimetagenomics have emerged to comprehensively 
understand the complex interactions between nutrients, diet, and the human 
body's molecular processes through precision nutrition.
SUMMARY: This document from the Ibero-American Network of Nutriomics and 
Precision Nutrition (RINN22; https://rinn22.com/) provides a comprehensive 
overview of the concepts of precision nutrition approaches to guide their 
application in clinical and public health as well as establish the position of 
RINN22 regarding the current and future state of precision nutrition.
KEY MESSAGES: The progress and participation of nutriomics to precision 
nutrition is an essential pillar for addressing diet-related diseases and 
developing innovative managing strategies, which will be promoted by advances in 
bioinformatics, machine learning and integrative software as well as the 
description of specific novel biomarkers. In this context, synthesizing and 
critically evaluating the latest developments, potential applications and future 
needs in the field of nutrition is necessary with a holistic perspective, 
incorporating progress in omics technologies aimed at precision nutrition 
interventions. This approach must address and confront healthy, social, food 
security, physically active lifestyle, sanitation and sustainability challenges 
with preventive, participatory, and predictive strategies of personalized, 
population and planetary nutrition for a precision tailored health.

Microplastic (MP) pollution prevalent in freshwater environments and jeopardizes 
the organisms living there. Dozens of studies have been conducted to investigate 
the harmful effects of microplastics on organisms. However, the most diverse and 
sensitive aquatic insects are often overlooked, also there is a lack of a 
comprehensive research exploring the toxicity of microplastics. Here, taking the 
damselfly larvae (Ischnura elegans) as the subject, we investigated the effects 
of different concentration levels of polystyrene microplastics (PS MPs) on their 
physiological characters, behavioristics, metabolomics and transcriptomics, as 
well as gut microbiome. The results showed that the PS MPs had no significant 
effects on the body weight and survival rate, but led to behavioral inhibition. 
Furthermore, expression levels of some metabolites altered, such as nicotinic 
acid, fumaric acid, and stearic acid. Meanwhile, the pathways related to 
oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism were upregulated at the 
transcriptomic level. Moreover, there was a modification of the gut microbial 
community, with an increase in species richness but a shift towards potentially 
harmful bacteria. Our findings suggested that exposure to PS MPs affected the 
overall health of damselfly larvae. Therefore, effective management of MPs to 
minimize their environmental input is crucial in reducing health risks to 
aquatic organisms.

Functional constipation (FC) is a common digestive disorder that affects 
patients' quality of life and is closely associated with intestinal tumors. This 
study used a cross-sectional design to assess the changes of intestinal flora 
and metabolites in different severities of FC patients through 16S rRNA 
sequencing and metabolomics analysis. Results showed that patients with severe 
FC had significantly higher clinical and anxiety scores compared to those in the 
mild and moderate groups. The species richness of intestinal microorganisms in 
the severe FC group was also significantly higher, and obvious differences in 
the flora composition existed. Specifically, the Bacteroidota was more abundant 
in the severe FC group, which was a characteristic feature distinguishing severe 
FC. Metabolomic analyses also revealed metabolite differences among patients 
with mild-to-moderate and severe FC, with the severe FC group showing increased 
enrichment in L-isoleucine biosynthesis and glycolysis metabolic pathways. The 
short-chain fatty acid-targeted metabolome suggested that a decrease in butyric 
acid might be related to worsening constipation. This study suggests that 
specific flora and metabolic pathways could serve as potential diagnostic and 
therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the development of new diagnostic 
and therapeutic approaches to improve the quality of life and therapeutic 
outcomes for FC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a major 
public health concern despite a significant decline in HIV-related mortality and 
morbidity. These significant advances are linked mostly to effective 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, these treatments are not without 
consequences on other microorganisms in our body, especially when they must be 
used for life. Balanced gut microbiota is essential for maintaining human health 
through symbiotic relationship with the host cells.
AIMS AND METHODOLOGY: This review focuses on ART and its potential impact on the 
intestinal microbial population of HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, we 
retrieved studies focusing on the impact of HIV ART on the gut microbiota, that 
were published from 2010 to 2021.
RESULTS: It was observed that most studies on HIV ART and associated gut 
microbiota have been cross-sectional, and the findings, in general, showed 
significant damages caused by the ART to the gut microbial community 
(dysbiosis), with the impact varying in different studies. These changes also 
revealed dysfunction in microbial translocation and some immune markers, 
including T lymphocyte rates and the overall inflammation balance.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant gaps in our understanding of the impact of 
HIV ART on gut microbiota. Thus, a longitudinal study is likely needed with a 
considerable sample size from different settings and classes of ART to better 
understand the impact of HIV ART on the gut microbiota, and develop remedial 
(restorative) and adjunctive host-directed strategies during HIV ART.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that microbial communities differ in 
obese and lean individuals, and dietary fiber can help reduce obesity-related 
conditions through diet-gut microbiota interactions. However, the mechanisms by 
which dietary fibers shape the gut microbiota still need to be elucidated. In 
this in vitro study, we examined how apple fibers affect lean and obese 
microbial communities on a global scale. We employed a high-throughput 
micro-matrix bioreactor system and a multi-omics approach to identify the key 
microorganisms and metabolites involved in this process.
RESULTS: Initially, metagenomics and metabolomics data indicated that obese and 
lean microbial communities had distinct starting microbial communities. We found 
that obese microbial community had different characteristics, including higher 
levels of Ruminococcus bromii and lower levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
along with an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio. Afterward, we exposed 
obese and lean microbial communities to an apple as a representative complex 
food matrix, apple pectin as a soluble fiber, and cellulose as an insoluble 
fiber. Dietary fibers, particularly apple pectin, reduced Acidaminococcus 
intestini and boosted Megasphaera and Akkermansia in the obese microbial 
community. Additionally, these fibers altered the production of metabolites, 
increasing beneficial indole microbial metabolites. Our results underscored the 
ability of apple and apple pectin to shape the obese gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: We found that the obese microbial community had higher 
branched-chain amino acid catabolism and hexanoic acid production, potentially 
impacting energy balance. Apple dietary fibers, especially pectin, influenced 
the obese microbial community, altering both species and metabolites. Notably, 
the apple pectin feeding condition affected species like Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Bifidobacterium longum. By using genome-scale metabolic modeling, we 
discovered a mutualistic cross-feeding relationship between Megasphaera sp. 
MJR8396C and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. This in vitro study suggests that 
incorporating apple fibers into the diets of obese individuals can help modify 
the composition of gut bacteria and improve metabolic health. This personalized 
approach could help mitigate the effects of obesity. Video Abstract.

Elective and emergency Caesarean section (C-section) procedures are on the rise, 
exceeding the recommended guidelines by the World Health Organization. Higher 
morbidities and long-term health conditions are correlated to C-section 
deliveries, including neurodevelopmental disorders. During C-section delivery, 
newborns are not exposed to the vaginal commensal flora, which impedes the early 
establishment of the gut microbiota. The latter is essential for adequate 
neuro-immune processes to take place during infancy. In this study, we used a 
validated model of mice born by C-section (CSD), which mimics clinical 
observations of dysregulated gut microbiota. Animals were either born naturally 
or by CSD, before being adopted by dams who underwent delivery within the 12 
preceding hours. Behavioural analyses were conducted at post-natal day (PND) 21 
and 55. Our results indicate that animals born by C-section present 
significantly higher body weight in late (PND40-P53) but not early adolescence 
(PND21-P27), compared to animals born by vaginal delivery (VD). Male animals 
delivered by C-section presented significantly lower exploration time of the 
novel arm in the Y Maze test at PND55. However, at PND21, abnormal social 
interaction was witnessed in male and female animals born by CSD, with 
significantly decreased time spent interacting during the social interaction 
test. At both PND21 and PND55, animals from both sexes born by C-section 
presented significantly decreased time spent in the open arm of the Elevated 
Plus Maze test, compared to control animals. We then measured the expression of 
genes associated to neuroimmune interactions (microglia phenotype), inflammatory 
mediators and lipids in several brain structures of VD and CSD mice at PND21 and 
PND55. At weaning, animals born by CSD presented altered microglia, inflammatory 
and lipid metabolism signatures, with increased expression of Cd36, Csf1r and 
Tnfα in different brain regions of males, but not in females. At PND64, Csf1r, 
Tmem119 as well as C3ar1 were significantly increased in males born by 
C-section, but not in females. In males born by vaginal delivery, the expression 
of Cd36 at PND64 was correlated to anxiety at PND55, whilst a correlation 
between the expression of Clec7a and the number of head dippings in the elevated 
plus maze was also noted in males born by CSD. Altogether, our study shows 
altered emotional behaviour in animals delivered by CSD, which is likely 
explained by underlying neuro-inflammatory processes in different brain regions. 
Our work further supports the long-term consequences of CSD on brain health.

For a long time, traditional medicine has acknowledged the gut's impact on 
general health. Contemporary science substantiates this association through 
investigations of the gut microbiota, the extensive community of microorganisms 
inhabiting our gastrointestinal system. These microscopic residents considerably 
improve digestive processes, nutritional absorption, immunological function, and 
pathogen defense. Nevertheless, a variety of gastrointestinal and 
extra-intestinal disorders can result from dysbiosis, an imbalance of the 
microbial composition of the gut microbiota. A groundbreaking discovery is the 
gut-brain axis, a complex communication network that links the enteric and 
central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication allows the brain 
to influence gut activities and vice versa, impacting mental health and mood 
disorders like anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota can influence this 
communication by creating neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids, among 
other biochemical processes. These factors may affect our mental state, our 
ability to regulate our emotions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis. This study aimed to explore the complex interrelationships between the 
brain and the gut microbiota. We also conducted a thorough examination of the 
existing understanding in the area of how microbiota affects social behaviors, 
including emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions. We also explored 
the potential of interventions that focus on the connection between the gut and 
the brain, such as using probiotics to treat diseases of the CNS. This research 
opens up new possibilities for addressing mental health and neurological 
conditions in an innovative manner.

Natural bioactive ingredients face challenges in extensive application owing to 
low oral bioavailability. This can be improved by overcoming gastrointestinal 
barriers and facilitating targeted release through delivery strategies. This 
study provides a comprehensive review of targeted delivery systems using 
prebiotic carbohydrate matrices, focusing on structures, release mechanisms and 
applications. The bioactive ingredients can be encapsulated into nanohydrogels, 
nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, micro/nanocapsules and nanofibres to achieve 
controlled/targeted delivery to predetermined locations via interactions with 
pH, mucus, microbiome, enzymes and other factors in the colon. In particular, 
the prebiotic function of carbohydrates is generated by colonic microbiota 
degradation and fermentation, producing beneficial postbiotics through multiple 
metabolic pathways. This study provides certain insights into the in-depth 
development and application of prebiotic carbohydrate-based targeted delivery 
systems in the fields of food and health.

The human gut microbiome is a dynamic and intricate ecosystem, composed of 
trillions of microorganisms that play a pivotal role in maintaining overall 
health and well-being. However, the gut microbiome is constantly exposed to 
various environmental factors, including the bile produced by the liver, which 
can significantly impact its composition and function. Bile acids, secreted by 
the liver and stored in the gallbladder, modulate the gut microbiome, 
influencing its composition and function. This altered microbiome profile can, 
in turn, impact the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting an immunosuppressive 
environment that favors tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, changes in the 
gut microbiome can also influence the production of bile acids and other 
metabolites that directly affect cancer cells and their behavior. Moreover, bile 
acids have been shown to shape the microbiome and increase antibiotic 
resistance, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate relationships between bile, 
the gut microbiome, and the TME, highlighting the mechanisms by which this 
interplay drives cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Understanding 
these complex interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic 
strategies that target the gut-bile-TME axis and improve patient outcomes.

Microbiome modulation is one of the novel strategies in medicine with the 
greatest future to improve the health of individuals and reduce the risk of 
different conditions, including metabolic, immune, inflammatory, and 
degenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Regarding the latter, many studies 
have reported the role of the gut microbiome in carcinogenesis, formation and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its response to different 
systemic therapies. Likewise, obesity, one of the most important risk factors 
for CRC, is also well known for its association with gut dysbiosis. Moreover, 
obesity and CRC display, apart from microbial dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, 
which participates in their pathogenesis. Although human and murine studies 
demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in regulating energy 
metabolism and CRC development, little is understood about the contribution of 
the microbiome to the development of obesity-associated CRC. Therefore, this 
systematic review explores the evidence for microbiome changes associated with 
these conditions and hypothesizes that this may contribute to the pathogenesis 
of obesity-related CRC. Two databases were searched, and different studies on 
the relationship among obesity, intestinal microbiota and CRC in clinical and 
preclinical models were selected. Data extraction was carried out by two 
reviewers independently, and 101 studies were finally considered. Findings 
indicate the existence of a risk association between obesity and CRC derived 
from metabolic, immune, and microbial disorders.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards industrialization in 
food production, resulting in the implementation of higher hygiene standards 
globally. Our study focused on examining the impact of hygiene standards on 
tempeh, a popular Rhizopus-based fermented soybean product native to Indonesia, 
and now famous around the world. We observed that tempeh produced with 
standardized hygiene measures exhibited a microbiome with comparable bacterial 
abundances but a markedly different community structure and function than 
traditionally produced tempeh. In detail, we found a decreased bacterial 
abundance of lactobacilli and enterobacteria, bacterial diversity, different 
indicator taxa, and significantly changed community structure in industrial 
tempeh. A similar picture was found for functional analysis: the quantity of 
bacterial genes was similar but qualitative changes were found for genes 
associated with human health. The resistome of tempeh varied based on its 
microbiome composition. The higher number of antimicrobial resistance genes in 
tempeh produced without standardized hygiene measures mainly belong to multidrug 
efflux pumps known to occur in plant-based food. Our findings were confirmed by 
functional insights into genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from the 
dominant bacteria, e.g. Leuconostoc, Limosilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, 
Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Azotobacter and Enterobacter. They harboured an 
impressive spectrum of genes important for human health, e.g. for production of 
vitamin B1, B7, B12, and K, iron and zinc transport systems and short chain 
fatty acid production. In conclusion, industrially produced tempeh harbours a 
less diverse microbiome than the traditional one. Although this ensures 
production at large scales as well as biosafety, in the long-term it can lead to 
potential effects for human gut health.

Tremella fuciformis polysaccharides (TFPS) belong to natural bioactive 
macromolecule with both edible and medicinal value, possessing much 
bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antioxidant, antidiabetics, and 
immunomodulatory. Currently, the production of TFPS through submerged 
fermentation (TFPS-1) is gradually replacing the polysaccharides extracted from 
the fruiting body due to improved fermentation efficiency and reduced separation 
costs. However, it is still unclear about the effect of TFPS-1 on 
gastrointestinal digestion and gut microbial fermentation, which is directly 
related to the function of its biological activity. This study aimed to 
illustrate the effect of TFPS-1 on digestive process through in vitro digestion 
and fecal fermentation. TFPS-1 was indigestible during the simulated 
gastrointestinal tract. But TFPS-1 can be digested by intestinal flora leading 
to alterations in the total polysaccharides content, molecular weight, and 
apparent viscosity. Moreover, TFPS-1 regulated the composition of gut microbial, 
lowering the proportion of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and enhancing the 
abundances of Parabacteroides and Bacteroides. The change of intestinal flora 
produced more short chain fatty acids and lowered the pH. The KEGG metabolic 
pathway analysis indicated that TFPS-1 enriched lipid metabolism, glycan 
biosynthesis and metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. 
This study demonstrated that T. fuciformis fermented polysaccharide can be a 
potential prebiotic to optimize intestinal flora homeostasis and maintain host 
intestinal health.

The rapidly expanding food industry necessitates the use of food additives to 
achieve specific purposes. However, this raises new concerns in food safety due 
to the reported negative impacts of food additives on gut microbiota and host 
health, particularly in the context of continuous worldwide urbanization. This 
review summarizes the existing studies on the effects of different types of 
commonly used food additives on gut microbiota alteration, intestinal barrier 
disruption, metabolism disorder, and neurobehavior changes. These food 
additives, including emulsifiers, low-calorie sweeteners, inorganic 
nanoparticles, and preservatives, have been found to exert multifaceted impacts, 
primarily adverse effects, highlighting the potential risks associated with food 
additive exposure in various chronic diseases. Further research is warranted to 
elucidate the specific mechanisms, determine the relevance of these findings to 
humans, and clarify the suitability of certain food additives for vulnerable 
populations. It is crucial to note that natural food additives are not 
inherently superior to synthetic ones in terms of safety. Rigorous evaluation is 
still warranted before their widespread application in the food industry. 
Additionally, the potential synergistic effects of commonly used food additives 
combination in specific food categories on gut microbiota and host metabolism 
should be investigated to understand their relevance in real-world scenarios.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in regulating human 
physiology, with dysbiosis linked to various diseases, including heart failure 
(HF). HF is a complex syndrome with a significant global health impact, as its 
incidence doubles with each decade of life, and its prevalence peaks in 
individuals over 80 years. A bidirectional interaction exists between GM and HF, 
where alterations in gut health can worsen the disease's progression.
MAIN BODY: The "gut hypothesis of HF" suggests that HF-induced changes, such as 
reduced intestinal perfusion and altered gut motility, negatively impact GM 
composition, leading to increased intestinal permeability, the release of 
GM-derived metabolites into the bloodstream, and systemic inflammation. This 
process creates a vicious cycle that further deteriorates heart function. 
GM-derived metabolites, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), and secondary bile acids (BAs), can influence gene 
expression through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone 
modifications. These epigenetic changes may play a crucial role in mediating the 
effects of dysbiotic gut microbial metabolites, linking them to altered cardiac 
health and contributing to the progression of HF. This process is particularly 
relevant in older individuals, as the aging process itself has been associated 
with both dysbiosis and cumulative epigenetic alterations, intensifying the 
interplay between GM, epigenetic changes, and HF, and further increasing the 
risk of HF in the elderly.
CONCLUSION: Despite the growing body of evidence, the complex interplay between 
GM, epigenetic modifications, and HF remains poorly understood. The dynamic 
nature of epigenetics and GM, shaped by various factors such as age, diet, and 
lifestyle, presents significant challenges in elucidating the precise mechanisms 
underlying this complex relationship. Future research should prioritize 
innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. By identifying specific 
metabolite-induced epigenetic modifications and modulating the composition and 
function of GM, novel and personalized therapeutic strategies for the prevention 
and/or treatment of HF can be developed. Moreover, targeted research focusing 
specifically on older individuals is crucial for understanding the intricate 
connections between GM, epigenetics, and HF during aging.

The composition of human gut microbiota is dominated by bacteria which have been 
extensively studied. The role of intestinal eukaryote microorganisms like 
Blastocystis, however, remains under investigation. Moreover, the potential 
impact on gut health related to Blastocystis presence was primarily investigated 
in symptomatic individuals mainly from industrialized countries, and appears to 
be mostly beneficial to the host microbiota. Data from surveys conducted in 
underdeveloped countries with higher prevalence and from asymptomatic 
individuals could therefore be valuable. The aim of this preliminary study was 
to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota in relation to the protozoa 
Blastocystis ST1 and ST2 and Entamoeba hartmanni carriage in asymptomatic 
subjects living in a semi-urban area of Côte d'Ivoire to add data into the 
ongoing debate on the role of Blastocystis in host health. The amplification of 
the V3 and V4 regions of bacterial 16S rDNA genes was performed to obtain the 
gut microbiota composition, and differential analyses on alpha and beta 
diversity were performed from the phylum to genus taxonomic level. The analysis 
revealed that individuals positive for both protozoa exhibited higher alpha and 
beta diversity compared to those who tested negative. Additionally, their 
bacterial composition showed a reduction in Bacteroides and an increase in 
Prevotella 9. Relative abundances of some OTUs, particularly Faecalibacterium, 
observed in individuals who tested positive for protozoa, were correlated with a 
good state of health of the gut microbiota. Blastocystis ST1 and ST2 associated 
with E. hartmanni thus appeared to be related to a state of intestinal eubiosis.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients 
exhibited significant alterations. However, the causal relationship between gut 
microbiota and VTE has not been fully understood. This study aimed to assess the 
causal relationship between gut microbiota and the risk of VTE using a 
two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study.
METHODS: The gut microbiota and VTE genetic data were collected from the 
MiBioGen consortium and the UK biobank, respectively. The potential causal 
relationship between gut microbiota and VTE was investigated using a two-sample 
MR analysis, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, 
MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode methods. Cochran's Q-test, MR-PRESSO, 
and MR-Egger regression intercept analysis were utilized to perform sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: At the genus level, the results of MR analysis found that Coprococcus1 
(OR: 1.0029, 95% CI: 1.0005-1.0054, p = 0.0202) was suggestively linked with an 
increased risk of VTE, while Slackia (odds ratio (OR): 0.9977, 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.9957-0.9998, p = 0.0298), Butyricicoccus (OR: 0.9971, 95% CI: 
0.9945-0.9997, p = 0.0309), Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group (OR: 0.9972, 95% 
CI: 0.9946-0.9999, p = 0.0445), and Bacteroides (OR: 0.9964, 95% CI: 
0.9932-0.9995, p = 0.0234) were suggestively associated with a reduced risk of 
VTE. No heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy was detected.
CONCLUSION: This study found that there were potential causal relationships 
between five gut microbiota and VTE. Our findings may provide new insights into 
the mechanisms of VTE.

BACKGROUND: The rapid establishment and persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs 
is one of the main obstacles towards an HIV cure. While antiretroviral therapy 
supresses viral replication, it does not eradicate the latent reservoir of 
HIV-1-infected cells. Recent evidence suggests that the human microbiome, 
particularly the gut microbiome, may have the potential to modulate the HIV-1 
reservoir. However, literature is limited and the exact mechanisms underlying 
the role of the microbiome in HIV immunity and potential regulation of the viral 
reservoir remain poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we review updated knowledge on the associations between the human 
microbiome and HIV reservoir across different anatomical sites, including the 
gut, the lungs and blood. We provide an overview of the predominant taxa 
associated with prominent microbiome changes in the context of HIV infection. 
Based on the current evidence, we summarize the main study findings, with 
specific focus on consistent bacterial and related byproduct associations. 
Specifically, we address the contribution of immune activation and inflammatory 
signatures on HIV-1 persistence. Furthermore, we discuss possible scenarios by 
which bacterial-associated inflammatory mediators, related metabolites and host 
immune signatures may modulate the HIV reservoir size. Finally, we speculate on 
potential implications of microbiome-based therapeutics for future HIV-1 cure 
strategies, highlighting challenges and limitations inherent in this research 
field.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent advances, this review underscores the need for 
further research to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between 
the human microbiome and HIV reservoir. Further integrative multi-omics 
assessments and functional studies are crucial to test the outlined hypothesis 
and to identify potential therapeutic targets ultimately able to achieve an 
effective cure for HIV.

BACKGROUND: Chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) has been linked to the 
development of atherosclerosis, although the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota disruption 
in CAP-induced atherosclerosis development, focusing on trimethylamine N-oxide 
(TMAO)-related metabolites.
METHODS: The study utilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to transfer 
gut microbiota from mice with CAP to healthy mice. Atherosclerosis development 
was assessed by analyzing lesions in the aortic arch and aortic root. Serum 
lipid and inflammatory factor levels were measured. Composition and diversity of 
gut microbiota were analyzed using targeted metabolomics, with a focus on the 
ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. The expression of hepatic 
flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) and serum TMAO levels were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Mice receiving gut microbiota from CAP mice showed increased 
atherosclerotic lesions compared to controls, without significant differences in 
serum lipid or inflammatory factor levels. Alterations in gut microbiota 
composition were observed, characterized by an increase in the Firmicutes to 
Bacteroidetes ratio. Peptostreptococcaceae abundance positively correlated with 
atherosclerosis severity, while Odoribacteraceae showed a negative correlation. 
No significant differences were found in hepatic FMO3 expression or serum TMAO 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the role of gut microbiota disruption in 
CAP-mediated atherosclerosis development, independent of serum lipid or TMAO 
levels. Alterations in gut microbiota composition, particularly increased 
Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and specific bacterial families, were 
associated with atherosclerosis severity. These findings highlight the intricate 
interplay between gut microbiota and cardiovascular health in the context of 
CAP.

Negative experiences during adolescence, such as social isolation (SI), 
bullying, and abuse, increase the risk of psychiatric diseases in adulthood. 
However, the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases induced by these factors 
remain poorly understood. In adolescents, stress affects the intestinal 
homeostasis in the gut-brain axis. This study determined whether adolescent SI 
induces behavioral abnormalities by disrupting colonic function. Adolescent mice 
exposed to SI exhibit spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in 
the hippocampus (HIP). SI decreased the differentiation of mucin-producing 
goblet cells, which was accompanied by alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiota, particularly the depletion of mucin-feeding bacteria. Treatment with 
rebamipide, which promotes goblet cell differentiation in the colon, attenuated 
SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in the HIP and 
decreased cystine, a downstream metabolite of homocysteine. Treatment with 
cystine ameliorated SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and increased 
microglial C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) levels in the HIP. Inhibition of 
CCL7 receptors by antagonists of CC motif chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 3 
(CCR3) in the HIP prevented spatial cognitive deficits induced by SI. Infusion 
of CCL7 into the HIP following microglial ablation with clodronate liposome 
induced spatial cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that adolescent SI 
decreases serum cystine levels by damaging the colonic goblet cells, resulting 
in spatial cognitive deficits by triggering microglial activation in the HIP. 
Our results indicate that increased CCL7 expression in hippocampal microglia may 
contribute to spatial cognitive deficits by activating CCR2 and CCR3.

Prenatal stress (PNS) has widespread effects on offspring, including aberrant 
immune development and behavioural deficits. The microbiome is a mediator of the 
dissemination of stress effects to the offspring through immunomodulation and 
metabolite production. Metabolites derived from the mother and their gut 
microbiota pass to the foetus and can affect immune and nervous development. 
Stress affects the abundance of such metabolites, including the tryptophan (Trp) 
pathway, which are involved in immune and nervous system function. We 
hypothesized that the PNS is associated with dysregulation of Trp metabolism. We 
further posited that treatment with a Trp-metaboliser Parasutterella 
excrementihominis would abrogate PNS-associated deleterious effects on offspring 
development. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice were exposed to restraint 
stress and administered P. excrementihominis (Dam n = 3-9; Offspring n = 5-10). 
PNS increased maternal gut Trp and both maternal and offspring inflammation. P. 
excrementihominis treatment reduced the PNS-induced excess pool of maternal gut 
Trp. Some PNS effects on foetal neuroinflammation were reduced in severity due 
to handling effects from bacterial gavage. However, P. excrementihominis was 
anti-inflammatory in dam and offspring and anxiolytic in offspring of Pe-treated 
dams. These data illustrate that elevated Trp levels are associated PNS and its 
downstream deleterious offspring inflammatory and behavioural outcomes while P. 
excrementihominis, a Trp-metabolizer, can ameliorate these effects and improve 
offspring outcomes.

Since animal growth promoters (AGPs) are used in large quantities and commonly 
released to the environment from animal farms, it is necessary to determine 
whether such agents should be regarded as an environmental toxin that poses a 
threat to the ecosystem and health risk to wildlife. In this study, a 
multi-omics approach was employed to explore the effects of a representative 
AGP, lincomycin, on key metabolic and physiological functions of animals, using 
a mouse model. The results indicated that exposure to lincomycin resulted in a 
significant increase in growth rate of mice (50.11 %) over an 8 weeks period, 
during which significant decrease (61.94 %) and increase (68.64 %) in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Escherichia coli, respectively, was 
observed in the gut microbiota, indicating that the gut microbiota structure has 
been altered. Moreover, the mice exhibited altered lipid profiles and liver 
damage suggestive of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Disruptions in blood glucose and insulin levels associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also observed. Furthermore, lincomycin was found to cause 
suppression in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of 
related genes and elevated inflammatory mediators, potentially resulting in 
increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Our findings underscore the 
detrimental effects of lincomycin on animal health and highlight the necessity 
for comprehensive toxicological assessments of lincomycin and other AGPs before 
their environmental release.

A strong association exists between the high-fat diet (HFD) and the incidence of 
obesity, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease, affecting an increasing 
number of individuals. More and more research has shown that probiotics and gut 
microbiota play important roles in dietary absorption, metabolism, and general 
health of the host. This aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic 
effects and the underlying mechanisms of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TCCC11824 
(CGMCC 8198) on hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice and humans. First, there was 
a dose-dependent improvement in HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice 
that had been treated with L. plantarum TCCC11824 for 5 wk, thus restoring the 
balance of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, it showed that cell lysate of L. 
plantarum TCCC11824 could directly exhibit protective effects on the hepatocyte 
steatosis induced by oleic acid, and regulate the expression of HMGCR by 
inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, L.plantarum TCCC11824 ameliorated the 
expression of indicators of hyperlipidemia and inhibited the synthesis of SCFAs 
(short-chain fatty acids), as shown by blood and fecal tests in hyperlipidemic 
patients. In summary, L. plantarum TCCC11824 exerts anti-hyperlipidemic and 
anti-obesity effects through the regulation of HMGCR via NF-κB and modulating 
gut microbiota, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the 
treatment of hyperlipidemia and obesity.

Introduction. Obesity is a global health concern, affecting individuals of all 
ages and genders. One promising strategy to combat obesity is by addressing gut 
microbiota dysbiosis, with probiotics being a reliable intervention. However, 
single-strain probiotics may not effectively modulate the complex microbial 
communities in the gut, suggesting the need for multi-strain approaches.Gap 
Statement. Probiotics are known to benefit gut health; however, the efficacy of 
single-strain probiotics in modulating gut microbiota is limited. Multi-strain 
probiotic community (MSPC) may offer a more effective approach for addressing 
obesity-related gut dysbiosis, but its specific effects on individuals and 
microbial diversity require further investigation.Aim. This study aimed to 
evaluate the potential of a dairy-origin MSPC in modulating obesity-related gut 
microbiota from lean and obese Pakistani volunteers using a simulated CoMiniGut 
model.Methodology. Gut microbiota from lean and obese volunteers were treated 
with MSPC in a simulated CoMiniGut system. Bacterial counts, microbial diversity 
(α- and β-diversity) and microbial community composition were analysed pre- and 
post-treatment. The impact of MSPC on specific bacterial genera and microbial 
metabolites was assessed, with statistical significance determined 
(P≤0.05).Results. The effect of MSPC was individualized, reducing bacterial 
counts in lean 1 and lean 2 samples, while significantly increasing bacterial 
counts in obese 2 and obese 3 samples (P≤0.05). MSPC significantly improved 
α-diversity in lean 2, lean 3, obese 2 and obese 3 samples (P≤0.05). 
Proteobacteria decreased in the lean group and increased in the obese group 
post-MSPC treatment. In the lean group, pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella, 
Escherichia and Enterobacter were significantly reduced (P≤0.05), whereas 
beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased 
significantly in the obese group (P≤0.05). Among the selected metabolites, only 
butanoic acid was detected in all tested samples, with MSPC affecting metabolite 
concentrations and types.Conclusion. MSPC demonstrated a potential for 
modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis in both lean and obese individuals, with 
effects on bacterial counts, microbial diversity and metabolite concentrations. 
MSPC could serve as a promising option for personalized the modulation of gut 
microbiota in obesity management.

PURPOSE: Nobiletin (NOB), an extract derived from citrus fruit peels, is 
renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the 
specific impact of NOB on alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and its regulatory 
pathways remains an underexplored area of study. This research aims not only to 
confirm the positive regulatory effects of NOB on ALD but also to explore its 
mechanism of action through the "gut-liver axis" theory.
METHODS: Utilizing the Lieber-DeCarli method, C57BL/6J male mice were subjected 
to a four-week liquid alcohol diet to induce ALD. The mechanism of NOB 
alleviating ALD is explored by detecting biochemical analysis, western blot, 
qRT-PCR, and gut microbiota analysis.
RESULTS: In vivo, it was observed that NOB treatment (2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) 
significantly alleviated alcohol-induced liver inflammation, accompanied by 
normalization of aberrant gene and protein expression patterns associated with 
inflammation. Notably, this treatment also enhanced intestinal barrier 
integrity, resulting in decreased intestinal LPS permeability and a subsequent 
reduction in ileum inflammation. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA analysis demonstrated 
that NOB effectively ameliorated alcohol-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by 
restoring the balance between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and promoting the 
growth of beneficial bacterial families like Akkermansiaceae. In vitro, 
utilizing LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, NOB's efficacy in mitigating liver 
inflammation was further corroborated. Specifically, the treatment was found to 
exert its anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of the NF-κB/TLR4 
signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: our study has made significant progress in understanding NOB's 
hepatoprotective effects on alcohol-induced ALD mice. This perspective not only 
clarifies NOB's therapeutic role in ALD management but also inspires future 
research on additional gut-liver axis indicators for a comprehensive exploration 
of NOB's therapeutic potential.

Early weaning is frequently accompanied by a significant increase in diarrhea 
and mortality rates, which reduces rabbits' performance. Although antibiotics 
can reduce pathogenic bacteria, they also harm beneficial microorganisms and 
disrupt the normal intestinal microbiota balance. In order to find non-residue 
and non-toxic alternatives to antibiotics to ensure the safety of animal 
products, we conducted a study on the effect of compound microecological 
preparations supplementation on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. A 
total of 60 female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: CON, 
supplemented with probiotics at 3, 6, and 9 g/female rabbit/day from day 24 of 
gestation until weaning. We observed that probiotics supplementation 
significantly enhanced production performance (P < 0.05), immune and antioxidant 
function (P < 0.05), as well as intestinal flora composition in lactating 
rabbits and their offspring. Notably, compared with the control group, the 
experimental group exhibited a 19.23%, 44.22%, and 24.57% increase in milk yield 
(P = 0.002). Regarding rabbit growth performance, the average body weight of 
young rabbits in the experimental group showed a significant increase of 3.59%, 
10.22%, and 6.74% at day 35 (P = 0.022), whereas the average daily gain (ADG) of 
rabbits aged between 21 and 35 days was significantly elevated by 4.94%, 17.06%, 
and 6.28% in the experimental group (P < 0.001). In conclusion, probiotics 
supplementation can significantly enhance lactation performance, promote growth 
and disease resistance in rabbits, as well as improve intestinal health when 
administered at a dosage of 6 g/day. Moreover, the limited sample size in this 
study may hinder the detection of subtle effects, and augmenting the sample size 
will bolster the reliability of the study findings.
IMPORTANCE: The intestinal environment of rabbits is fragile and susceptible to 
environmental influences, leading to inflammatory intestinal diseases. Adding 
antibiotics to rabbit feed can achieve the effect of preventing and treating 
inflammation, which can also lead to the imbalance of the gut microbiota and 
residual antibiotics in agricultural products. Composite probiotics are live 
microbial feed additives composed of various ratios of probiotics and have 
become the most promising alternative to antibiotics due to their residue-free 
and non-toxic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 
compound probiotics on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. Our 
findings highlight the potential of compound microecological preparations as an 
effective strategy for enhancing lactation performance, immune function, and 
antioxidant capacity in rabbits. The supplementation of probiotics through 
rabbit milk offers a promising approach to optimize the growth and health 
outcomes of newborn rabbits.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a global health problem with limited 
therapeutic options. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to this disorder are 
not yet fully understood, and in this respect, metabolomics represents a 
promising approach to decipher metabolic events related to AUD. The plasma 
metabolome contains a plethora of bioactive molecules that reflects the 
functional changes in host metabolism but also the impact of the gut microbiome 
and nutritional habits.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the impact of severe AUD (sAUD), and of 
a 3-week period of alcohol abstinence, on the blood metabolome (non-targeted 
LC-MS metabolomics analysis) in 96 sAUD patients hospitalized for alcohol 
withdrawal.
RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of different lipids 
((lyso)phosphatidylcholines, long-chain fatty acids), short-chain fatty acids 
(i.e. 3-hydroxyvaleric acid) and bile acids were altered in sAUD patients. In 
addition, several microbial metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid, 
p-cresol sulfate, hippuric acid, pyrocatechol sulfate, and metabolites belonging 
to xanthine class (paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline) were sensitive to 
alcohol exposure and alcohol withdrawal. 3-Hydroxyvaleric acid, caffeine 
metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) and microbial 
metabolites (hippuric acid and pyrocatechol sulfate) were correlated with 
anxiety, depression and alcohol craving. Metabolomics analysis in postmortem 
samples of frontal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid of those consuming a high 
level of alcohol revealed that those metabolites can be found also in brain 
tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data allow the identification of neuroactive metabolites, from 
interactions between food components and microbiota, which may represent new 
targets arising in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases such as sAUD.
FUNDING: Gut2Behave project was initiated from ERA-NET NEURON network (Joint

Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have emerged as major global public 
health challenges, causing numerous infections and fatalities each year. 
However, current measures, including vaccines and treatments, are often limited 
or ineffective. This highlights the urgent need for novel preventive strategies 
to control the spread of key mosquito-borne viruses like DENV and ZIKV. In a 
recent study published in Science, Zhang et al. isolated a bacterium named 
Rosenbergiella_YN46 from the gut of field-caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in 
Yunnan Province, China. This commentary reviews their findings, published on 
April 19, 2024, which describe the symbiotic bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 and 
its ability to block flavivirus transmission, including both DENV and ZIKV. The 
bacterium shows promising potential for future dengue fever prevention and 
provides valuable insights into a novel biological approach for controlling 
mosquito-borne viral diseases.

Arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) are non-digestible dietary fibers that 
potentially confer a health benefit by stimulating beneficial bacteria in the 
gut. Still, a detailed overview of the diversity of gut bacteria and their 
specificity to utilize structurally different AXOS has not been provided to date 
and was aimed for in this study. Moreover, we assessed the genetic information 
of summarized bacteria, and we extracted genes expected to encode for enzymes 
that are involved in AXOS hydrolysis (based on the CAZy database). The taxa 
involved in AXOS fermentation in the gut display a large variety of AXOS-active 
enzymes in their genome and consequently utilize AXOS to a highly different 
extent. Clostridia and Bacteroidales are generalists that consume many 
structurally diverse AXOS, whereas Bifidobacterium are specialists that 
specifically consume AXOS with a low degree of polymerization. Further 
complexity is evident from the fact that the exact bacterial species, and in 
some cases even the bacterial strains (e.g. in Bifidobacterium longum) that are 
stimulated, highly depend on the specific AXOS molecular structure. Furthermore, 
certain species in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillaceae are active as 
cross-feeders and consume monosaccharides and unbranched short 
xylo-oligosaccharides released from AXOS. Our review highlights the possibility 
that (enzymatic) fine-tuning of specific AXOS structures leads to improved 
precision in targeting growth of specific beneficial bacterial species and 
strains in the gut.

Contemporary scientific discussions are increasingly focusing on Akkermansia 
muciniphila due to its complex influence on intestinal physiology. This article 
provides a comprehensive analysis of the various effects Akkermansia muciniphila 
has on intestinal inflammation, while also exploring its potential associations 
with obesity and cardiovascular diseases. A systematic literature search was 
conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate with the following 
keywords: Akkermansia muciniphila, obesity, cardiovascular risk, and 
inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of our mini-review was to examine the 
impact of Akkermansia bacteria on the intestines, cardiovascular system, and its 
relationship with obesity. Through a detailed review of current literature, the 
article seeks to elucidate the complex interactions of Akkermansia muciniphila 
within the human body, highlighting its potential contributions to health 
improvement and medical interventions. Research indicates that Akkermansia 
muciniphila positively correlates with maintaining intestinal health, modulating 
the cardiovascular system, and aiding in weight management. However, the number 
of studies available is small, and the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila on 
human health require further research.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains a challenging condition both for patients 
and clinicians, characterized by its chronic nature and the elusive complexity 
of its underlying mechanisms. The multifaceted relationship between the 
neuroendocrine axis, gut microbiota, and inflammatory response has emerged as a 
focal point in recent research, offering new insights into the pathophysiology 
of IBS. The neuroendocrine axis plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate 
balance between the brain and the gut, often referred to as the "gut-brain 
axis". This bidirectional communication is essential for regulating 
gastrointestinal function, stress responses, and overall homeostasis. 
Dysregulation of this axis, as highlighted by elevated cortisol and serotonin 
levels in IBS patients, suggests that neuroendocrine imbalances may 
significantly contribute to the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. These 
findings underscore the need for a broader understanding of how stress and 
emotional factors influence IBS, potentially guiding more effective, 
personalized treatment approaches. Equally important is the role of the gut 
microbiota, a diverse and dynamic ecosystem that directly impacts gut health. 
This dysbiosis disrupts gut function and appears to exacerbate the 
neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. These findings align with the growing 
recognition that gut microbiota is a critical player in IBS, influencing both 
the disease's onset and progression.

Obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic and health conditions are significant 
concerns in societies worldwide, necessitating the development of effective 
treatment and prevention strategies. Gut microbiota, particularly Akkermansia 
muciniphila (A. muciniphila), have emerged as key players in the onset of 
obesity and diabetes due to their impact on metabolic pathways related to food 
absorption, low-grade inflammation, and insulin signaling. Using A. muciniphila 
have been identified as a promising approach in obesity and diabetes management. 
However, the complex culture conditions and animal-based culture medium 
limitations, restrict its therapeutic perspectives as a probiotic. Pasteurized 
A. muciniphila has been found to be safe and potentially more cost-effective 
compared to live strains. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) obese-diabetic models have 
been used in previous studies due to their functional conservation in lipid 
metabolism and glucose homeostasis. These models offer a novel, easy-to-maintain 
platform for researchers studying obesity and diabetes. So, investigations are 
suggested to evaluate the effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila on gut 
microbiota composition, inflammation, and metabolic complications in an 
obese-diabetic zebrafish model. The findings can be translated into several 
potential implications and can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms 
underlying the effects of A. muciniphila on obesity and diabetes in the host's 
body.

The consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has surged globally, raising 
significant public health concerns due to their associations with a range of 
adverse health outcomes. This review aims to elucidate potential health impacts 
of UPF intake and underscore the importance of considering diet quality when 
interpreting study findings. UPF group, as classified by the Nova system based 
on the extent of industrial processing, contains numerous individual food items 
with a wide spectrum of nutrient profiles, as well as differential quality as 
reflected by their potential health effects. The quality of a given food may 
well misalign with the processing levels so that a UPF food can be nutritious 
and healthful whereas a non-UPF food can be of low quality and excess intake of 
which may lead to adverse health consequences. The current review argues that it 
is critical to focus on the nutritional content and quality of foods and their 
role within the overall dietary pattern rather than only the level of 
processing. Further research should dissect health effects of diet quality and 
food processing, investigate the health impacts of ingredients that render the 
UPF categorization, understand roles of metabolomics and the gut microbiome in 
mediating and modulating the health effects of food processing, and consider 
environmental sustainability in UPF studies. Emphasizing nutrient-dense 
healthful foods and dietary patterns shall remain the pivotal strategy for 
promoting overall health and preventing chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol drinking and gut microbiota are related to hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), but the specific relationship between them remains unclear.
AIMS: We aimed to establish the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis and 
develop machine learning (ML) models in predicting the occurrence of early-stage 
HCC.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients with early-stage HCC and 278 controls 
were recruited. Alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis was established 
through the mediation/moderation effect analyses. Eight ML algorithms including 
Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 160 pairs of individuals were included for analyses. The 
mediation effects of Genus_Catenibacterium (P = 0.024), Genus_Tyzzerella_4 
(P < 0.001), and Species_Tyzzerella_4 (P = 0.020) were discovered. The 
moderation effects of Family_Enterococcaceae (OR = 0.741, 95%CI:0.160-0.760, 
P = 0.017), Family_Leuconostocaceae (OR = 0.793, 95%CI:0.486-3.593, P = 0.010), 
Genus_Enterococcus (OR = 0.744, 95%CI:0.161-0.753, P = 0.017), 
Genus_Erysipelatoclostridium (OR = 0.693, 95%CI:0.062-0.672, P = 0.032), 
Genus_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.655, 95%CI:0.098-0.749, P = 0.011), 
Species_Enterococcus_faecium (OR = 0.692, 95%CI:0.061-0.673, P = 0.013), and 
Species_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.653, 95%CI:0.086-0.765, P = 0.014) were uncovered. 
The predictive power of eight ML models was satisfactory (AUCs:0.855-0.932). The 
XGBoost model had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.932).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models based on the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis 
are valuable in predicting the occurrence of early-stage HCC.

Intestinal dysbiosis and the associated l-tryptophan metabolic disorder are 
pivotal in inflammatory bowel disease progression, leading to a compromised 
intestinal barrier integrity. Remedying the dysfunction in tryptophan metabolism 
has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Herein, we reprogram the 
tryptophan metabolism in situ by EcN-TRP@A/G, encapsulating the engineered 
probiotic, EcN-TRP, with enhanced tryptophan synthesis capacity, for sustained 
modulation, thereby restoring intestinal barrier function and microbial 
homeostasis. The pH-responsive dual-layered EcN-TRP@A/G microcapsule developed 
via high-voltage electrospraying and liquid interface self-assembly, preserved 
probiotic viability in the harsh gastrointestinal milieu, and facilitated 
targeted colon release. Bioluminescent tracking in mice reveals a 22.84-fold 
increase in EcN-TRP@A/G viability and distribution compared to naked EcN-TRP. 
Targeted metabolomics highlights EcN-TRP@A/G's modulation of the 
tryptophan-indole pathway. Oral administration of EcN-TRP@A/G sustained elevates 
indole metabolites, particularly indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic 
acid, in colon tissue for up to 7 days. In IBD mice, EcN-TRP@A/G improves 
intestinal permeability, reduces inflammation, and recovers the gut microbiome 
by enhancing beneficial bacteria abundance like Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and 
Anaerostipes while suppressing pathogenic strains like Escherichia-Shigella. Our 
findings offer a cost-effective approach, harnessing the probiotic metabolic 
potential in situ through engineered modifications for effective IBD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability among older 
people aged 60 years and above, with majority eventually being diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological agents approved for dementia include 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) inhibitors like rivastigmine, donepezil and 
galantamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine, 
prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with each other, depending on the 
severity of disease. There is currently no available study demonstrating the 
clinical response to these drugs for AD in the Filipino population. Hence, this 
protocol aims to characterise the clinical, genetic, microbial and metabolic 
factors associated with drug responses to donepezil, rivastigmine and/or 
memantine for AD in a cohort of Filipinos with late-onset AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol involves a multisite descriptive study that 
will use two study designs: (1) a descriptive, cross-sectional study to 
characterise the clinical profile of Filipino dementia patients with AD and (2) 
an exploratory prospective cohort study to investigate drug response-related 
genetic, gut microbiome and metabolome signatures of a subset of the recruited 
AD patients. At least 153 patients with mild or moderate AD aged 65 years old 
and above will be recruited regardless of their treatment status. A subset of 
these patients (n=60) who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included 
further in the exploratory cohort study. These patients will be grouped

IMPORTANCE: The composition of the gut microbiota is essential for a dog's 
health and its adaptation to the environment. Different bacteria can produce the 
same essential metabolites beneficial to health owing to bacterial functional 
redundancy in microbial communities.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the gut bacterial communities of dogs from 
different breeds, all kept under identical domestication conditions.
METHODS: Noninvasive sampling and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing were used 
to compare the composition and function of the gut microbiota of three dog 
breeds: the Chinese Kunming dog (CKD), German Shepherd dog (GSD), and Belgian 
Malinois dog (BMD).
RESULTS: The gut microbiota of the three dog breeds consisted of 257 species 
across 146 genera, 60 families, 35 orders, 15 classes, and 10 phyla. The 
dominant bacterial phyla across the three breeds were Firmicutes (57.44%), 
Fusobacteriota (28.86%), and Bacteroidota (7.63%), while the dominant bacterial 
genera across the three breeds were Peptostreptococcus (21.08%), Fusobacterium 
(18.50%), Lactobacillus (12.37%), and Cetobacter (10.29%). Further analysis 
revealed significant differences in the intestinal flora of the three breeds at 
the phylum and genus levels. The intestinal flora of BMD was significantly 
richer than that of CKD and GSD. The functional prediction and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the primary functions of 
the gut microbiota in these breeds were similar, with significant enrichment in 
various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, 
secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and microbial metabolism in different 
environments. The intestinal flora of these breeds also played a crucial role in 
genetic information processing, including transcription, translation, 
replication, and material transport.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results provide novel insights into the 
intestinal flora of intervention dogs and suggest novel methods to improve their 
health status, which help increase microbial diversity and normalize metabolite 
production in diseased dogs.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding the microbial diversity within the gastrointestinal 
tract of wild Korean water deer (KWD; Hydropotes inermis argyropus) is essential 
for gaining insights into their health and ecological interactions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to isolate and identify aerobic and anaerobic 
bacterial species in the feces of wild KWD.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 55 wild KWD of varying age and sex. 
Aerobic bacteria were cultured at 37°C for 24-48 h under standard conditions, 
whereas anaerobic bacteria were cultured at 37°C for 48-72 h in an anaerobic 
environment. Bacterial identification was conducted using DNA extraction and 
polymerase chain reaction amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: The predominant aerobic bacteria identified belonged to the Firmicutes 
(58.18%) and Proteobacteria (41.82%) phyla, with Escherichia coli (31.82%) and 
Bacillus cereus (31.82%) being the most common species. Among anaerobic 
bacteria, most belonged to the Firmicutes (71.03%), Proteobacteria (27.10%), and 
Fusobacteriota (1.87%) phyla, with Paraclostridium bifermentans (28.97%) and E. 
coli (22.43%) being the most prevalent species. Other frequently identified 
anaerobic species were Fusobacterium varium, Lactococcus garvieae, 
Terrisporobacter glycolicus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium sporogenes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings indicate a diverse microbial community 
in the feces of water deer, offering valuable insights into their gut microbiota 
and its potential implications for health and ecology.

Adlay seed bran, typically discarded or used as animal feed, represents a 
significant resource waste. This study investigates the structural and 
physicochemical properties, in vitro digestive behavior, and fecal fermentation 
profiles of adlay seed bran polysaccharides (ASBPs) prepared using different 
methods. These methods include hot water extraction, Aspergillus niger 
solid-state fermentation (SSF), and enzyme-assisted SSF with β-glucosidase, 
cellulase, and xylanase, referred to as ASBP, ASBP-F, ASBP-GF, ASBP-CF, and 
ASBP-XF, respectively. Results showed that enzyme-assisted SSF with A. niger 
improved extraction efficiency and uniformity of ASBPs, increasing total neutral 
sugars, uronic acids, mannose, and galactose while reducing glucose content, 
molecular weight, and particle size. ASBP-CF had the best extraction rate, sugar 
content, lowest molecular weight, finest uniformity, and smallest particle size. 
In simulated digestion tests, all ASBP variants were stable in stomach and small 
intestine conditions but degradable by human fecal microbiota, showing varying 
fermentability levels. ASBPs increased Bacteroidetes populations, inhibited 
Proteobacteria growth, and enhanced short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production, 
with ASBP-CF showing the highest fermentability and prebiotic efficacy. ASBP-CF 
was particularly effective in promoting beneficial bacteria like Bacteroides and 
restraining harmful bacteria such as Escherichia_Shigella, producing more SCFAs 
during fermentation. These findings suggest that ASBP-CF has potential as a 
dietary supplement to improve gut health, presenting a high-value utilization 
strategy for adlay seed bran.

Oral intake of probiotics is a promising approach to alleviate colitis. However, 
environmental sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract and poor adhesion of 
probiotics to the intestine hamper the remedial effects. In this study, a simple 
yet effective novel probiotic multilayer coating consisting of 
Fe3+-protocatechuic acid (PCA) crosslinked network and Ca2+-induced sodium 
alginate (SA) for arming Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP) was developed. In 
the dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse model, SA-PCA-LP effectively 
alleviated colitis by regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and 
repairing gut barriers. In addition, SA-PCA-LP regulated the gut microbiota and 
promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids, which further promoted the 
remission of colitis. Untargeted metabolomics also revealed that the scymnol, 
adenosine 5'-monophosphat, guanidylic acid, and 9H-purine-9-ol were 
significantly up-regulated in SA-PCA-LP group. In general, the novel coating 
strategies developed in the present study will motivate researchers to arm 
probiotics with various prebiotics to effectively alleviate colitis.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, 
confer a health benefit to the host. The selection criteria for probiotics 
include strain safety, viability, tolerance, metabolite production and/or the 
ability to modulate the immune system. Probiotics are commonly used in 
industries, such as food, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, 
and aquaculture. Recently, the medicinal applications of probiotics have gained 
attention and are being explored for the prevention and treatment of various 
diseases. One emerging area of interest is their potential role in psychological 
disorders. Mental illnesses, characterised by disturbances in behaviour, mood, 
thinking, and emotions, affect over one billion people globally. While various 
preventive and treatment options for mental disorders exists, each is associated 
with certain limitations. A new avenue being explored is the gut-brain axis, a 
complex bi-directional communication between the gut and the brain, that is 
facilitated by hormonal, neuronal, humoral, and immunological pathways. This 
system plays an important role in mental health. Probiotics, as a key modulator 
of the gut microbiome, could play a vital role in this communication. However, 
the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Probiotics may act through the 
production of metabolites and neuroactive substances, as well as through 
immunomodulation and cytokine production. Current data shows promising effects 
on stress, mood, and depression, presenting probiotics as a potential natural 
treatment option for psychological disorders. Nevertheless, major limitations in 
the existing research include insufficient clinical outcomes, limited sample 
sizes, and variable dosing. Future advancements may be achieved through 
stratifications based on gut microbiota, the use of next-generation probiotic 
strains, and the conduct of comprehensive validation studies.

The composition of feed significantly influences the growth performance and gut 
microbiota of broiler chicks, impacting their overall health and productivity. 
This study aimed to investigate the effects of cassava pellets and enzymes 
supplementation on the growth performance, meat quality, serum biochemical 
indices, and cecal microbial community of broiler chicks. A total of 144 healthy 
1-day-old AA broilers were randomly assigned to six dietary groups: basal diet 
(K1), basal diet + 5 % cassava pellets (K2), basal diet + 10 % cassava pellets 
(K3), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets (K4), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets 
+ 0.3 % tannase (K5), and basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets + 0.3 % tannase + 
2500 U/kg α-amylase (K6). At 21 days, growth performance, meat quality, serum 
biochemical indices, and cecal microbial composition were analyzed. Compared to 
K1, the end weight was significantly higher in the K3 and K5 groups (P < 0.05); 
average daily weight gain was significantly higher in the K3 and K6 groups (P < 
0.05); and the feed-to-weight ratio was lower in the K3 group (P < 0.05). Cecal 
microbiota analysis revealed that the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and 
Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla. Alpha diversity showed a significant 
increase in the Chao index in the K3 group and in the Shannon and Simpson 
indices in the K6 group compared to the K1 group (P < 0.05). Beta diversity 
indicated similar microbial compositions across groups. LEfSe analysis showed 
increased numbers of specific bacteria in treated groups. Serum analysis 
revealed significantly higher ALT levels in the K4 group and higher IBIL levels 
in the K5 group (P < 0.05), with Bacteroides plebeius and Megamonas positively 
correlated with ALT (P < 0.05). The addition of 10 % cassava pellets to the diet 
improved the growth performance and meat quality of broilers from 1 to 21 days 
of age and enhanced the microbial composition, providing valuable insights for 
optimizing broiler diets and improving economic returns.

Bisphenol AF (BPAF), a substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), exhibits potent 
endocrine-disrupting properties that pose a serious health hazard to organisms. 
This study employed marine medaka as a model, subjecting them to different 
concentrations of BPAF (0.61, 6.65, and 91.88 μg/L) from the embryonic stage for 
a period of 160 days. Findings showed that 91.88 μg/L BPAF reduced survival 
rates and altered sex ratios. Furthermore, exposure to BPAF at all 
concentrations led to a significant increase in body length and weight. 
Behavioral analysis revealed that BPAF exposure impaired the swimming ability of 
the medaka. Histological changes included disrupted ovarian development, reduced 
sperm count, liver inflammation, and intestinal damage. Gene expression analysis 
revealed impacts on nervous system (e.g., gap43, itr, elavl3), HPG axis (e.g., 
gthα, erα, 3βhsd), and liver genes (e.g., chgl, vtg2). Additionally, BPAF 
altered the diversity and richness of gut microbes in marine medaka, leading to 
significant changes in specific bacterial species and intestinal functions. In 
conclusion, long-term BPAF exposure induced neurotoxicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and impaired digestive and immune systems in marine medaka, with 
sex-specific effects. These results provide further evidence of the potential 
hazards of BPAF as an environmental pollutant.

Viral hepatitis is a public health problem, about 1 million people die due to 
complications of this viral disease, the etiological agents responsible for 
inducing cirrhosis and cellular hepatocarcinoma are HBV and HCV, both 
hepatotropic viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in most cases. The 
regulation of the microbiota performs many physiological functions, which can 
induce normal intestinal function and produce essential nutrients for the human 
body. Metabolites derived from gut microbiota or direct regulation of host 
immunity and metabolism have been reported to profoundly affect tumorigenesis in 
liver disease. If the microbiota is unbalanced, both exogenous and symbiotic 
microorganisms can affect a pathological process. It is well understood that the 
microbiota plays a role in viral diseases and infections, specifically the 
hepatic portal pathway has been linked to the gut-liver axis. In HBV and HCV 
infections, the altered bacterial representatives undergo a state of dysbiosis, 
with subsequent establishment of the pathobiome with overexpression of taxons 
such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus. 
This dysregulated microbiome induces a microenvironment conducive to the 
development of hepatic complications in patients with acute and chronic HBV and 
HCV infection, with subsequent dysregulation of cytokines IFN-α/β, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
TGF-β, IL-6 and IL-10, which alter the dysfunction and damage of the hepatic 
portal system. In view of the above, this review aimed to correlate the 
pathophysiological mechanisms in HBV and HCV infection, the dysregulation of the 
microbiome in patients infected with HBV and HCV, the most altered cytokines in 
the microbiome, and the most altered bacterial representatives in the pathobiome 
of infection.

Sheep that are infected with gastrointestinal helminths experience a significant 
impact on their health and productivity. Among the helminths, nematodes like 
Haemonchus contortus, Oesophagostomum spp., Bunostomum trigonocephalum, 
Nematodirus battus, Trichostrongylus spp. and Teladorsagia circumcincta are 
particularly pathogenic. Understanding the interactions among parasites, hosts, 
and their microbiomes is crucial in developing new approaches in the management 
of parasites. This study examines the bacterial profile of Trichuris ovis, a 
highly prevalent nematode among Kashmir Merino sheep, and the influence of 
nematode infection on the caecal microbiome of its host. Sheep were selected 
based on T. ovis infection status, and samples were collected from infected and 
non-infected caecum. The 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis revealed distinct 
microbial communities in T. ovis, infected caecum, and non-infected caecum. 
Proteobacteria dominated the T. ovis microbiome, while infected caecum was rich 
in Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota, and non-infected caecum had a higher 
proportion of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobiota. At the genus level, T. ovis was 
predominantly associated with Escherichia/Shigella, while infected caecum had 
higher proportions of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Treponema. Non-infected 
caecum was characterized by WCHB1-41, Prevotella, and Succiniclasticum like 
genera. Alpha and beta diversity indicated significant differences in microbiome 
among the groups, with higher diversity observed in infected caecum. The study 
found T. ovis infection significantly alters the caecal microbiome of sheep, 
introducing potentially pathogenic bacteria and reducing beneficial ones. These 
findings underscore the complex relationship between host, parasite, and 
microbiome, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies to manage 
helminth infections and their broader ecological impacts.

Hyalomma anatolicum and Rhipicephalus microplus are tick species that are 
important vectors of numerous pathogens affecting both humans and livestock. 
Endosymbionts, such as Coxiella-like endosymbionts (CLE), Francisella-like 
endosymbionts (FLE), and Candidatus Midichloria, play a crucial role in the 
physiology and vector competence of these ticks. In this study, we investigated 
the microbial composition of H. anatolicum and R. microplus from four 
geographically distinct regions of Pakistan to assess whether environmental 
differences influence their microbiomes. We analyzed the ticks' gut microbiome 
targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA for Illumina 16S metagenome 
NGS sequencing and processed overall 144 ticks. Analysis of gut bacterial 
composition resulted in observation of 1200 R. microplus and 968 H. anatolicum 
unique amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Relative abundance, Alpha diversity 
(Shannon, Faith's phylogenetic distance) and beta diversity metrics 
(Bray-Curtis, Jaccard and UniFrac) were analyzed and revealed that H. anatolicum 
ticks have significantly unique and diverse microbial communities with 
Acinetobacter indicus and Francisella-like endosymbionts dominating as opposed 
to Candidatus Midichloria. Rhipicephalus microplus exhibited results consistent 
with the previous studies with no major changes in microbiome including 
Coxiella-like endosymbionts as the major contributor. These findings suggest 
that geographical and environmental factors play a significant role in shaping 
the tick microbiome, with potential consequences for disease transmission and 
tick survivability. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional roles 
of these microbial shifts and their impact on public health and livestock in 
affected regions.

Publisher: TITLE: Étude comparative des microbiomes des tiques Rhipicephalus 
microplus et Hyalomma anatolicum.
ABSTRACT: Hyalomma anatolicum et Rhipicephalus microplus sont des espèces de 
tiques qui sont d’importants vecteurs de nombreux agents pathogènes affectant à 
la fois les humains et le bétail. Les endosymbiontes, tels ceux de type Coxiella 
(CLE), de type Francisella (FLE) et Candidatus Midichloria, jouent un rôle 
crucial dans la physiologie et la compétence vectorielle de ces tiques. Dans 
cette étude, nous avons étudié la composition microbienne de H. anatolicum et R. 
microplus de quatre régions géographiquement distinctes du Pakistan pour évaluer 
si les différences environnementales influencent leurs microbiomes. Nous avons 
analysé le microbiome intestinal des tiques en ciblant la région hypervariable 
v3-v4 de l’ARNr 16S pour le séquençage 16S NGS Illumina du métagénome et avons 
traité au total 144 tiques. L’analyse de la composition bactérienne intestinale 
a permis d’observer 1200 (R. microplus) et 968 (H. anatolicum) variants de 
séquençage d’amplicons (ASV) uniques. L’abondance relative, la diversité alpha 
(distance phylogénétique de Shannon, Faith) et les mesures de diversité bêta 
(Bray–Curtis, Jaccard et UniFrac) ont été analysées, ce qui a révélé que les 
tiques H. anatolicum ont des communautés microbiennes particulièrement uniques 
et diversifiées, avec des endosymbiontes de type Acinetobacter indicus et 
Francisella dominants, par opposition à Candidatus Midichloria. Rhipicephalus 
microplus a présenté des résultats cohérents avec les études précédentes, sans 
changement majeur du microbiome, y compris les endosymbiontes de type Coxiella 
comme contributeurs majeurs. Ces résultats suggèrent que les facteurs 
géographiques et environnementaux jouent un rôle important dans la formation du 
microbiome des tiques, avec des conséquences potentielles sur la transmission 
des maladies et la survie des tiques. Des recherches supplémentaires sont 
nécessaires pour élucider les rôles fonctionnels de ces changements microbiens 
et leur impact sur la santé publique et le bétail dans les régions touchées.

The probiotic effects of Bacillus are strain-specific and dependent on both 
spore and vegetative forms, but the distinct contributions of these forms to 
probiotic functionality are not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate 
and compare the impacts of vegetative forms and spores of Bacillus subtilis and 
Bacillus licheniformis on probiotic functions in vitro and in vivo. We 
systematically assessed the anaerobic metabolic capabilities and the potential 
to enhance the intestinal barrier function of four Bacillus strains, leading to 
the selection of Bacillus subtilis X22 and Bacillus licheniformis N-3 for 
detailed investigation. Utilizing in vitro fermentation with murine fecal 
microbiota, we observed that the spores form of Bacillus licheniformis N-3 
noticeably positively regulated the gut microbiota under anaerobic conditions. 
Concurrently, both spore and vegetative forms of Bacillus licheniformis N-3 and 
Bacillus subtilis X22 demonstrated the ability to prevent pathogen adhesion, 
reduce inflammation, combat oxidative stress, and promote cellular autophagy to 
reduce apoptosis in response to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) 
infection in the IPEC-J2 cell model. As a facultative anaerobe, Bacillus 
licheniformis N-3 exhibited a tendency toward superior regulatory capacity in 
enhancing the anti-infective activity of IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. In the 
pathogens challenge mouse model, B. licheniformis N-3 effectively preserved the 
integrity of jejunal tissue and enhanced the expression of glycoproteins in 
goblet cells. Moreover, B. licheniformis N-3 strengthened the epithelial barrier 
by increasing the levels of Occludin and Claudin-1 in the jejunum, thus 
promoting overall intestinal health. This research offers new insights into 
strain selection and the life cycle utilization of Bacillus probiotics.

Chicken gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining their 
physiological health. However, the cultivability of chicken gut microbiota is 
not well understood, limiting the exploration of certain key gut bacteria in 
regulating intestinal health and nutritional metabolism. This study aimed to 
examine the cultivability of chicken cecal microbiota and to provide guidance 
for future chicken gut microbiota cultivation. A total of 58 different culture 
conditions were applied to culture broiler cecal microbiota, and the 
culture-dependent (CD; pooled colonies form each plate) and culture-independent 
(CI; broiler cecal contents) samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
and microbial analysis. The CD methods detected higher microbial richness (3,636 
vs 2,331 OTUs) than CI methods, and the recovery rates of bacterial OTUs and 
genera reached 43.6% and 68.9%, respectively. The genera of Bacteroides (19.9%), 
Alistipes (11.0%) and Barnesiella (10.7%) were highly abundant detected by CI 
methods, however, there occupied a small proportion (<1.0%) of total cultured 
microbiota in CD methods. We then developed reference figures and tables showing 
optimal cultivation conditions for different gut bacteria taxa. Moreover, 81 
different lactic acid bacteria strains covering 5 genera were isolated, and 15 
strains had less than 97.0% similarity to known bacteria in the national center 
for biotechnology information (NCBI) online database. Overall, this study 
provides preliminary guidance in culturing specific gut microbiota from 
chickens, which will contribute to future studies to characterize the biological 
functions of key microbes in chicken nutritional metabolism and health.

PURPOSE: In order to address the global public health concern of colitis, this 
study was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of Lactobacillus 
plantarum LR002 (LR) on the remission of ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice and to 
explore the possible underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: The effect of LR on UC was analyzed by using dextran sodium sulfate 
(DSS)-induced UC model in mice (n = 9). To assess the therapeutic effect of LR 
on UC in mice, the disease activity index (DAI) of mice, histopathological 
alterations, intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, and intestinal microflora 
were determined.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated a reduction in the DSS-induced DAI in UC mice. 
Additionally, it mitigated colon shortening, minimized intestinal tissue damage, 
and preserved intestinal tight junction proteins (Claudin-3, Occludin, and 
ZO-1). LR reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and 
TNF-α) and oxidative mediators (MPO, SOD and MDA) in the colon of UC mice, which 
could also alleviate the imbalance of intestinal flora in UC mice, increase the 
abundance of Prevotellaceae, and Ligilactobacillus, and decrease the abundance 
of Bacteroidaceae and Eubacteriumrum. LR can also increase the levels of PPARγ 
in the nucleus and inhibit the MAPK/NF-ĸB signaling pathway in UC mice. Besides, 
the reduction of the content of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) in the colon of 
UC mice was relieved.
CONCLUSION: The above results forge a scientific basis for LR as natural 
anti-inflammatory food to improve the imbalance of inflammatory intestinal flora 
and promote intestinal health.

Probiotics have been suggested to contribute to cancer prevention through 
various mechanisms. Additionally, recent studies have established a connection 
between diet, microbiota, and overall health. In this respect, the current study 
aims to understand the impact of crocin on possible anti-cancer and 
antibacterial effects of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) in colorectal cancer 
cells and pathogenic bacteria. The study involved collecting cell-free 
supernatants (CFSs) from untreated bacteria as a control group and bacteria 
treated with crocin, and then examining their ability to prevent the growth of 
HCT-116 colon cancer cells. It was demonstrated that L. lactis, when treated 
with crocin, can effectively combat against various types of pathogenic bacteria 
and can survive in acidic conditions. Both CFS and cro-CFS exhibited a 
dose-dependent inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth but crocin-treated bacteria 
showed more significant effects. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) for cell growth inhibition was 97.41 µL/mL in CSF group and 72.07 µL/mL 
in cro-CFS group. The results of flow cytometry tests confirmed the MTT assay 
findings, showing that cro-CFS group had a significantly higher rate of 
apoptosis compared to CFS of control group. The results obtained from qPCR also 
showed that the Caspase 9 and BAX genes were upregulated, and the BCL-2 
expression level was reduced in cells treated with cro-CFS compared to the CFS 
group. Overall, these findings suggest that crocin may alter the composition of 
CFS from probiotics that are present in the gut, potentially impacting their 
ability to combat cancer.

BACKGROUND: Most infants with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) do not have 
an underlying anatomical risk factor. Thus, other non-anatomical risk factors 
should be considered. Since the most common pathogens arise from the fecal 
microbiota, our aim was to investigate whether the gut microbiota composition 
differs between febrile infants younger than 2 months with or without UTI.
METHODS: In this prospective, case-control, pilot study, we performed 16S 
ribosomal ribonucleic acid amplicon sequencing to characterize gut microbiota of 
febrile neonates with and without UTI admitted to the pediatric ward at Shamir 
Medical Center between February 2019 and May 2021.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 42 febrile neonates: 17 with and 25 without 
febrile UTI. We found a significant difference in beta diversity (i.e. 
between-sample/study group similarity indices) between the UTI and non-UTI group 
(p = 0.016). There were also distinct differences in the relative abundance of 
the 20 most prevalent genera. Furthermore, several genera were significantly 
enriched in the UTI group, with others dominating the non-UTI group. 
Streptococci were underrepresented in the UTI group. There was no difference in 
alpha diversity (i.e. within-sample diversity/richness) between groups.
CONCLUSION: Febrile neonates with UTI have a different fecal microbiota 
composition (beta-diversity), but not alpha diversity, in comparison to febrile 
neonates without UTI. A larger study is warranted to confirm these findings and 
their potential applications.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Short sleep duration (SSD) affects people's health in 
multiple ways. This study attempted to explore the effect of SSD on the gut 
microbiota.
METHODS: In the American Gut Project Database, 361 individuals (without troubled 
by disease recently) with less than 6 h of sleep per day were obtained and 
matched with normal sleep time individuals according to gender, age, and BMI. 
Furthermore, the raw data of 16s rRNA in feces were downloaded and analyzed 
using QIIME2, and STAMP was used for data statistics. PICRUST2 was used for 
predicting the alteration of microbial function.
RESULTS: The SSD did not affect the microbial α-diversity. SSD increased the 
abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and the families Rikenellaceae, 
Verrucomicrobiaceae, and S24-7, and decrased the Coriobacteriaceae. Moreover, 
PICRUST2 predicted that SSD affected 15 metabolic pathways. Subgroup analyses 
showed that SSD had more significant effects on the microbiota in normal-weight 
females.
CONCLUSION: SSD substantially modifies the abundance of specific gut microbiota 
taxa, exerting a pronounced influence particularly on females, highlighting the 
need for further investigation into the bidirectional relationship between sleep 
patterns and gut microbiota.

Background. The growing interest in microbiota-epigenetics-immune system 
research stems from the understanding that microbiota, a group of 
micro-organisms colonized in the human body, can influence the gene expression 
through epigenetic mechanisms and interaction with the immune system. 
Epigenetics refers to changes in gene activity that are not caused by the 
alteration in the DNA sequence itself.Discussion. The clinical significance of 
this research lies in the potential to develop new therapies for diseases linked 
to the imbalance of these microbial species (dysbiosis), such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. The intricate interaction between microbiota and 
epigenetics involves the production of metabolites and signalling molecules that 
can impact our health by influencing immune responses, metabolism and 
inflammation. Understanding these interactions could lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies targeting microbiota-epigenetic pathways to improve health 
outcomes.Conclusion. In this context, we aim to review and emphasize the current 
knowledge and key concepts that link the microbiota to epigenetics and immune 
system function, exploring their relevance to the development and maintenance of 
homeostasis and susceptibility to different diseases later in life. We aim to 
elucidate key concepts concerning the interactions and potential effects among 
the human gut microbiota, epigenetics, the immune system and ageing diseases 
linked to dysbiosis.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity and its related ailments is on the rise, 
posing a substantial challenge to public health. Tea, widely enjoyed for its 
flavors, has shown notable potential in mitigating obesity. Yet, there remains a 
lack of exhaustive bibliometric studies in this domain.
METHODS: We retrieved and analyzed multidimensional data concerning tea and 
obesity studies from January 2004 to June 2024, using the Web of Science Core 
Collection database. This bibliometric investigation utilized tools such as 
Bibliometrix, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer to gather and analyze data concerning 
geographical distribution, leading institutions, prolific authors, impactful 
journals, citation patterns, and prevalent keywords.
RESULTS: There has been a significant surge in publications relevant to this 
field within the last two decades. Notably, China, Hunan Agricultural 
University, and the journal Food and Function have emerged as leading 
contributors in terms of country, institution, and publication medium, 
respectively. Zhonghua Liu of Hunan Agricultural University has the distinction 
of most publications, whereas Joshua D. Lambert of The State University of New 
Jersey is the most cited author. Analyses of co-citations and frequently used 
keywords have identified critical focus areas within tea anti-obesity research. 
Current studies are primarily aimed at understanding the roles of tea components 
in regulating gut microbiota, boosting fat oxidation, and increasing metabolic 
rate. The research trajectory has progressed from preliminary mechanism studies 
and clinical trials to more sophisticated investigations into the mechanisms, 
particularly focusing on tea's regulatory effects on gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: This study offers an intricate overview of the prevailing 
conditions, principal focus areas, and developmental trends in the research of 
tea's role against obesity. It delivers a comprehensive summary and discourse on 
the recent progress in this field, emphasizing the study's core findings and 
pivotal insights. Highlighting tea's efficacy in obesity prevention and 
treatment, this study also points out the critical need for continued research 
in this area.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a persistent and complex condition 
accomplished by inflammation of the gastrointestinal system, encompassing 
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This condition is caused by 
the combination of genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and 
dysregulated immunological responses, which complicates diagnosis and treatment. 
The latest developments in gastroenterology have revealed the critical 
significance of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) are a type of microbial component that potentially regulate 
intestinal inflammation. The impact of microbiota-derived bacterial EVs (bEVs) 
on intestinal inflammation is mediated through several methods. They can 
intensify inflammation or stimulate defensive responses by delivering 
immunomodulatory cargo. Improved comprehension could enhance inventive 
diagnostic and treatment strategies for IBD. This study aimed to explore the 
relationship between microbiota-derived bEVs and the complex nature of IBD. We 
performed a thorough analysis of the formation, composition, mechanisms of 
action, diagnostic possibilities, therapeutic implications, and future prospects 
of these microbiota-derived bEVs.

Diabetic bone disease, a form of secondary osteoporosis, is characterized by 
weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures, especially in patients with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D). This review explores the key mechanisms driving this 
condition, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), and proinflammatory cytokines, all of which disturb normal bone 
turnover by disrupting the functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We examine 
the roles of bone turnover and mineralization, as well as how microvascular 
complications affect bone microarchitecture. Additionally, the influence of gut 
hormones, such as GLP-1 and GIP, and gut microbiota, particularly species like 
Akkermansia muciniphila, on the gut-bone axis is discussed, as these factors 
play a role in regulating bone density and structure. While T2D patients may 
show normal or even elevated bone mineral density (BMD), the underlying quality 
of bone is often compromised, leading to increased fragility. This review 
integrates current knowledge on the molecular, hormonal, and microbial 
interactions contributing to diabetic bone disease. By highlighting these 
pathways, we aim to offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies and 
inform future research aimed at improving the diagnosis, treatment, and overall 
management of this condition.

INTRODUCTION: The XuLing JianGu recipe (XLJGR) is an empirical traditional 
Chinese medicine formula used for the treatment of osteoporosis. This study aims 
to explore the effects of XLJGR on the intestinal microbiota composition and 
endogenous metabolites in ovariectomized (OVX) rats.
METHODS: An OVX rat model was established to evaluate the intervention effects 
of XLJGR. The measured indicators included bone density, serum bone metabolism 
markers, and an analysis of the types and abundances of intestinal microbiota, 
along with changes in endogenous metabolites. Additionally, MC3T3-E1 cells were 
used to validate the differential metabolites.
RESULTS: XLJGR significantly reduced the abundance of Bacteroides, 
Butyricicoccus, and other bacterial strains in the gut. KEGG metabolic pathway 
enrichment analysis showed that XLJGR intervention led to notable changes in 
pathways such as peptidoglycan biosynthesis, carbapenem biosynthesis, and 
vancomycin resistance. Moreover, XLJGR significantly upregulated key intestinal 
microbiota metabolites, including gabapentin(GAB), camphoric acid(CAA), and 
nonanedioic acid(AZA), thereby promoting the proliferation and osteogenic 
differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the potential biomedical applications of XLJGR 
in promoting bone health by positively affecting intestinal microbiota and 
metabolic characteristics. These findings suggest that XLJGR may serve as a 
viable alternative in the treatment of osteoporosis, warranting further 
exploration of its therapeutic mechanisms and clinical applications.

Mapping Pesticide-Induced Metabolic Alterations in Human Gut Bacteria.

Chen L, Yan H, Di S, Guo C, Zhang H, Zhang S, Gold A, Wang Y, Hu M, Wu D, 
Johnson CH, Wang X, Zhu J.

Pesticides can modulate gut microbiota (GM) composition, but their specific 
effects on GM remain largely elusive. Our study demonstrated that pesticides 
inhibit or promote growth in various GM species, even at low concentrations, and 
can accumulate in GM to prolong their presence in the host. Meanwhile, the 
pesticide induced changes in GM composition are associated with significant 
alterations in gut bacterial metabolism that reflected by the changes of 
hundreds of metabolites. We generated a pesticide-GM-metabolites (PMM) network 
that not only reveals pesticide-sensitive gut bacteria species but also report 
specific metabolic changes in 306 pesticide-GM pairs (PGPs). Using an in vivo 
mice model, we further demonstrated a PGP's interactions and verified the 
inflammation-inducing effects of pesticides on the host through dysregulated 
lipid metabolism of microbes. Taken together, our findings generate a PMM 
interactions atlas, and shed light on the molecular level of how pesticides 
impact host health by modulating GM metabolism.

The human microbial flora is quite diverse and versatile, playing several 
beneficial roles in association with the host and deriving nutrition from it. 
The present study aimed to identify gut microbial flora with potential probiotic 
activities. Eighteen bacterial isolates were screened from ten male individuals 
in this study. Seven bacterial isolates, NCCP-2046, NCCP-2031, NCCP-2035, 
NCCP-2040, NCCP-2041, NCCP-2044, and NCCP-2046, were isolated from the gut 
samples of volunteer men belonging to various areas of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. 
These bacterial isolates were cultured on De Man Rogosa and Sharpe Media (MRS), 
Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA), and Nutrient agar, which showed efficient bacterial 
growth. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of these bacterial 
strains were studied under their optimal growth conditions, along with molecular 
investigations. The antibiotic sensitivity pattern was tested using Kirby-Bauer 
method, which verified the higher MIC against all eight antibiotics used except 
for oxacillin. Phylogenetic analysis of only four bacterial isolates was 
performed based on their 16S rRNA sequences, and their top-hit sequence 
similarities in NCBI and EzBioCloud.net (95-98% and 94%) verified that these 
bacterial candidates belong to the Priestia and Staphylococcus genera. Based on 
molecular evidence through phylogeny and sequence similarities with previously 
defined bacterial candidates, the bacterial strains MG-461621 (NCCP-2031), 
MG-461622 (NCCP-2035), and MG-561934 (NCCP-2046) are presumed to be members of 
Priestia or novel species/genera, while MG-461623 (NCCP-2039) is also found to 
be a previously identified species of Staphylococcus. However, due to decreased 
similarity with the top-hit sequences, it could also be presumed to represent a 
member of a novel genus.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and microbiome have emerged in recent years as 
transformative fields with far-reaching implications for various biomedical 
domains. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis examining the 
intersection of AI and the microbiome (AIM). The study aims to provide 
information on this interdisciplinary field's research landscape, trends, and 
emerging topics. Using a systematic approach, data-driven studies were extracted 
from the Scopus database on 23 November 2023 and analyzed using the VOSviewer 
and Bibliometrix applications. The regression coefficient of 0.94 and the yearly 
growth rate of 7.46% in AIM production indicate a consistent increase over time. 
Identification of essential contributors, organizations, and nations illuminated 
cooperative networks and research hotspots. The trend themes are the gut 
microbiome, disease prediction, machine learning, transfer learning, 
categorization, big data, artificial neural networks, chronic rhinosinusitis, 
epidemiology, COPD, and bronchoalveolar lavage. These hot issues in AIM reflect 
the present emphasis on research and developments in our knowledge of the 
microbiome's function in health, sickness, and individualized treatment. The 
findings give researchers, policymakers, and industry experts a thorough picture 
of the research environment and guide future paths in AIM's fascinating and 
promising subject.

BACKGROUND: Acquiring sufficient knowledge and understanding the importance of 
intestinal microbiota and probiotics in health and disease, as well as their 
potential for interactions with concurrently administered drugs, can 
significantly influence future pharmacotherapeutic practices among health 
science students.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, factors influencing 
knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding intestinal microbiota and 
probiotics and their interactions with drugs among students of the Faculty of 
Medicine in Novi Sad.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the form of 
an anonymous questionnaire among first- and final-year medical and pharmacy 
students. Predictors of knowledge scores were analyzed using a negative binomial 
regression model.
RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 263 medical and pharmacy students 
(44.58% first-year and 55.5% final-year students). Approximately half of the 
students (53.2%) demonstrated fair knowledge, 34.2% had poor knowledge, and only 
12.5% had good knowledge about the intestinal microbiota and probiotics. Study 
year and self-assessment of knowledge were statistically significant predictors 
of knowledge scores, while the presence of chronic diseases, previous education, 
and lifestyle were not. The most common indications for probiotic use among 
respondents were antibiotic use (75.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (69.9%). A 
large number of respondents reported not paying attention to the concurrent use 
of probiotics with drugs or food, nor to the choice of specific probiotic 
strains. Most students expressed that they receive insufficient information on 
this topic at the university.
CONCLUSION: Most students demonstrate inadequate knowledge about the gut 
microbiota and probiotics, which affects their practical use of these 
supplements. The primary reasons for this are insufficient information and 
unreliable sources of information. Therefore, enhancing education on this topic 
could significantly improve the knowledge and pharmacotherapeutic practices of 
future healthcare professionals.

The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. 
Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice 
hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin 
commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal 
commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize 
the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania 
pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in 
enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune 
surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal 
environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in 
mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined 
that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial 
IL-33 and downstream IL-33-ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. 
Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to 
helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a 
context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse 
commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal 
commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse 
facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental 
outcomes and phenotypes.

The human gut microbiome is highly personal. However, the contribution of gut 
physiology and environment to variations in the gut microbiome remains 
understudied. Here we performed an observational trial using multi-omics to 
profile microbiome composition and metabolism in 61 healthy adults for 9 
consecutive days. We assessed day-to-day changes in gut environmental factors 
and measured whole-gut and segmental intestinal transit time and pH using a 
wireless motility capsule in a subset of 50 individuals. We observed substantial 
daily fluctuations, with intra-individual variations in gut microbiome and 
metabolism associated with changes in stool moisture and faecal pH, and 
inter-individual variations accounted for by whole-gut and segmental transit 
times and pH. Metabolites derived from microbial carbohydrate fermentation 
correlated negatively with the gut passage time and pH, while proteolytic 
metabolites and breath methane showed a positive correlation. Finally, we 
identified associations between segmental transit time/pH and coffee-, diet-, 
host- and microbial-derived metabolites. Our work suggests that gut physiology 
and environment are key to understanding the individuality of the human gut 
microbial composition and metabolism.

Due to their broad-spectrum activities, ivermectin and moxidectin are widely 
used anthelminthics in veterinary and human medicine. However, ivermectin has 
recently been shown to perturbate bacterial growth. Given the macrolide-like 
structure of both ivermectin and moxidectin, there is a need to characterize the 
antibiotic spectrum of these anthelminthics and their potential implications in 
the development of cross-resistance to macrolides and other families of 
antibiotics. Here, we characterize growth dynamics of 59 bacterial isolates in 
presence of ivermectin and moxidectin. Further, we assessed the effect of 
repeated anthelminthic exposure in 5 bacterial isolates on sensitivity to 
different antibiotics, both via growth dynamics and minimal inhibitory 
concentration. We found, that anthelminthic growth phenotypes are comparable to 
a selection of tested antibiotics. Bacterial anthelminthic challenging resulted 
in decreased anthelminthic sensitivity, and to some extent, decreased antibiotic 
sensitivity. Hence, potential off-target effects of large-scale administration 
of ivermectin and moxidectin should be carefully monitored.

Melatonin (MT) (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an indoleamine recognized 
primarily for its crucial role in regulating sleep through circadian rhythm 
modulation in humans and animals. Beyond its association with the pineal gland, 
it is synthesized in various tissues, functioning as a hormone, tissue factor, 
autocoid, paracoid, and antioxidant, impacting multiple organ systems, including 
the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms of extra-pineal MT production and 
its role in microbiota-host interactions remain less understood. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of MT, including its production, actions 
sites, metabolic pathways, and implications for human health. The 
gastrointestinal tract is highlighted as an additional source of MT, with an 
examination of its effects on the intestinal microbiota. This review explores 
whether the microbiota contributes to MT in the intestine, its relationship to 
food intake, and the implications for human health. Due to its impacts on the 
intestinal microbiota, MT may be a valuable therapeutic agent for various 
dysbiosis-associated conditions. Moreover, due to its influence on intestinal MT 
levels, the microbiota may be a possible therapeutic target for treating health 
disorders related to circadian rhythm dysregulation.

The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we 
perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, 
and healthy controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene 
functions, and antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External 
metagenomic datasets from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were 
analyzed to validate our multi-biome findings. We found that Enterococcus 
faecium and Bifidobacterium spp. were enriched in both diseases. Enriched 
Escherichia coli was characteristic of CD and was linked to numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes involved in efflux pumps and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli 
virulence factors. Virome changes correlated with shifts in the bacteriome, 
including increased abundances of phages encoding pathogenic genes. 
Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in UC and CD, 
respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli had negative 
associations with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in CD. 
Multi-biome signatures and their interactions in UC and CD showed high 
similarities between Japan and other countries. Since bacteria, phages, and 
fungi formed multiple hubs of intra- or trans-kingdom networks with SCFA 
producers and pathobionts in UC and CD, an approach targeting the interaction 
network may hold therapeutic promise.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a 
significant global health issue, affecting over 30% of the population worldwide 
due to the rising prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This spectrum of liver disease ranges from isolated 
steatosis to more severe forms such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 
Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in MASLD pathogenesis, 
showing that dysbiosis significantly impacts metabolic health and the 
progression of liver disease. This review critically evaluates current 
microbiome-centered therapies in MASLD management, including prebiotics, 
probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and emerging 
therapies such as engineered bacteria and bacteriophage therapy. We explore the 
scientific rationale, clinical evidence, and potential mechanisms by which these 
interventions influence MASLD. The gut-liver axis is crucial in MASLD, with 
notable changes in microbiome composition linked to disease progression. For 
instance, specific microbial profiles and reduced alpha diversity are associated 
with MASLD severity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome could 
modulate disease progression by improving gut permeability, reducing 
endotoxin-producing bacteria, and altering bile acid metabolism. Although 
promising, these therapies require further research to fully understand their 
mechanisms and optimize their efficacy. This review integrates findings from 
clinical trials and experimental studies, providing a comprehensive overview of 
microbiome-centered therapies' potential in managing MASLD. Future research 
should focus on personalized strategies, utilizing microbiome features, blood 
metabolites, and customized dietary interventions to enhance the effectiveness 
of these therapies.

Periodontal diseases, particularly periodontitis, are complex inflammatory 
conditions caused by interactions between oral microbiota and the host immune 
response. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria like Tannerella 
forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis are key in 
pathogenesis. This review examines how LPS impacts systemic health through 
direct invasion, compromised oral barriers, increased vascular permeability, and 
immune cell transport. LPS triggers inflammation in periodontal tissues, leading 
to tissue destruction and disease progression. In the bloodstream, LPS 
contributes to conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
respiratory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. Current treatments include 
mechanical debridement, antibiotics, antimicrobial mouthwashes, and 
anti-inflammatory therapies. Despite progress, gaps remain in understanding the 
molecular mechanisms of LPS in systemic diseases. Future research should focus 
on longitudinal studies, the gut-oral axis, biomarkers for early detection, and 
the lymphatic system's role in LPS dissemination. Maintaining periodontal health 
is crucial for overall systemic well-being.

There is increasing interest in utilizing senolytics to selectively remove 
senescent cells from intestinal tissues, with the aim of maintaining a healthy 
gut environment during aging. This strategy underscores the potential of 
senolytics to enhance gut health by delaying intestinal aging and positively 
modulating gut microbiota. Certain plant-based phytochemicals have demonstrated 
promising senolytic effects. Beyond their ability to eliminate senescent cells, 
these compounds also exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, 
reducing oxidative stress and inflammation-key drivers of age-related diseases. 
By selectively removing senescent cells from the intestine, senolytic 
phytochemicals contribute to an improved intestinal inflammatory environment and 
promote the growth of a diverse microbial community. Ultimately, the dietary 
intake of these senolytic phytochemicals aids in maintaining a healthier 
intestinal microenvironment by targeting and clearing aged enterocytes.

Honeybees play a vital role in pollination and the maintenance of ecosystem 
biodiversity, making their health and well-being crucial for agriculture and 
environmental sustainability. Bee health is modulated by symbiotic 
microorganisms colonizing the gut in balanced proportions. Studies have 
demonstrated that these beneficial bacteria have the capacity to enhance the 
immune system of honey bees, having substantial impact on regulating their 
immunological responses and hence aiding in defending against pathogenic 
illnesses. Another important aspect of honeybee health is their innate immune 
system that is related to their ability to synthesize antimicrobial peptides 
(AMP). AMPs, the small, cationic peptides are the humoral effector molecules 
that are synthesized in the hemolymph of the insects after being exposed to 
microbial infectious agents. A number of honeybee's gut microbiota especially 
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), are known to regulate the production of several AMPs 
and hence are able to provide protection to these insects against a number of 
disease agents by modulating their innate immune response via induction of the 
AMPs genes. These AMPs mainly produced by adult workers are an important and 
integral part of an insect's immune response. Several AMPs namely apidaecins, 
abaecins, hymenoptaecins and defensins produced in the adult honeybee, hold the 
ability to control or prevent a number of diseases in these pollinator insects.

Edible fungal polysaccharides have emerged as significant bioactive compounds 
with diverse therapeutic potentials, including notable anti-tumor effects. 
Derived from various fungal sources, these polysaccharides exhibit complex 
biological activities such as antioxidant, immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, 
and anti-obesity properties. In cancer therapy, members of this family show 
promise in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis through mechanisms like 
apoptosis induction and modulation of the immune system. This review provides a 
detailed examination of contemporary techniques for the targeted isolation and 
structural elucidation of edible fungal polysaccharides. Additionally, the 
review highlights the application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) 
methodologies to facilitate efficient and accurate structural analysis of these 
polysaccharides. It also explores their interactions with immune cells within 
the tumor microenvironment and their role in modulating gut microbiota, which 
can enhance overall immune function and potentially reduce cancer risks. 
Clinical studies further demonstrate their efficacy in various cancer 
treatments. Overall, edible fungal polysaccharides represent a promising 
frontier in cancer therapy, leveraging their natural origins and minimal 
toxicity to offer novel strategies for comprehensive cancer management.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis and decreasing 
production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which aggravate the injury of 
kidney. It has been found that a variety of Chinese medicine polysaccharides can 
regulate gut microbiota, especially probiotics, and have beneficial effects on 
human health. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is a major component of Astragalus 
aceus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether APS can regulate gut 
microbiota-SCFAs to slow the progression of CKD. Adenine-induced CKD mice (Ade) 
were established and APS was treated. The renal protection of APS on CKD mice 
was evaluated by renal function and pathological staining of renal tissues. 
Feces samples were collected for 16SrRNA sequence and LC-MS/MS analysis. Kidney 
G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) levels were also detected in renal tissue. APS 
supplementation can reduce serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels in mice 
model (Ade) and attenuate renal tubular interstitial injury and renal fibrosis. 
Further application of 16SrRNA sequencing showed that the abundance of SCFA 
producing bacteria, such as Kineothrix, Faecalibaculum, Akkermansia, 
Lactobacillus, and Roseburia, was upregulated after APS treatment. Fecal 
LC-MS/MS detection showed that the levels of acetate, propionate and butyrate in 
Ade mice increased after APS supplementation. The detection of renal GPRs showed 
that APS supplementing could significantly increase the levels of renal GPR41 
and GPR43, and also partially increase the levels of GPR109a in Ade mice. Our 
research confirms that APS supplementation can upregulate the abundance of SCFA 
producing bacteria and increase SCFA levels to attenuate renal tubular 
interstitial injury and fibrosis via GPRs.

INTRODUCTION: Both liraglutide and colesevelam improve bile acid diarrhea 
symptoms. Colesevelam binds excess amounts of diarrhea-causing bile acids in the 
colon, whereas the mode of action for liraglutide remains elusive. In this 
article, we examined the impact of colesevelam and liraglutide treatment on the 
concentrations of bile acids in serum and feces and the fecal microbiota 
composition to better understand the 2 drugs' modes of action.
METHODS: Bile acid species were analyzed in serum and fecal samples from a 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks 
of orally administered colesevelam (1,875 mg twice daily, n = 26) or 
subcutaneously administered liraglutide (uptitrated by weekly increments of 0.6 
mg from 0.6 to 1.8 mg daily, n = 26) in patients with 75 
selenium-homotaurocholic acid test-verified, idiopathic, or postcholecystectomy 
bile acid diarrhea. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing at the same time points.
RESULTS: Colesevelam increased the fecal concentrations of all bile acid 
species, whereas it decreased serum concentrations of secondary bile acids. 
Liraglutide induced a small increase in serum unconjugated bile acid 
concentrations without affecting fecal bile acid concentrations. No changes in 
fecal microbiota composition were observed with either treatment.
DISCUSSION: Colesevelam and liraglutide exhibit distinct effects on serum and 
fecal bile acid concentrations with colesevelam reducing serum concentrations of 
secondary bile acids and promoting fecal bile acid excretion, whereas 
liraglutide enhances serum concentrations of unconjugated bile acids, 
potentially through deceleration of small intestinal transit time allowing more 
time for passive absorption of bile acids.

Diarrheal diseases attributable to multidrug-resistant F4+ enterotoxigenic 
Escherichia coli (ETEC) are escalating in severity, posing significant risks to 
the health and safety of both humans and animals. This study used Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae EBY100 to display the FaeG subunit of F4 colonizing factor as an oral 
vaccine against F4+ ETEC infection. Mice were orally immunized twice with 108 
CFU of EBY100/pYD1-FaeG, followed by a challenge with F4+ ETEC EC6 on day 7 
post-immunization. The results showed that the recombinant strain 
EBY100/pYD1-FaeG orally enhanced the growth of the small intestine villi, 
significantly boosted the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, 
MUC2, and Claudin) (P < 0.05), and modulated the gut microbiota composition. 
Additionally, immunization with EBY100/pYD1-FaeG also upregulated the levels of 
IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ in the intestines of mice (P < 0.01), while serum IgG and 
fecal sIgA titer significantly increased (P < 0.05). These immune responses 
enhanced the capacity to fight against ETEC, leading to an increased survival 
rate of mice and relieved damage to tissues and organs of mice infection. In 
summary, the study suggested that the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
EBY100/pYD1-FaeG could effectively stimulate the immune response and generate 
specific antibodies against F4+ ETEC, showing its potential to serve as a 
subunit oral vaccine candidate for preventing F4+ ETEC infection.IMPORTANCEThe 
multidrug-resistant F4+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are the 
primary clinical pathogens responsible for post-weaning diarrhea in piglets, 
resulting in substantial economic losses in the pig farming industry. In the 
study, we developed an oral vaccine candidate, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
EBY100/pYD1-FaeG, to prevent diarrhea caused by multidrug-resistant F4+ ETEC. 
Oral administration of EBY100/pYD1-FaeG significantly enhanced immune responses, 
improved intestinal health, and provided protection against F4+ ETEC infection 
in mice. This approach offers a potential application prospect for preventing 
F4+ ETEC infections that lead to post-weaning diarrhea in clinical settings and 
provides a promising solution for addressing the growing threat of antibiotic 
resistance in bacterial pathogens.

Most studies on the human gut microbiome have focused on the bacterial fraction 
rather than fungal biomics, which as resulted in an incomplete understanding of 
the fungal microbiome. Recent advances in microbiota detection and 
next-generation sequencing technology have boosted an increase in research on 
fungi. Symbiotic fungi have become increasingly influential in health and 
disease and modulate various physiologic functions within the host. Fungal 
infections can result in high morbidity and mortality rates and are 
life-threatening in some immunocompromised patients. In addition to bacterial 
dysbiosis, alterations in fungal communities are important and have been linked 
to many diseases, including asthma, mental illness, and various cancers. When 
investigating cancer it is imperative to consider the role of fungi alongside 
viruses and bacteria. This review examined the impact of intestinal fungi and 
peri-tumor fungi on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and response to 
anticancer therapies. The review highlights the specific involvement of some 
fungal species in cancers include digestive tract tumors such as colorectal, 
pancreatic, liver, and gastric cancers, as well as non-digestive tract tumors 
such as lung, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, fungal 
mechanisms of action, including fungus-host recognition and immune regulation, 
biofilm formation, toxin and metabolite production in the tumor 
microenvironment, and the complex effects of fungus-bacteria interactions on 
tumorigenesis and development, highlight the significance of potential 
biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Metagenomic research faces a persistent challenge due to the low concordance 
across studies. While matching host confounders can mitigate the impact of 
individual differences, the influence of factors such as genetics, environment, 
and lifestyle habits on microbial profiles makes it exceptionally challenging to 
create fully matched cohorts. The microbial metabolic background, which 
modulates microbial composition, reflects a cumulative impact of host 
confounders, serving as an ideal baseline for microbial sample matching. In this 
study, we introduced miMatch, an innovative metagenomic sample-matching tool 
that uses microbial metabolic background as a comprehensive reference for 
host-related variables and employs propensity score matching to build 
case-control pairs, even in the absence of host confounders. In the simulated 
datasets, miMatch effectively eliminated individual metabolic background 
differences, thereby enhancing the accuracy of identifying differential 
microbial patterns and reducing false positives. Moreover, in real metagenomic 
data, miMatch improved result consistency and model generalizability across 
cohorts of the same disease. A user-friendly web server 
(https://www.biosino.org/iMAC/mimatch) has been established to promote the 
integration of multiple metagenomic cohorts, strengthening causal relationships 
in metagenomic research.
