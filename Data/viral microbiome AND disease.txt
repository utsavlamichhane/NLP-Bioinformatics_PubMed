The Apicomplexa are a phylum of single-celled eukaryotes that can infect humans 
and include the mosquito-borne parasite Plasmodium, the cause of malaria. 
Viruses that infect non-Plasmodium spp. disease-causing protozoa affect the 
pathogen life cycle and disease outcomes. However, only one RNA virus 
(Matryoshka RNA virus 1) has been identified in Plasmodium, and none have been 
identified in zoonotic Plasmodium species. The rapid expansion of the known RNA 
virosphere via metagenomic sequencing suggests that this dearth is due to the 
divergent nature of RNA viruses that infect protozoa. We leveraged newly 
uncovered data sets to explore the virome of human-infecting Plasmodium species 
collected in Sabah, east (Borneo) Malaysia. From this, we identified a highly 
divergent RNA virus in two human-infecting P. knowlesi isolates that is related 
to the unclassified group 'ormycoviruses'. By characterizing 15 additional 
ormycoviruses identified in the transcriptomes of arthropods, we show that this 
group of viruses exhibits a complex ecology as noninfecting passengers at the 
arthropod-mammal interface. With the addition of viral diversity discovered 
using the artificial intelligence-based analysis of metagenomic data, we also 
demonstrate that the ormycoviruses are part of a diverse and unclassified viral 
taxon. This is the first observation of an RNA virus in a zoonotic Plasmodium 
species. By linking small-scale experimental data to advances in large-scale 
virus discovery, we characterize the diversity and confirm the putative genomic 
architecture of an unclassified viral taxon. This approach can be used to 
further explore the virome of disease-causing Apicomplexa and better understand 
how protozoa-infecting viruses may affect parasite fitness, pathobiology, and 
treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND: At the end of 2021, an epidemic of reproductive abnormalities in 
cows occurred in Jilin Province, China, posing an urgent need for a rapid 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: To identify the cause of the disease, a total of 172 samples were 
collected from 21 dead calves and 45 aborting or pregnant cows in 10 farms 
across the province. Routine PCR or RT-PCR detection did not find any common 
abortion-related agents. We then employed the viromics-based precision diagnosis 
method to analyze these samples, and the read-based annotation showed signals of 
an Akabane disease virus (AKAV) in some libraries. To further identify the 
virus, nested RT-PCR detection revealed that 52.3% (11/21) of dead calves and 
26.6% (12/45) of cows were positive for the virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
partial fragments showed that the S segment of the virus was 100% identical to 
the Chinese strain TJ2016, but its M and L segments shared 94.3% and 96.5% 
identities with an Israeli strain.
CONCLUSIONS: The viromic and molecular results suggested that these animals were 
infected with a reassortant AKAV. Coupled with the clinical signs, the virus 
should be responsible for the epizootic, highlighting that molecular and 
serological surveys of the virus in cows during early pregnancy, as well as 
ecological investigation in its arthropod vectors, are necessary.

BACKGROUND: The rapid establishment and persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs 
is one of the main obstacles towards an HIV cure. While antiretroviral therapy 
supresses viral replication, it does not eradicate the latent reservoir of 
HIV-1-infected cells. Recent evidence suggests that the human microbiome, 
particularly the gut microbiome, may have the potential to modulate the HIV-1 
reservoir. However, literature is limited and the exact mechanisms underlying 
the role of the microbiome in HIV immunity and potential regulation of the viral 
reservoir remain poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we review updated knowledge on the associations between the human 
microbiome and HIV reservoir across different anatomical sites, including the 
gut, the lungs and blood. We provide an overview of the predominant taxa 
associated with prominent microbiome changes in the context of HIV infection. 
Based on the current evidence, we summarize the main study findings, with 
specific focus on consistent bacterial and related byproduct associations. 
Specifically, we address the contribution of immune activation and inflammatory 
signatures on HIV-1 persistence. Furthermore, we discuss possible scenarios by 
which bacterial-associated inflammatory mediators, related metabolites and host 
immune signatures may modulate the HIV reservoir size. Finally, we speculate on 
potential implications of microbiome-based therapeutics for future HIV-1 cure 
strategies, highlighting challenges and limitations inherent in this research 
field.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent advances, this review underscores the need for 
further research to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between 
the human microbiome and HIV reservoir. Further integrative multi-omics 
assessments and functional studies are crucial to test the outlined hypothesis 
and to identify potential therapeutic targets ultimately able to achieve an 
effective cure for HIV.

Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, play a crucial role in 
manipulating the gut microbiome, with implications for human health and disease. 
Despite the vast amount of data available on the human gut virome, the number of 
cultured phages that infect human gut bacteria-particularly obligate 
anaerobes-remains strikingly limited. Here, we summarize the resources and basic 
characteristics of phages that infect the human gut obligate anaerobe. We review 
various methods for isolating these phages and suggest a strategy for their 
isolation. Additionally, we outline their impact on the field of viral biology, 
their interactions with bacteria and humans, and their potential for disease 
intervention. Finally, we discuss the value and prospects of research on these 
phages, providing a comprehensive 'Roadmap' that sheds light on the 'dark 
matter' of phages that infect human gut obligate anaerobes.

Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have emerged as major global public 
health challenges, causing numerous infections and fatalities each year. 
However, current measures, including vaccines and treatments, are often limited 
or ineffective. This highlights the urgent need for novel preventive strategies 
to control the spread of key mosquito-borne viruses like DENV and ZIKV. In a 
recent study published in Science, Zhang et al. isolated a bacterium named 
Rosenbergiella_YN46 from the gut of field-caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in 
Yunnan Province, China. This commentary reviews their findings, published on 
April 19, 2024, which describe the symbiotic bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 and 
its ability to block flavivirus transmission, including both DENV and ZIKV. The 
bacterium shows promising potential for future dengue fever prevention and 
provides valuable insights into a novel biological approach for controlling 
mosquito-borne viral diseases.

Viral hepatitis is a public health problem, about 1 million people die due to 
complications of this viral disease, the etiological agents responsible for 
inducing cirrhosis and cellular hepatocarcinoma are HBV and HCV, both 
hepatotropic viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in most cases. The 
regulation of the microbiota performs many physiological functions, which can 
induce normal intestinal function and produce essential nutrients for the human 
body. Metabolites derived from gut microbiota or direct regulation of host 
immunity and metabolism have been reported to profoundly affect tumorigenesis in 
liver disease. If the microbiota is unbalanced, both exogenous and symbiotic 
microorganisms can affect a pathological process. It is well understood that the 
microbiota plays a role in viral diseases and infections, specifically the 
hepatic portal pathway has been linked to the gut-liver axis. In HBV and HCV 
infections, the altered bacterial representatives undergo a state of dysbiosis, 
with subsequent establishment of the pathobiome with overexpression of taxons 
such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus. 
This dysregulated microbiome induces a microenvironment conducive to the 
development of hepatic complications in patients with acute and chronic HBV and 
HCV infection, with subsequent dysregulation of cytokines IFN-α/β, TNF-α, IL-1β, 
TGF-β, IL-6 and IL-10, which alter the dysfunction and damage of the hepatic 
portal system. In view of the above, this review aimed to correlate the 
pathophysiological mechanisms in HBV and HCV infection, the dysregulation of the 
microbiome in patients infected with HBV and HCV, the most altered cytokines in 
the microbiome, and the most altered bacterial representatives in the pathobiome 
of infection.

BACKGROUND: Disporopsis, a member of the Liliaceae family and a perennial herb, 
is predominantly cultivated in southwestern and southeastern China. Its rhizome, 
referred to as Zhugenqi, serves as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb for the 
treatment of bone injuries. However, viral diseases have emerged as a 
significant challenge in the cultivation of Disporopsis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and characterize viruses 
present in diseased samples of Disporopsis spp. using high-throughput sequencing 
(HTS) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to enhance 
the understanding of the virome associated with Disporopsis and to inform 
diagnostic and control strategies for viral diseases in this plant.
METHODS: Diseased samples of Disporopsis spp. were subjected to HTS and RT-PCR 
for virus identification. A total of five viruses were detected, including three 
novel viruses and two known viruses. The novel viruses were provisionally named 
Disporopsis chlorotic stripe virus (DCSV), Disporopsis pernyi-associated 
partitivirus (DaPTV), and Disporopsis pernyi-associated lispi-like virus (DaLV). 
Sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm the 
novelty and taxonomic placement of these viruses.
RESULTS: DCSV exhibited polyprotein sequence identities ranging from 47.6% to 
83.6% with other potyviruses, with the highest identity (83.6%) shared with 
Polygonatum kingianum virus 5 (PKgV5). DaLV shared an amino acid sequence 
identity of 34.59% with maize suscal virus (MSV), and DaPTV shared an identity 
of 76.18-85.10% with Paris alphapartitivirus (ParAPV). Phylogenetic analyses 
supported the potential classification of the three novel viruses as new members 
of their respective genera. Two isolates of polygonatum mosaic-associated virus 
1 (PMaV1) were identified in Disporopsis for the first time, showing divergences 
of 96.33% and 98.86% from existing isolates. RT-PCR analysis of 67 Disporopsis 
field samples collected from four cities in China revealed that more than half 
of the samples tested positive for at least one of the five viruses. PMaV1 and 
DaLV were the most prevalent, detected in 22 and 34 out of the 67 samples, 
respectively. Other viruses were detected at low rates and/or had limited 
distribution.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the virome infecting Disporopsis 
and offers valuable information for the diagnosis and control of viral diseases 
in this plant. The identification of five viruses, including three potential new 
members of their respective genera, contributes to the understanding of the 
viral threats to Disporopsis cultivation.

The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we 
perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, 
and healthy controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene 
functions, and antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External 
metagenomic datasets from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were 
analyzed to validate our multi-biome findings. We found that Enterococcus 
faecium and Bifidobacterium spp. were enriched in both diseases. Enriched 
Escherichia coli was characteristic of CD and was linked to numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes involved in efflux pumps and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli 
virulence factors. Virome changes correlated with shifts in the bacteriome, 
including increased abundances of phages encoding pathogenic genes. 
Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in UC and CD, 
respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli had negative 
associations with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in CD. 
Multi-biome signatures and their interactions in UC and CD showed high 
similarities between Japan and other countries. Since bacteria, phages, and 
fungi formed multiple hubs of intra- or trans-kingdom networks with SCFA 
producers and pathobionts in UC and CD, an approach targeting the interaction 
network may hold therapeutic promise.

Escherichia coli is a commensal and opportunistic bacterium widely distributed 
around the world in different niches including intestinal of humans and animals, 
and its extraordinary genome plasticity led to the emergence of pathogenic 
strains causing a wide range of diseases. E. coli is one of the monitored 
species in maternity hospitals, being the main etiological agent of urogenital 
infections, endometriosis, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal diseases. This study 
presents a comprehensive analysis of E. coli isolates obtained from the maternal 
birth canal of healthy puerperant women 3-4 days after labor. According to whole 
genome sequencing data, 31 sequence types and six phylogenetic groups 
characterized the collection containing 53 isolates. The majority of the 
isolates belonged to the B2 phylogroup. The data also includes phenotypic and 
genotypic antibiotic resistance profiles, virulence factors, and plasmid 
replicons. Phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance testing did not 
demonstrate extensive drug resistance traits except for two multidrug-resistant 
E. coli isolates. The pathogenic factors revealed in silico were assessed with 
respect to CRISPR-element patterns. Multiparametric and correlation analyses 
were conducted to study the interrelation of different pathoadaptability 
factors, including antimicrobial resistance and virulence genomic determinants 
carried by the isolates under investigation. The data presented will serve as a 
valuable addition to further scientific investigations in the field of bacterial 
pathoadaptability, especially in studying the role of CRISPR/Cas systems in the 
E. coli genome plasticity and evolution.

Chlamys farreri is primarily cultivated in Japan, China, and South Korea. 
Although mass mortality of scallops has been occurring recently, likely caused 
by high temperatures or infectious diseases, the underlying cause remains 
unclear. Little is known regarding the viral diseases affecting them. Therefore, 
we explored DNA virus diversity in the mid-gut gland of C. farreri and compared 
it with that of seawater. C. farreri was cultivated at depths below 5 m from the 
sea surface in the coastal waters of South Korea and sampled from May to August 
2018. Different DNA viral communities were observed in both C. farreri and 
seawater. In C. farreri, prevalent groups included Mimiviridae (7%), Poxviridae 
(6%), and Phycodnaviridae (5%). Conversely, the dominant groups in seawater were 
Autographiviridae (20%), Kyanoviridae (12%), and Zobellviridae (10%). We 
identified C. farreri-specific viral communities and potentially infectious 
viruses, such as Ostreid herpesvirus 1 and Abalone herpesvirus 
Victoria/AUS/2009. Furthermore, C. farreri acts as a reservoir for various 
viruses, which impact microbial community dynamics and disease transmission in 
marine ecosystems. Understanding these viral communities is crucial to 
protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems by highlighting their role in the 
transmission of potential avian- and bivalve-specific viruses.

Kobuviruses (KoVs) are a group of small, non-enveloped RNA viruses classified in 
the genus Kobuvirus within the Picornaviridae family, comprising Aichivirus 
species A to F. KoVs have been identified in humans and several mammals, 
including domestic ungulates. This study investigated the presence of KoVs in a 
collection of bovine stool samples (n = 38) obtained from animals with enteritis 
or without clinical signs. By RT-PCR screening, KoV RNA was detected in 10/38 
animals (26.3%). Six of the ten positive animals had enteric signs. On sequence 
analysis of the amplicons, eight strains were related to species Aichivirus B, 
commonly identified in cattle. In contrast, two strains (ITA/2019/572-1 and 
ITA/2020/bovine/30-2), displayed the highest nt identity (up to 97.1%) to 
cattle, yak, and goat Aichivirus D strains. On whole genome analysis, strains 
ITA/2019/572-1 and ITA/2020/30-2 showed 88.9% nt identity to each other and 
87.8-90.3% nt to the bovine kobuvirus strain CHN/2021/ON730709 identified in 
China. Interestingly these three Aichivirus D strains showed a recombinant 
makeup, clustering with D1 genotype in the capsid region and with D2 genotype in 
the non-structural genes. These findings suggest that Aichivirus D KoVs are 
common components of livestock virome. Understanding the genetic diversity of 
KoVs in animals will be useful to improve the diagnostics and gather 
epidemiological data.

The lower female reproductive tract (FRT) hosts a complex microbial environment, 
including eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses (the virome), whose roles in health 
and disease are not fully understood. This review consolidates findings on FRT 
virome composition, revealing the presence of various viral families and noting 
significant gaps in knowledge. Understanding interactions between the virome, 
microbiome, and immune system will provide novel insights for preventing and 
managing lower genital tract disorders.

Recent advances highlight the role of gut virome, particularly phageome, in 
metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic 
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases, 
including hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and hyperlipidemia. 
While alterations in gut bacteria are well-documented, emerging evidence 
suggests that changes in gut viruses also contribute to these disorders. 
Bacteriophages, the most abundant gut viruses, influence bacterial populations 
through their lytic and lysogenic cycles, potentially modulating the gut 
ecosystem and metabolic pathways. Phage therapy, previously overshadowed by 
antibiotics, is experiencing renewed interest due to rising antibiotic 
resistance. It offers a novel approach to precisely edit the gut microbiota, 
with promising applications in metabolic diseases. In this review, we summarize 
recent discoveries about gut virome in metabolic disease patients, review 
preclinical and clinical studies of phage therapy on metabolic diseases as well 
as the breakthroughs and currently faced problems and concerns.

BACKGROUND: Ticks are significant vectors of pathogens, including viruses, 
bacteria, and protozoa. With approximately 900 tick species worldwide, many are 
expanding their geographical range due to changing socioeconomic and climate 
factors. The Danube Delta, one of Europe's largest wetlands, is an ecosystem 
that, despite its ecological importance, remains understudied concerning the 
risk of introducing new tick-borne viruses. This region serves as a critical 
habitat for migratory birds, which can carry ticks over long distances, 
potentially introducing exotic tick species and their pathogens into the local 
ecosystem. Hyalomma marginatum ticks, the primary vector of Crimean-Congo 
hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), are of particular concern due to their 
expanding presence in Europe and potential to spread other arboviruses. In 
addition to being the primary vector for CCHFV, Hyalomma sp. ticks are capable 
of transmitting other pathogens of medical and veterinary importance, including 
Dugbe virus, West Nile virus, African horse sickness virus, and Kyasanur forest 
disease virus. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the presence of Hyalomma 
sp. ticks while simultaneously surveilling arbovirus circulation in tick 
populations to mitigate the risk of arboviral outbreaks.
METHODS: In this work, we used an RNA sequencing technique to analyze the virome 
of H. marginatum ticks collected from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, 
Romania, one of the major bird migration hubs from Africa to Europe.
RESULTS: Among the viral taxa detected in H. marginatum ticks, sequences 
belonging to Volzhskoe tick virus (VTV), Balambala tick virus (BMTV) and Bole 
tick virus 4 (BTV4) were identified. In addition, we report the first 
identification of a novel Rhabdoviridae-related virus, Hyalomma marginatum 
rhabdovirus (HMRV). No CCHFV or any CCHFV-related nairovirus were detected in 
this study.
CONCLUSIONS: To summarize, detecting new viruses is essential for monitoring 
potential viral outbreaks. Our research expands the understanding of virus 
diversity in Eastern Europe, including the identification of novel viruses. This 
insight is crucial for monitoring viruses that may pose risks to both animal and 
human health, such as CCHFV.

BACKGROUND: Chronic gingivostomatitis in cats (FCGS) is a moderately to severely 
painful condition, potentially caused by inadequate immune response to oral 
antigenic stimulation. Salivary peptidome analysis can identify inflammatory 
protein mediators and pathways involved in oral mucosal immune activation and 
may indicate potential therapeutic options for FCGS.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the diversity and abundance of salivary peptides in cats 
with FCGS using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS).
ANIMALS: Thirty-two cats with FCGS and 18 healthy controls.
METHODS: Case-control cross-sectional study. We compared the salivary peptide 
profiles of diseased and healthy cats. The diagnosis of FCGS was confirmed by 
histopathology. Saliva samples were analyzed for viral infections using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) using MALDI-TOF 
MS, and peptide identification using nano LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Distinct clusters of peptide profiles were observed between groups. In 
FCGS, 26 salivary peptides were altered, including apolipoprotein A1, nuclear 
receptor subfamily 1 group I member 3, fibrinogen alpha chain, interleukin 2 
receptor gamma, interleukin 23 receptor, hemoglobin subunit alpha, and serpin 
peptidase inhibitor clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin) member 12, 
protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, and cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 10 
subunit. Protein-anti-inflammatory drug interaction networks were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Peptide mass fingerprint and peptide 
profiles identified distinct clusters between FCGS and healthy cats. The 9 novel 
salivary peptide markers were associated with the JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways 
and immune responses. These potentially noninvasive biomarkers may facilitate 
understanding of FCGS pathophysiology and guide future therapeutic research.

Integrative metagenomics and metabolomics reveal age-associated gut microbiota 
and metabolite alterations in experimental COVID-19.

Aging is a key contributor of morbidity and mortality during acute viral 
pneumonia. The potential role of age-associated dysbiosis on disease outcomes is 
still elusive. In the current study, we used high-resolution shotgun 
metagenomics and targeted metabolomics to characterize SARS-CoV-2-associated 
changes in the gut microbiota from young (2-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) 
hamsters, a valuable model of COVID-19. We show that age-related dysfunctions in 
the gut microbiota are linked to disease severity and long-term sequelae in 
older hamsters. Our data also reveal age-specific changes in the composition and 
metabolic activity of the gut microbiota during both the acute phase (day 7 
post-infection, D7) and the recovery phase (D22) of infection. Aged hamsters 
exhibited the most notable shifts in gut microbiota composition and plasma 
metabolic profiles. Through an integrative analysis of metagenomics, 
metabolomics, and clinical data, we identified significant associations between 
bacterial taxa, metabolites and disease markers in the aged group. On D7 (high 
viral load and lung epithelial damage) and D22 (body weight loss and fibrosis), 
numerous amino acids, amino acid-related molecules, and indole derivatives were 
found to correlate with disease markers. In particular, a persistent decrease in 
phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and indoleacetic acid in aged animals 
positively correlated with poor recovery of body weight and/or lung fibrosis by 
D22. In younger hamsters, several bacterial taxa ( Eubacterium , 
Oscillospiraceae , Lawsonibacter ) and plasma metabolites (carnosine and 
cis-aconitic acid) were associated with mild disease outcomes. These findings 
support the need for age-specific microbiome-targeting strategies to more 
effectively manage acute viral pneumonia and long-term disease outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a 
global health crisis, with clinical manifestations including those suggesting 
injury to various organs such as the ovaries, which implies that it extends 
beyond respiratory infections. Changes in gut microbiota may exhibit 
correlations with the mechanisms and stages of severity in COVID-19, as well as 
a link with sex hormones, embryo development, and pregnancy. Controlled ovarian 
stimulation (COS) is used to induce the development of multiple high-quality 
follicles during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our research aimed to investigate 
whether patients infected with COVID-19 have altered gut microbiota compositions 
that would affect the outcomes of COS.
METHODS: Twenty-one healthy females and seventeen patients with COVID-19 were 
enrolled. Samples were sequenced for gut microbiota identification through 16 S 
rRNA V3-V4 region, including species annotation, community diversity, and 
community functions.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of in 
IVF cycle outcomes and laboratory parameters. Patients with COVID-19 and healthy 
women showed no significant difference in the total number of available 
blastocyst embryos. Furthermore, the gut microbiota alpha diversity index in the 
COVID-19 group were markedly reduced compared to those of healthy females. 
Comparing the COVID-19 group to the controls, the gut microbiota dysbiosis 
decreased levels of Ruminococcus, and Agathobater, and elevated levels of 
Achromobacter and Raistonia. Finally, we identified a series of microbial 
functional characteristics, including membrane transport and carbohydrate 
metabolism, that exhibited significant disparities between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the COVID-19 group exhibited significant disparities in 
the gut microbiota composition compared to the healthy women during COS. 
However, the IVF outcomes did not show any significant differences between the 
two groups. Collectively, our speculation suggests that SARS-COV-2 infection may 
alter the gut microbiota without impacting IVF outcomes.

Why HPV16? Why, now, HPV42? How the discovery of HPV42 in rare cancers provides 
an opportunity to challenge our understanding about the transition between 
health and disease for common members of the healthy microbiota.

Scientific Research (CNRS), Montpellier, France.

In 2022, a bioinformatic, agnostic approach identified HPV42 as causative agent 
of a rare cancer, later confirmed experimentally. This unexpected association 
offers an opportunity to reconsider our understanding about papillomavirus 
infections and cancers. We have expanded our knowledge about the diversity of 
papillomaviruses and the diseases they cause.Yet we still lack answers to 
fundamental questions, such as what makes HPV16 different from the closely 
related HPV31 or HPV33; or why the very divergent HPV13 and HPV32 cause focal 
epithelial hyperplasia, while HPV6 or HPV42 do not, despite their evolutionary 
relatedness. Certain members of the healthy skin microbiota are associated to 
rare clinical conditions. We propose that a focus on cellular phenotypes, most 
often transient and influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, may help 
understand the continuum between health and disease. A conceptual switch is 
required towards an interpretation of biology as a diversity of states connected 
by transition probabilities, rather than quasi-deterministic programs. Under 
this perspective, papillomaviruses may only trigger malignant transformation 
when specific viral genotypes interact with precise cellular states. Drawing on 
Canguilhem's concepts of normal and pathological, we suggest that understanding 
the transition between fluid cellular states can illuminate how commensal-like 
infections transition from benign to malignant.

BACKGROUND: Evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that intestinal microbiome 
can inhibit viral infection. However, our knowledge of the signaling pathways 
and identity of specific commensal microbes that mediate the antiviral response 
is limited. Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful animal model for study of 
vertebrate-microbiota interactions. Here, a rhabdoviral infection model in 
zebrafish allows us to investigate the modes of action of microbiome-mediated 
antiviral effect.
RESULTS: We observed that oral antibiotics-treated and germ-free zebrafish 
exhibited greater spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection. 
Mechanistically, depletion of the intestinal microbiome alters TLR2-Myd88 
signaling and blunts neutrophil response and type I interferon (IFN) antiviral 
innate immunity. Through 16S rRNA sequencing of the intestinal contents from 
control and antibiotic(s)-treated fish, we identified a single commensal 
bacterial species, Cetobacterium somerae, that can restore the TLR2- and 
neutrophil-dependent type I IFN response to restrict SVCV infection in 
gnotobiotic zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that C. somerae exopolysaccharides 
(CsEPS) was the effector molecule that engaged TLR2 to mediate the type I 
IFN-dependent antiviral function.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results suggest a conserved role of intestinal 
microbiome in regulating type I IFN antiviral response among vertebrates and 
reveal that the intestinal microbiome inhibits viral infection through a 
CsEPS-TLR2-type I IFN signaling axis in zebrafish. Video Abstract.

The red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is the second most widely cultured 
crustacean globally. As a highly invasive species with a worldwide distribution, 
P. clarkii presents a substantial risk for the transmission of viral pathogens 
to native aquatic organisms. Recently, the emergence of growth retardation 
disease (GRD) in P. clarkii has led to significant production declines and 
economic losses. A comprehensive viromic analysis could offer valuable insights 
into the potential viral pathogens harbored by P. clarkii. Here we 
systematically examined the RNA viromes of healthy and GRD-affected P. clarkii 
collected from Qianjiang, China. Our investigation identified a total of 1729 
viral species across 21 known viral taxa, with 1603 species being previously 
unreported. The orders Picornavirales, Tolivirales, and Nodamuvirales were 
predominant in both species count and relative abundance. Moreover, seven 
viruses exhibited higher abundance in GRD-affected P. clarkii compared to 
healthy individuals. Our work uncovers an unexpectedly diverse RNA viral 
community within P. clarkii and identifies potential viral pathogens associated 
with GRD in this species.

Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or 
over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the 
microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized 
that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives 
might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In 
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and 
indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many 
proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), 
while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and 
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of 
acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A 
similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan 
and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while 
C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. 
Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of 
genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. 
anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly 
lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy 
controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell 
proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes 
(STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while 
IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex 
vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 
associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest 
that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut 
microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 
infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening 
patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help 
identify at-risk individuals.

Mounting evidence suggests that the gut-heart axis is critical in the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The gut serves as the primary pathway 
through which Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infects its host, leading to acute viral 
myocarditis (AVMC). However, little is known about the role of gut microflora 
and its metabolites in the development of AVMC. The AVMC model was established 
by intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in mice. Then, 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) 
gene sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) untargeted metabolomics profiling were performed to 
analyze the microflora composition and metabolic profile of colonic contents. 
Compared to the Control mice, the AVMC mice displayed a significant reduction in 
gut microflora richness and diversity, as revealed by an increased abundance of 
Proteobacteria and a decreased abundance of Cyanobacteria and Desulfobacterota. 
LEfSe analysis indicated that the main genera differing between the two groups 
were Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, 
Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Odoribacter. Based on the criterion of OPLS-DA 
VIP ≥ 1.0 and p-value < 0.05, a total of 198 differential metabolites (DMs) were 
identified in the gut, including 79 upregulated and 119 downregulated 
metabolites, of which lipids and lipid-like molecules accounted for the largest 
proportion. Notably, both altered gut bacterial taxa and metabolites were 
significantly enriched in the Lipid metabolism pathway, with Traumatic acid 
(TA), Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) being the key DMs in the pathway. Additionally, 
significant positive correlations (|r| > 0.80 and p < 0.05) were found between 
TA levels and Anaerotruncus and Bilophila abundance, between EPA levels and 
Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 abundance, and between DHA levels and 
Escherichia-Shigella abundance, respectively. CVB3 infection leads to notable 
alterations in gut microflora composition and its metabolic profile, which may 
participate in AVMC development. Our findings provide important clues for future 
in-depth studies on AVMC etiology.

Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening 
hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by inborn errors of cytotoxicity. Patients 
with biallelic PRF1 null mutations (encoding perforin) usually develop excessive 
immune cell activation, hypercytokinemia, and life-threatening immunopathology 
in the first 6 months of life, often without an apparent infectious trigger. In 
contrast, perforin-deficient (PKO) mice only develop HLH after systemic 
infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We hypothesized that 
restricted microbe-immune cell interactions due to specific pathogen-free (SPF) 
housing might explain the need for this specific viral trigger in PKO mice. To 
investigate the influence of a "wild" microbiome in PKO mice, we fostered PKO 
newborns with Wildling microbiota ('PKO-Wildlings') and monitored them for signs 
of HLH. PKO-Wildlings survived long-term without spontaneous disease. Also, 
systemic infection with vaccinia virus did not reach the threshold of immune 
activation required to trigger HLH in PKO-Wildlings. Interestingly, after 
infection with LCMV, PKO-Wildlings developed an altered HLH pattern. This 
included lower IFN-γ serum levels along with improved IFN-γ-driven anemia, but 
more elevated levels of IL-17 and increased liver inflammation compared with 
PKO-SPF mice. Thus, wild microbiota alone is not sufficient to trigger HLH in 
PKO mice, but host-microbe interactions shape inflammatory cytokine patterns, 
thereby influencing manifestations of HLH immunopathology.

Microbial interactions mediating colonization resistance play key roles within 
the human microbiome, shaping susceptibility to infection from birth. To gain 
insight into microbiome-mediated defenses and respiratory pathogen colonization 
dynamics, we sequenced and analyzed nasal (n=229) and oral (n=210) microbiomes 
with associated health/environmental data from our Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort 
at age 24-months. Participants with early-life lower respiratory tract infection 
(LRTI) were more likely to be formula-fed, attend daycare, and experience 
wheezing. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing with detection of viral and bacterial 
respiratory pathogens revealed nasal microbiome composition to associate with 
prior LRTI - namely lower alpha diversity, depletion of Prevotella, and 
enrichment of Moraxella catarrhalis including drug-resistant strains. Prevotella 
originating from healthy microbiomes had higher biosynthetic gene cluster 
abundance and exhibited contact-independent inhibition of M. catarrhalis, 
suggesting interbacterial competition impacts nasal pathogen colonization. This 
work advances understanding of protective host-microbial interactions occurring 
in airway microbiomes that alter infection susceptibility in early-life.

Viruses are implicated to play key roles as biogeochemical mediators and 
ecological drivers in freshwater ecosystems. However, the dynamics of viruses 
and host associations throughout the seasons and during blooming periods in 
eutrophic freshwater ecosystems remain poorly understood. From the water 
microbiomes of planktonic biomass from Lake Taihu, a large eutrophic freshwater 
lake in China that experiences annual Microcystis-dominated harmful algal blooms 
(HABs), we recovered 41,997 unique viral clusters spanning a wide taxonomic 
range, including 15,139 Caudovirales clusters targeting bacteria and 1,044 NCLDV 
clusters targeting eukaryotes. The viral community exhibited clear seasonal 
succession, driven primarily by microbial communities (particularly 
Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes) and environmental factors (mainly nutrients 
and temperature). Host prediction revealed that viral infection had a more 
distinct impact on bacteria-driven nitrogen pathways than on phosphate cycling. 
HAB-induced variations in microbial composition and environmental conditions 
affected viral strategies including viral lifestyles, host range, and 
virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (vAMGs) distributions. Viruses infecting 
Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria showed an enhanced lysogenic lifestyle and a 
narrower host range during HAB peak in summer, while viruses infecting 
Bacteroidota adopted an opposite strategy. Notably, vAMGs were most abundant 
before the HAB outbreak in spring, compensating for bacterial metabolic 
processes of their hosts such as carbohydrates metabolism, photosynthesis, and 
phosphate regulation. The findings highlight the intricate relationships between 
viruses, host microbes, and the bloom-associated environment, underscoring the 
important biochemical roles viruses play in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in 762 million infections worldwide from 
2020 to date, of which approximately ten percent are suffering from the effects 
after infection in 2019 (COVID-19) [1, 40]. In Germany, it is now assumed that 
at least one million people suffer from post-COVID condition with long-term 
consequences. These have been previously reported in diseases like Myalgic 
Encephalomyelitis (ME) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Symptoms show a 
changing variability and recent surveys in the COVID context indicate that 10-30 
% of outpatients, 50 to 70% of hospitalised patients suffer from sequelae. 
Recent data suggest that only 13% of all ill people were completely free of 
symptoms after recovery [3, 9]. Current hypotheses consider chronic 
inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, latent viral persistence, autoimmunity, 
changes of the human microbiome or multilocular sequelae in various organ system 
after infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is applied since 1957 for 
heart surgery, scuba dive accidents, CO intoxication, air embolisms and 
infections with anaerobic pathogens. Under hyperbaric pressure, oxygen is 
physically dissolved in the blood in higher concentrations and reaches levels 
four times higher than under normobaric oxygen application. Moreover, the 
alternation of hyperoxia and normoxia induces a variety of processes at the 
cellular level, which improves oxygen supply in areas of locoregional hypoxia. 
Numerous target gene effects on new vessel formation, anti-inflammatory and 
anti-oedematous effects have been demonstrated [74]. The provision of 
intermittently high, local oxygen concentrations increases repair and 
regeneration processes and normalises the predominance of hyperinflammation. At 
present time only one prospective, randomized and placebo-controlled study 
exists with positive effects on global cognitive function, attention and 
executive function, psychiatric symptoms and pain interference. In conclusion, 
up to this date HBO is the only scientifically proven treatment in a prospective 
randomized controlled trial to be effective for cognitive improvement, 
regeneration of brain network and improvement of cardiac function. HBOT may have 
not only theoretical but also potential impact on targets of current 
pathophysiology of Post COVID condition, which warrants further scientific 
studies in patients.

IMPORTANCE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is linked with alterations 
in the gut microbiome. The influence of adenotonsillectomy (AT), a primary 
intervention for OSA, on gut microbiota dynamics relative to disease severity 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of OSA severity and AT on 
the gut microbiome in pediatric patients.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 55 pediatric patients treated with AT for OSA.
INTERVENTION: Total tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive evaluations included in-laboratory 
polysomnography and 16S rRNA gut microbiome profiling at baseline, and again at 
3rd and 12thmonth following surgery.
RESULTS: Initial findings showed uniform α-diversity across different severities 
of OSA, while β-diversity was significantly elevated in the severe OSA subgroup. 
Certain gut microbiota taxa (Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Ruminococcaceae 
UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Alloprevotella, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, 
Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Lactobacillus murinus, and Prevotella nigrescens) were 
found to inversely correlate with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Significant 
post-AT improvements in AHI and other polysomnographic metrics were observed. 
Notably, AHI changes post-AT were positively associated with microbial 
α-diversity (species richness), β-diversity, and specific bacterial taxa 
(Enterobacter, Parasutterella, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Bacteroides plebeius 
DSM 17135), but negatively with other taxa (Fusicatenibacter, Bifidobacterium, 
UBA1819, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. Longum, and 
Parabacteroides distasonis) and specific metabolic pathways (purine metabolism, 
transcription factors, and type II diabetes mellitus). The postoperative 
patterns of α- and β-diversity mirrored baseline values.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study documents significant changes in the gut 
microbiome of pediatric patients after AT, including variations in α- and 
β-diversities, bacterial communities, and inferred metabolic functions. These 
changes suggest a potential association between the surgical intervention and 
microbiome alterations, although further studies are necessary to discern the 
specific contributions of AT amidst possible confounding factors such as 
antibiotic use.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome dysbiosis and related immune dysfunction have been 
associated with the pathogenesis of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in 
infants with neonatal cholestasis (NC) as previously reported by us. However, 
the interaction of a perturbed microbiome, HCMV infection, and dysregulated 
immunity leading to exacerbation of disease severity has not been investigated 
so far. In this study, we examined the association of gut microbiome, host 
inflammatory and homeostatic markers that are likely to govern increased 
pathogenesis of NC in HCMV infected IgM positive infants (N = 15) compared to 
IgM negative (N = 15) individuals. Stool samples of HCMV infected infants and 
age-matched healthy controls (N = 10) were assessed for gut bacteria-derived 
metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
cytokines and markers of gut barrier integrity. Data were correlated with 
previously determined gut microbiome composition and frequency of immune cell 
subsets. Finally, validation of clinical potential was undertaken by principal 
component analysis (PCA) of integrated data to delineate the spectrum of 
clinical pathology.
RESULTS: Significantly lower levels of SCFAs and elevated fecal levels of 
soluble inflammatory mediators were observed in IgM positive HCMV infected 
infants. Further, increased plasma LPS levels and markers of gut permeability, 
suggestive of microbial translocation due to a 'leaky gut' were observed in HCMV 
infected IgM positive group. PCA of integrated data revealed clearly disparate 
profiles representative of IgM positive, IgM negative, and uninfected healthy 
states.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the utility of an integrated approach involving 
dysregulated microbiome-immune axis for gaining a better understanding of 
pathogenesis associated with HCMV infection in NC.

BACKGROUND: Infection is the cause of diarrhoea, and rotaviruses and 
adenoviruses are important pathogens in children.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 144,067 children with diarrhoea 
between 2014 and 2023 in China. We used the colloidal gold method to detect 
intestinal adenovirus and rotavirus A antigens in faeces. The epidemiological 
characteristics of these viruses and the impact of meteorological factors on 
them were analysed before and after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic.
RESULTS: During this decade, the positive rate of adenovirus infection was 
6.41%, while the positive rate of rotavirus A infection was 11.81%, higher than 
that of adenovirus infection. The positive rate of adenovirus and rotavirus A 
coinfection was 1.92%. The positive rates of adenovirus, rotavirus A and 
coinfection showed a fluctuating trend, and suddenly decreased in 2020. There 
was an apparent decrease of positive rate of rotavirus A, with a decrease of 
57.27%, during 2020-2023. Surprisingly, the positive rate of adenovirus 
infection exceeded that of rotavirus A infection in 2021 and 2023. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of female patients and children over two years 
of age infected with adenovirus or rotavirus A increased, while the proportion 
of cases in winter decreased. In addition, we found that the positive rate of 
rotavirus A infection was related to average temperature and sunshine, and the 
positive rate of adenovirus and rotavirus A coinfection was only related to 
sunshine. However, these correlations disappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the recent prevalence of adenovirus and 
rotavirus A infections in children with diarrhoea in south-central China and 
provided a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of viral diarrhoea.

BACKGROUND: Bats (Order Chiroptera) are an important reservoir of emerging 
zoonotic microbes, including viruses of public health concern such as 
henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and SARS-related coronaviruses. Despite the 
continued discovery of new viruses in bat populations, a significant proportion 
of these viral agents remain uncharacterized, highlighting the imperative for 
additional research aimed at elucidating their evolutionary relationship and 
taxonomic classification.
RESULTS: In order to delve deeper into the viral reservoir hosted by bats, the 
present study employed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze 
13,105 swab samples obtained from various locations in China. Analysis of 378 
sample pools revealed the presence of 846 vertebrate-associated viruses. 
Subsequent thorough examination, adhering to the International Committee on 
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) criteria for virus classification, identified a total 
of 120 putative viral species with the potential to emerge as novel viruses, 
comprising a total of 294 viral strains. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved 
genomic regions indicated the novel virus exhibited a diverse array of viral 
lineages and branches, some of which displayed close genetic relationships to 
known human and livestock pathogens, such as poxviruses and pestiviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates the breadth of DNA and RNA viruses harbored 
by bats, delineating several novel evolutionary lineages and offering 
significant contributions to virus taxonomy. Furthermore, the identification of 
hitherto unknown viruses with relevance to human and livestock health 
underscores the importance of this study in encouraging infectious disease 
monitoring and management efforts in both public health and veterinary contexts.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that previously healthy infants < 90 days of age with 
late-onset sepsis (LOS) have disturbances of the gut microbiome with yet 
undefined specific immunological patterns.
METHODS: We performed a prospective single-center convenience sample study 
between January 2019 and July 2021 in a case-control design. Routine diagnostics 
included conventional cultures (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine), PCRs and 
inflammatory markers in infants aged < 90 days with clinical LOS. We 
additionally analyzed blood lymphocyte subsets including CD4 + CD25 + forkhead 
box protein (FoxP3)+ Tregs and performed 16 S rRNA sequencing of stool samples, 
both compared to age-matched healthy controls. Results were adjusted for 
potential confounders that may influence microbial composition.
RESULTS: 51 infants with fever and clinical LOS were enrolled. Bacterial sepsis 
was diagnosed in n = 24 (47.1%) and viral infection in n = 13 (25.5%) infants, 
whereas in 14 (27.3%) infants the cause of fever remained undetermined. When 
compared to healthy controls, the gut microbiome of LOS infants at disease onset 
was characterized by a shift in community composition, specifically, decreased 
abundance of B. longum and an increase of Bacteroidia spp. Intriguingly, the 
abundance of B. longum negatively correlated with the frequency of blood 
CD4-positive cells in healthy controls but not in infants with LOS. At one year 
of age, we observed microbiome differences in infants with history of LOS when 
compared to healthy controls, such as an increased gut microbial diversity.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest potential signatures of the microbiome-immunity 
interplay in infants with LOS, which should be investigated further as possible 
targets for prevention.

Rational treatment of acute rhinosinusitis in the context of increasing 
antibiotic resistance.

Arcimowicz M(1).

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diseases in the population, both 
in primary and specialist otolaryngological care. It is also responsible for a 
disturbingly high percentage of prescribed antibiotic therapy, regardless of the 
etiology of the disease. Despite the fact that acute viral and acute postviral 
rhinosinusitis dominate among the phenotypes of acute rhinosinusitis, and the 
development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis occurs in only 0.5-2% of all cases 
in adults and 5-10% in children, antibiotics still remain an important element 
of treatment, despite alarming data on the growing antibiotic resistance and the 
adverse effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome, leading to dysbiosis. The 
discovery of antibiotics was one of the greatest achievements of modern 
medicine, but their inappropriate use leads to the gradual increase in the 
phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, considered one of the most serious public 
health problems, recognized by the WHO as one of the 10 greatest threats to 
human health in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. The unjustified use of 
antibiotics in outpatient care is the key to the growth of this problem, in 
parallel with the lack of patient compliance. The COVID pandemic has intensified 
this unfavourable trend. That is why the knowledge of antibiotic stewardship is 
so important. According to the guidelines, in the therapy of acute 
rhinosinusitis, symptomatic and anti-inflammatory treatment dominates, and 
antibiotic therapy has very strictly defined and limited indications. The latest 
guidelines also recommend herbal medicines, including BNO 1016, in the treatment 
of acute viral and postviral rhinosinusitis. Available studies indicate that it 
has a beneficial effect not only on shortening the duration of the disease and 
reducing symptoms, but also reduces the need for antibiotic treatment in acute 
rhinosinusitis. Complications of acute rhinosinusitis are relatively rare and 
are not related to taking antibiotics.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating 
disease with a complex clinical presentation and an unknown etiology. Various 
viral infections have been proposed as potential triggers of ME/CFS onset, but 
no specific pathogen has been identified in all cases of postinfectious ME/CFS. 
The symptomatology of the postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, or long COVID, 
mirrors that of ME/CFS, with nearly half of long COVID patients meeting ME/CFS 
diagnostic criteria. The influx of newly diagnosed patients has reinvigorated 
interest in ME/CFS pathogenesis research, with an emphasis on viral triggers. 
This review summarizes the current understanding of ME/CFS research on viral 
triggers, including blood virome screening studies. To further elucidate the 
molecular basis of ME/CFS, there is a need to develop innovative bioinformatics 
tools capable of analyzing complex virome data and integrating multiomics 
information.

Patients with COVID-19 under invasive mechanical ventilation are at higher risk 
of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), associated with increased 
healthcare costs, and unfavorable prognosis. The underlying mechanisms of this 
phenomenon have not been thoroughly dissected. Therefore, this study attempted 
to bridge this gap by performing a lung microbiota analysis and evaluating the 
host immune responses that could drive the development of VAP. In this 
prospective cohort study, mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Nasal swabs (NS), endotracheal aspirates 
(ETA), and blood samples were collected initially within 12 h of intubation and 
again at 72 h post-intubation. Plasma samples underwent cytokine and metabolomic 
analyses, while NS and ETA samples were sequenced for lung microbiome 
examination. The cohort was categorized based on the development of VAP. Data 
analysis was conducted using RStudio version 4.3.1. In a study of 36 COVID-19 
patients on mechanical ventilation, significant differences were found in the 
nasal and pulmonary microbiome, notably in Staphylococcus and 
Enterobacteriaceae, linked to VAP. Patients with VAP showed a higher SARS-CoV-2 
viral load in respiratory samples, elevated neutralizing antibodies, and reduced 
inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-δ, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α, 
and CCL4. Metabolomic analysis revealed changes in 22 metabolites in non-VAP 
patients and 27 in VAP patients, highlighting D-Maltose-Lactose, 
Histidinyl-Glycine, and various phosphatidylcholines, indicating a metabolic 
predisposition to VAP. This study reveals a critical link between respiratory 
microbiome alterations and ventilator-associated pneumonia in COVID-19 patients 
with higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in respiratory samples, elevated neutralizing 
antibodies, and reduced inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-δ, IL-1β, 
IL-12p70, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL4. These findings provide novel insights 
into the underlying mechanisms of VAP, with potential implications for 
management and prevention.

INTRODUCTION: The gut microbiota is believed to be directly involved in the 
etiology and development of chronic liver diseases. However, the holistic 
characterization of the gut bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome in patients with 
chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis (CHB-LF) remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the multi-kingdom gut microbiome (i.e., 
bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome) of 25 CHB-LF patients and 28 healthy 
individuals through whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of their stool samples.
RESULTS: We found that the gut bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome of CHB-LF 
patients were fundamentally altered, characterized by a panel of 110 
differentially abundant bacterial species, 16 differential fungal species, and 
90 differential viruses. The representative CHB-LF-enriched bacteria included 
members of Blautia_A (e.g., B. wexlerae, B. massiliensis, and B. obeum), Dorea 
(e.g., D. longicatena and D. formicigenerans), Streptococcus, 
Erysipelatoclostridium, while some species of Bacteroides (e.g., B. finegoldii 
and B. thetaiotaomicron), Faecalibacterium (mainly F. prausnitzii), and 
Bacteroides_A (e.g., B. plebeius_A and B. coprophilus) were depleted in 
patients. Fungi such as Malassezia spp. (e.g., M. japonica and M. sympodialis), 
Candida spp. (e.g., C. parapsilosis), and Mucor circinelloides were more 
abundant in CHB-LF patients, while Mucor irregularis, Phialophora verrucosa, 
Hortaea werneckii, and Aspergillus fumigatus were decreases. The CHB-LF-enriched 
viruses contained 18 Siphoviridae, 12 Myoviridae, and 1 Podoviridae viruses, 
while the control-enriched viruses included 16 Siphoviridae, 9 Myoviridae, 2 
Quimbyviridae, and 1 Podoviridae_crAss-like members. Moreover, we revealed that 
the CHB-LF-associated gut multi-kingdom signatures were tightly interconnected, 
suggesting that they may act together on the disease. Finally, we showed that 
the microbial signatures were effective in discriminating the patients from 
healthy controls, suggesting the potential of gut microbiota in the prediction 
of CHB-LF and related diseases.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our findings delineated the fecal bacteriome, 
mycobiome, and virome landscapes of the CHB-LF microbiota and provided 
biomarkers that will aid in future mechanistic and clinical intervention 
studies.

Gut microbial dysbiosis, especially bacteriome, has been implicated in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, nonbacterial members of the gut microbiome in 
AD, such as the mycobiome, archaeome, and virome, are unexplored. Here, we 
perform higher-resolution shotgun metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples 
collected longitudinally from a mouse model of AD to investigate longitudinal 
and multi-kingdom gut microbiome profiling. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 
fecal samples from AD mice and healthy mice returns 41,222 bacterial, 414 
fungal, 1836 archaeal, and 1916 viral species across all time points. The 
ecological network pattern of the gut microbiome in AD mice is characterized by 
more complex bacterial-bacterial interactions and fungal-fungal interactions, as 
well as simpler archaeal-archaeal interactions and viral-viral interactions. The 
development of AD is accompanied by multi-kingdom shifts in the gut microbiome 
composition, as evidenced by the identification of 1177 differential bacterial, 
84 differential fungal, 59 differential archaeal, and 10 differential viral 
species between healthy and AD mice across all time points. In addition, the 
functional potential of the gut microbiome is partially altered in the

BACKGROUND: The choice of de novo assembler for high-throughput sequencing (HTS) 
data remains a pivotal factor in the HTS-based discovery of viral pathogens. 
This study assessed de novo assemblers, namely Trinity, SPAdes, and MEGAHIT for 
HTS datasets generated on the Illumina platform from 23 apple samples, 
representing 15 exotic and indigenous apple varieties and a rootstock. The 
assemblers were compared based on assembly quality metrics, including the 
largest contig, total assembly length, genome coverage, and N50.
RESULTS: MEGAHIT was most efficient assembler according to the metrics evaluated 
in this study. By using multiple assemblers, near-complete genome sequences of 
citrus concave gum-associated virus (CCGaV), apple rubbery wood virus 1 
(ARWV-1), ARWV-2, apple necrotic mosaic virus (ApNMV), apple mosaic virus, apple 
stem pitting virus, apple stem grooving virus, apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, 
apple hammerhead viroid and apple scar skin viroid were reconstructed. These 
viruses were further confirmed through Sanger sequencing in different apple 
cultivars. Among them, CCGaV, ARWV-1 and ARWV-2 were recorded from apples in 
India for the first time. The analysis of virus richness revealed that ApNMV was 
dominant, followed by ARWV-1 and CCGaV. Moreover, MEGAHIT identified novel 
single-nucleotide variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlight the crucial role of assembly methods in 
reconstructing near-complete apple virus genomes from the Illumina reads. This 
study emphasizes the significance of employing multiple assemblers for de novo 
virus genome assembly in vegetatively propagated perennial fruit crops.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the virome diversity of the SLE 
disease and the association between viral infections and the disease.
METHODS: SLE-related RNA-Seq data were retrieved from public databases. A 
rigorous computational workflow was employed to identify the human viruses. 
Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were 
conducted in R.
RESULTS: We identified ten human virus species from 826 RNA-Seq samples of human 
blood, comprising 688 SLE patients and 138 healthy controls. Eight of the ten 
virus species exhibited higher positive rates in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls, with Human betaherpesvirus 5 (HHV5) having the highest 
positive rate (4.1%) and being exclusively detected in SLE samples. The virus 
abundances were low and comparable in both SLE patients and healthy controls. 
Analysis of the antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in samples showed 
higher ISG expression levels in HHV4 and HHV5-positive samples compared to 
virus-negative samples. Several genes that were up-regulated in SLE patients 
were further up-regulated after HHV5 infection, and they were mainly enriched in 
immune response-related biological processes. Additionally, the expression 
levels of several marker genes of SLE severity were compared between 
HHV5-positive and virus-negative SLE patients, suggesting that HHV5 infection 
may be associated with aggravated SLE disease.
DISCUSSION: We found that SLE patients are more susceptible to viral infections 
than healthy individuals. Viral infections, such as HHV5, may be associated with 
aggravated SLE disease. This study deepens our understanding of the association 
between viruses and SLE and provides new insights into prevention and control of 
the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a group of 
heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by specific clinical 
features and, frequently, skeletal muscle inflammation. Specific subtypes of 
IIMs can be characterized by myositis-specific autoantibodies and are associated 
with distinct clinical phenotypes. Here, we focus on anti-melanoma 
differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)-positive myositis and anti-signal 
recognition particle (SRP)-positive myositis, both of which exhibit seasonality 
but lack known environmental triggers.
METHODS: We employed Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing to profile serum 
antibodies against the human proteome, the human virome, and a comprehensive 
enterovirus library. We analyzed sera from 57 patients with anti-MDA5 
autoantibodies and 57 patients with anti-SRP autoantibodies, as well as 57 
healthy controls. All groups were matched for age, sex, and race.
RESULTS: Our autoantibody profiling results define specific immunogenic regions 
within the MDA5 and SRP autoantigens. We also discovered that in MDA5 sera, 
versus SRP sera, there was an elevated antibody response to the viral capsid 
protein 1 (VP1) of enterovirus B, which was accompanied by a decreased antibody 
response to rhinovirus A.
CONCLUSION: Considering the role of MDA5 as a sensor of picornaviral infections 
and a mediator of inflammatory signaling, our data suggest a novel etiologic 
link between enterovirus infection and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis.

Viral infections can cause cellular pathway derangements, cell death, and 
immunopathological responses, leading to host inflammation. Short-chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs), produced by the microbiota, have emerged as a potential 
therapeutic for viral infections due to their ability to modulate these 
processes. However, SCFAs have been reported to have both beneficial and 
detrimental effects, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the 
underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the complex mechanisms underlying 
SCFAs' effects on viral infection outcomes. We also emphasize the importance of 
considering how SCFAs' activities may differ under diverse contexts, including 
but not limited to target cells with different metabolic wiring, different viral 
causes of infection, the target organism/cell's nutrient availability and/or 
energy balance, and hosts with varying microbiome compositions.

Pregnancy is a risk factor for increased severity of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory infections, but the 
mechanisms underlying this risk are poorly understood. To gain insight into the 
role of pregnancy in modulating immune responses at baseline and upon SARS-CoV-2 
infection, we collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma from 226 
women, including 152 pregnant individuals and 74 non-pregnant women. We find 
that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with altered T cell responses in 
pregnant women, including a clonal expansion of CD4-expressing CD8+ T cells, 
diminished interferon responses, and profound suppression of monocyte function. 
We also identify shifts in cytokine and chemokine levels in the sera of pregnant 
individuals, including a robust increase of interleukin-27, known to drive 
T cell exhaustion. Our findings reveal nuanced pregnancy-associated immune 
responses, which may contribute to the increased susceptibility of pregnant 
individuals to viral respiratory infection.

The mechanisms by which respiratory viruses predispose to secondary bacterial 
infections remain poorly characterized. Using 2,409 nasopharyngeal swabs from 
300 infants in Botswana, we performed a detailed analysis of factors that 
influence the dynamics of bacterial pathobiont colonization during infancy. We 
quantify the extent to which viruses increase the acquisition of Haemophilus 
influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We provide 
evidence of cooperative interactions between these pathobionts while identifying 
host characteristics and environmental exposures that influence the odds of 
pathobiont colonization during early life. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we 
demonstrate that respiratory viruses result in losses of putatively beneficial 
Corynebacterium and Streptococcus species that are associated with a lower odds 
of pathobiont acquisition. These findings provide novel insights into 
viral-bacterial relationships in the URT of direct relevance to respiratory 
infections and suggest that the URT bacterial microbiota is a potentially 
modifiable mechanism by which viruses promote bacterial respiratory infections.

Lymphocystis viral disease (LVD) is a highly transmissible disease known to 
affect multiple fishes worldwide. Although this disease is usually benign, 
mortalities can occur in cases where infection is severe or secondary infection 
with bacterial pathogens and parasites occur. However, little is known about the 
bacterial dynamics of fish with LVD or what bacterial pathogens may be 
responsible for secondary infections. Here we assessed the effects of LVD on the 
skin microbiome of gilthead seabream by comparing 30 symptomatic, asymptomatic 
and recovered (three weeks after infection) fish using 16S rRNA high-throughput 
sequencing. Our results show that LVD is associated with significant changes in 
microbiome structure and function. Importantly, fish pathogens like 
Tenacibaculum maritimum and some Vibrio species increased their abundance. 
Moreover, microbial metabolic activities of the commensal microbiota that may 
confer some protection to fish were suppressed in diseased fish. After reducing 
fish cage density to treat symptoms and three weeks of recovery, the abundance 
of pathogens was significantly reduced and microbiome functionality was 
recovered, although community structure remained significantly different. These 
results show that LVD can severely disrupt the bacterial communities of the skin 
of the gilthead seabream, leading to an increase in bacterial pathogens 
responsible for relevant diseases in gilthead seabream farms.

Wolbachia pipientis (= Wolbachia) has promise as a tool to suppress virus 
transmission by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. However, Wolbachia can have variable 
effects on mosquito-borne viruses. This variation remains poorly characterized, 
yet the multimodal effects of Wolbachia on diverse pathogens could have 
important implications for public health. Here, we examine the effects of 
transient somatic infection with two strains of Wolbachia (wAlbB and wMel) on 
the alphaviruses Sindbis virus (SINV), O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), and Mayaro 
virus (MAYV) in Ae. aegypti. We found variable effects of Wolbachia including 
enhancement and suppression of viral infections, with some effects depending on 
Wolbachia strain. Both wAlbB- and wMel-infected mosquitoes showed enhancement of 
SINV infection rates one week post-infection, with wAlbB-infected mosquitoes 
also having higher viral titers than controls. Infection rates with ONNV were 
low across all treatments and no significant effects of Wolbachia were observed. 
The effects of Wolbachia on MAYV infections were strikingly strain-specific; 
wMel strongly blocked MAYV infections and suppressed viral titers, while wAlbB 
had more modest effects. The variable effects of Wolbachia on vector competence 
underscore the importance of further research into how this bacterium impacts 
the virome of wild mosquitoes including the emergent human pathogens they 
transmit.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in DNA sequencing and analysis of the respiratory 
microbiome highlight its close association with bronchiectasis phenotypes, 
revealing fresh opportunities for diagnosis, stratification, and personalized 
clinical intervention. An under-recognized condition, bronchiectasis is 
increasingly the subject of recent large-scale, multicentre, and longitudinal 
clinical studies including detailed analysis of the microbiome. In this review, 
we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the bronchiectasis 
microbiome within the context of its potential use in treatment decisions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Diverse microbiome profiles exist in bronchiectasis, in line 
with the established disease heterogeneity including treatment response. 
Classical microbiology has established Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus 
influenza as two microbial markers of disease, while holistic microbiome 
analysis has uncovered important associations with less common bacterial taxa 
including commensal an/or pathobiont species, including the emerging role of the 
fungal mycobiome, virome, and interactome. Integration of airway microbiomes 
with other high-dimensional biological and clinical datasets holds significant 
promise to determining treatable traits and mechanisms of disease related to the 
microbiome.
SUMMARY: The bronchiectasis microbiome is an emerging and key area of study with 
significant implications for understanding bronchiectasis, influencing treatment 
decisions and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Recovery of virus sequences from old samples provides an opportunity to study 
virus evolution and reconstruct historic virus-host interactions. Studies of old 
virus sequences have mainly relied on DNA or on RNA from fixed or frozen 
samples. The millions of specimens in natural history museums represent a 
potential treasure trove of old virus sequences, but it is not clear how well 
RNA survives in old samples. We experimentally assessed the stability of RNA in 
insects stored dry at room temperature over 72 weeks. Although RNA molecules 
grew fragmented, RNA yields remained surprisingly constant. RT-qPCR of host and 
virus RNA showed minimal differences between dried and frozen specimens. To 
assess RNA survival in much older samples we acquired Drosophila specimens from 
North American entomological collections. We recovered sequences from known and 
novel viruses including several coding complete virus genomes from a fly 
collected in 1908. We found that the virome of D. melanogaster has changed 
little over the past century. Galbut virus, the most prevalent virus infection 
in contemporary D. melanogaster, was also the most common in historic samples. 
Finally, we investigated the genomic and physical features of surviving RNA. RNA 
that survived was fragmented, chemically damaged, and preferentially double 
stranded or contained in ribonucleoprotein complexes. This showed that RNA - 
especially certain types of RNA - can survive in biological specimens over 
extended periods in the absence of fixation or freezing and confirms the utility 
of dried specimens to provide a clearer understanding of virus evolution.

Mimicry of host protein structures, or 'molecular mimicry', is a common 
mechanism employed by viruses to evade the host's immune system. Short linear 
amino acid (AA) molecular mimics can elicit cross-reactive antibodies and T 
cells from the host, but the prevalence of such mimics throughout the human 
virome has not been fully explored. Here we evaluate 134 human-infecting viruses 
and find significant usage of linear mimicry across the virome, particularly 
those in the Herpesviridae and Poxviridae families. Furthermore, host proteins 
related to cellular replication and inflammation, autosomes, the X chromosome, 
and thymic cells are enriched as viral mimicry targets. Finally, we find that 
short linear mimicry from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is higher in auto-antibodies 
found in patients with multiple sclerosis than previously appreciated. Our 
results thus hint that human-infecting viruses leverage mimicry in the course of 
their infection, and that such mimicry may contribute to autoimmunity, thereby 
prompting potential targets for therapies.

BACKGROUND: Extensive research on the diversity and functional roles of the 
microorganisms associated with reef-building corals has been promoted as a 
consequence of the rapid global decline of coral reefs attributed to climate 
change. Several studies have highlighted the importance of coral-associated 
algae (Symbiodinium) and bacteria and their potential roles in promoting coral 
host fitness and survival. However, the complex coral holobiont extends beyond 
these components to encompass other entities such as protists, fungi, and 
viruses. While each constituent has been individually investigated in corals, a 
comprehensive understanding of their collective roles is imperative for a 
holistic comprehension of coral health and resilience.
RESULTS: The metagenomic analysis of the microbiome of the coral Oculina 
patagonica has revealed that fungi of the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, and 
Rhizofagus together with the prokaryotic genera Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and 
Bacillus were abundant members of the coral holobiont. This study also assessed 
changes in microeukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral communities under three 
stress conditions: aquaria confinement, heat stress, and Vibrio infections. In 
general, stress conditions led to an increase in Rhodobacteraceae, 
Flavobacteraceae, and Vibrionaceae families, accompanied by a decrease in 
Streptomycetaceae. Concurrently, there was a significant decline in both the 
abundance and richness of microeukaryotic species and a reduction in genes 
associated with antimicrobial compound production by the coral itself, as well 
as by Symbiodinium and fungi.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the interplay between microeukaryotic and 
prokaryotic components of the coral holobiont may be disrupted by stress 
conditions, such as confinement, increase of seawater temperature, or Vibrio 
infection, leading to a dysbiosis in the global microbial community that may 
increase coral susceptibility to diseases. Further, microeukaryotic community 
seems to exert influence on the prokaryotic community dynamics, possibly through 
predation or the production of secondary metabolites with anti-bacterial 
activity. Video Abstract.

Secondary bacterial pneumonia (2°BP) is associated with significant morbidity 
following respiratory viral infection, yet remains incompletely understood. In a 
prospective cohort of 112 critically ill adults intubated for COVID-19, we 
comparatively assess longitudinal airway microbiome dynamics and the pulmonary 
transcriptome of patients who developed 2°BP versus controls who did not. We 
find that 2°BP is significantly associated with both mortality and 
corticosteroid treatment. The pulmonary microbiome in 2°BP is characterized by 
increased bacterial RNA mass and dominance of culture-confirmed pathogens, 
detectable days prior to 2°BP clinical diagnosis, and frequently also present in 
nasal swabs. Assessment of the pulmonary transcriptome reveals suppressed TNFα 
signaling in patients with 2°BP, and sensitivity analyses suggest this finding 
is mediated by corticosteroid treatment. Further, we find that increased 
bacterial RNA mass correlates with reduced expression of innate and adaptive 
immunity genes in both 2°BP patients and controls. Taken together, our findings 
provide fresh insights into the microbial dynamics and host immune features of 
COVID-19-associated 2°BP, and suggest that suppressed immune signaling, 
potentially mediated by corticosteroid treatment, permits expansion of 
opportunistic bacterial pathogens.

Surfactin, a lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus spp., has emerged as 
a promising bioactive compound due to its potent inhibitory effects on bacterial 
and viral pathogens. This showcases its potential as a non-antibiotic strategy 
for managing infectious diseases. Our investigation reveals that surfactin 
administration significantly promotes weight gain and improves immune organ 
indices in mice, reflecting enhanced immunity and gut health. Surfactin augments 
phagocytic function in peritoneal macrophages and boosts proliferative responses 
in splenic lymphocytes post-chicken red blood cell immunization. Furthermore, it 
increases intestinal villi height, indicative of superior nutrient absorption. 
It elevates mucin secretion and expression of intestinal mucosal proteins, such 
as secretory IgA, Muc1, and Muc2, and tight junction proteins claudin-1, 
occludin, and Zo-1 in the jejunum and colon. Crucially, surfactin modifies the 
gut microbiota composition by reducing Escherichia coli populations and 
ameliorating cyclophosphamide-induced gut dysbiosis. Our data suggest that oral 
surfactin could be a valuable therapeutic modality to alleviate immune 
suppression and gut damage, proposing a new pathway for immunomodulatory 
treatment.
IMPORTANCE: The potential of surfactin as a microbial surfactant extends beyond 
its surfactant properties, impacting immune regulation and gut health. As the 
need for alternatives to traditional antibiotics continues to grow, surfactin's 
ability to enhance host defense mechanisms against common pathogens without 
directly targeting them with antibiotics offers a strategic advantage. 
Understanding how surfactin shapes the immune landscape and the gut microbiome 
can inform innovative interventions against immunosuppression and intestinal 
impairment, particularly in contexts such as cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity.

Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations influence brain 
function and could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The 
potential of using fecal microbiota signatures to aid autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) detection is still not fully explored. Here, we assessed the potential of 
different levels of microbial markers (taxonomy and genome) in distinguishing 
children with ASD from age and gender-matched typically developing peers 
(n = 598, ASD vs TD = 273 vs 325). A combined microbial taxa and 
metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) markers showed a better performance than 
either microbial taxa or microbial MAGs alone for detecting ASD. A 
machine-learning model comprising 5 bacterial taxa and 44 microbial MAG markers 
(2 viral MAGs and 42 bacterial MAGs) achieved an area under the receiving 
operator curve (AUROC) of 0.886 in the discovery cohort and 0.734 in an 
independent validation cohort. Furthermore, the identified biomarkers and 
predicted ASD risk score also significantly correlated with the core symptoms 
measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). The microbiome panel 
showed a superior classification performance in younger children (≤6 years old) 
with an AUROC of 0.845 than older children (>6 years). The model was broadly 
applicable to subjects across genders, with or without gastrointestinal tract 
symptoms (constipation and diarrhea) and with or without psychiatric 
comorbidities (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and anxiety). This 
study highlights the potential clinical validity of fecal microbiome to aid in 
ASD diagnosis and will facilitate studies to understand the association of 
disturbance of human gut microbiota and ASD symptom severity.

INTRODUCTION: The maintenance of intestinal homeostasis depends on a complex 
interaction between the immune system, intestinal epithelial barrier, and 
microbiota. Alteration in one of these components could lead to the development 
of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Variants within the autophagy gene ATG16L1 
have been implicated in susceptibility and severity of Crohn's disease (CD). 
Individuals carrying the risk ATG16L1 T300A variant have higher caspase 
3-dependent degradation of ATG16L1 resulting in impaired autophagy and increased 
cellular stress. ATG16L1-deficiency induces enhanced IL-1β secretion in 
dendritic cells in response to bacterial infection. Infection of 
ATG16L1-deficient mice with a persistent strain of murine norovirus renders 
these mice highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium colitis. Moreover, 
persistent norovirus infection leads to intestinal virus specific CD8+ T cells 
responses. Both Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which recognizes single-stranded 
RNA viruses, and ATG16L1, which facilitates the delivery of viral nucleic acids 
to the autolysosome endosome, are required for anti-viral immune responses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: However, the role of the enteric virome in IBD is still 
poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of TLR7 and ATG16L1 in 
intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. At steady state, Tlr7-/- mice have a 
significant increase in large intestinal lamina propria (LP) granzyme B+ 
tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells compared to WT mice, reminiscent of 
persistent norovirus infection. Deletion of Atg16l1 in myeloid (Atg16l1ΔLyz2 ) 
or dendritic cells (Atg16l1ΔCd11c ) leads to a similar increase of LP TRM. 
Furthermore, Tlr7-/- and Atg16l1ΔCd11c mice were more susceptible to dextran 
sulfate sodium colitis with an increase in disease activity index, histoscore, 
and increased secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Treatment of Atg16l1ΔCd11c mice with 
the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod attenuated colonic inflammation in these mice. Our 
data demonstrate that ATG16L1-deficiency in myeloid and dendritic cells leads to 
an increase in LP TRM and consequently to increased susceptibility to colitis by 
impairing the recognition of enteric viruses by TLR7.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the convergence of ATG16L1 and TLR7 signaling 
pathways plays an important role in the immune response to intestinal viruses. 
Our data suggest that activation of the TLR7 signaling pathway could be an 
attractive therapeutic target for CD patients with ATG16L1 risk variants.

Botrytis species cause gray mold disease in more than 200 crops worldwide. To 
control this disease, chemical fungicides are usually applied. However, more 
sustainable control alternatives should be explored, such as the use of 
hypovirulent mycovirus-infected fungal strains. To determine the mycovirome of 
two Botrytis species, B. cinerea and B. prunorum, we reanalyzed RNA-Seq and 
small RNA-Seq data using different assembly programs and an updated viral 
database, aiming to identify new mycoviruses that were previously not described 
in the same dataset. New mycoviruses were identified, including those previously 
reported to infect or be associated with B. cinerea and Plasmopara viticola, 
such as Botrytis cinerea alpha-like virus 1 and Plasmopara viticola 
lesion-associated ourmia-like virus 80. Additionally, two novel narnaviruses, 
not previously identified infecting Botrytis species, have been characterized, 
tentatively named Botrytis cinerea narnavirus 1 and Botrytis narnavirus 1. The 
analysis of small RNAs suggested that all identified mycoviruses were targeted 
by the antiviral fungal mechanism, regardless of the viral genome type. In 
conclusion, the enlarged list of newly found viruses and the application of 
different bioinformatics approaches have enabled the identification of novel 
mycoviruses not previously described in Botrytis species, expanding the already 
extensive list.

Commercially cultivated Prunus species are commonly grown in adjacent or mixed 
orchards and can be infected with unique or commonly shared viruses. Apple 
(Malus domestica), another member of the Rosacea and distantly related to 
Prunus, can share the same growing regions and common pathogens. Pollen can be a 
major route for virus transmission, and analysis of the pollen virome in tree 
fruit orchards can provide insights into these virus pathogen complexes from 
mixed production sites. Commercial honey bee (Apis mellifera) pollination is 
essential for improved fruit sets and yields in tree fruit production systems. 
To better understand the pollen-associated virome in tree fruits, 
metagenomics-based detection of plant viruses was employed on bee and pollen 
samples collected at four time points during the peak bloom period of apricot, 
cherry, peach, and apple trees at one orchard site. Twenty-one unique viruses 
were detected in samples collected during tree fruit blooms, including prune 
dwarf virus (PDV) and prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) (Genus Ilarvirus, 
family Bromoviridae), Secoviridae family members tomato ringspot virus (genus 
Nepovirus), tobacco ringspot virus (genus Nepovirus), prunus virus F (genus 
Fabavirus), and Betaflexiviridae family member cherry virus A (CVA; genus 
Capillovirus). Viruses were also identified in composite leaf and flower samples 
to compare the pollen virome with the virome associated with vegetative tissues. 
At all four time points, a greater diversity of viruses was detected in the bee 
and pollen samples. Finally, the nucleotide sequence diversity of the coat 
protein regions of CVA, PDV, and PNRSV was profiled from this site, 
demonstrating a wide range of sequence diversity in pollen samples from this 
site. These results demonstrate the benefits of area-wide monitoring through bee 
pollination activities and provide new insights into the diversity of viruses in 
tree fruit pollination ecosystems.

The maize leafhopper (Dalbulus maidis) is a significant threat to maize crops in 
tropical and subtropical regions, causing extensive economic losses. While its 
ecological interactions and control strategies are well studied, its associated 
viral diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ high-throughput 
sequencing data mining to comprehensively characterize the D. maidis RNA virome, 
revealing novel and diverse RNA viruses. We characterized six new viral members 
belonging to distinct families, with evolutionary cues of beny-like viruses 
(Benyviridae), bunya-like viruses (Bunyaviridae) iflaviruses (Iflaviridae), 
orthomyxo-like viruses (Orthomyxoviridae), and rhabdoviruses (Rhabdoviridae). 
Phylogenetic analysis of the iflaviruses places them within the genus Iflavirus 
in affinity with other leafhopper-associated iflaviruses. The five-segmented and 
highly divergent orthomyxo-like virus showed a relationship with other insect 
associated orthomyxo-like viruses. The rhabdo virus is related to a 
leafhopper-associated rhabdo-like virus. Furthermore, the beny-like virus 
belonged to a cluster of insect-associated beny-like viruses, while the 
bi-segmented bunya-like virus was related with other bi-segmented 
insect-associated bunya-like viruses. These results highlight the existence of a 
complex virome linked to D. maidis and paves the way for future studies 
investigating the ecological roles, evolutionary dynamics, and potential 
biocontrol applications of these viruses on the D. maidis-maize pathosystem.

Individuals with pancreatic-related health conditions usually show lower 
diversity and different composition of bacterial and viral species between the 
gut and oral microbiomes compared to healthy individuals. We performed a 
thorough microbiome analysis, using deep shotgun sequencing of stool and saliva 
samples obtained from patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and healthy controls (HCs).We observed similar microbiota 
composition at the species level in both the gut and oral samples in PDAC 
patients compared to HCs, among which the most distinctive finding was that the 
abundance of oral-originated Fusobacterium nucleatum species did not differ 
between the oral and the gut samples. Moreover, comparing PDAC patients with 
HCs, Klebsiella oxytoca was significantly more abundant in the stool samples of 
PDAC patients, while Streptococcus spp. showed higher abundance in both the oral 
and stool samples of PDAC patients. Finally, the most important finding was the 
distinctive gut phage-bacterial interactome pattern among PDAC patients. 
CrAssphages, particularly Blohavirus, showed mutual exclusion with K. oxytoca 
species, while Burzaovirus showed co-occurrence with Enterobacteriaceae spp., 
which have been shown to be capable of inducing DNA damage in human pancreatic 
cells ex vivo. The interactome findings warrant further mechanistic studies, as 
our findings may provide new insights into developing microbiota-based 
diagnostic and therapeutic methods for pancreatic diseases.

Gastrointestinal pathophysiology in long COVID: Exploring roles of microbiota 
dysbiosis and serotonin dysregulation in post-infectious bowel symptoms.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
triggered an unprecedented public health crisis known as the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms develop in patients 
during acute infection and persist after recovery from airway distress in a 
chronic form of the disease (long COVID). A high incidence of irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) manifested by severe abdominal pain and defecation pattern 
changes is reported in COVID patients. Although COVID is primarily considered a 
respiratory disease, fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 antigens positively correlates 
with bowel symptoms. Active viral infection in the GI tract was identified by 
human intestinal organoid studies showing SARS-CoV-2 replication in gut 
epithelial cells. In this review, we highlight the key findings in post-COVID 
bowel symptoms and explore possible mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of 
the illness. These mechanisms include mucosal inflammation, gut barrier 
dysfunction, and microbiota dysbiosis during viral infection. Viral shedding 
through the GI route may be the primary factor causing the alteration of the 
microbiome ecosystem, particularly the virome. Recent evidence in experimental 
models suggested that microbiome dysbiosis could be further aggravated by 
epithelial barrier damage and immune activation. Moreover, altered microbiota 
composition has been associated with dysregulated serotonin pathways, resulting 
in intestinal nerve hypersensitivity. These mechanisms may explain the 
development of post-infectious IBS-like symptoms in long COVID. Understanding 
how coronavirus infection affects gut pathophysiology, including microbiome 
changes, would benefit the therapeutic advancement for managing post-infectious 
bowel symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Elevated blood eosinophil levels in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with or without asthma are linked to 
increased exacerbations and the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid 
treatment. This study aimed to delineate the inflammatory cellular properties of 
eosinophils in patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) and eosinophilic COPD 
(eCOPD).
METHODS: Eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy 
volunteers, patients with non-eCOPD, and those with ACO/eCOPD. Multi-omics 
analysis involving transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics was performed, 
followed by bioinformatic data analyses. In vitro experiments using eosinophils 
from healthy volunteers were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms 
underlying cellular alterations in eosinophils.
RESULTS: Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed cellular 
characteristics in overall COPD patients represented by viral infection 
(elevated expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1) and 
inflammatory responses (elevated levels of IL1 receptor-like 1, Fc epsilon 
receptor Ig, and transmembrane protein 176B). Cholesterol metabolism enzymes 
were identified as ACO/eCOPD-related factors. Gene Ontology and pathway 
enrichment analyses demonstrated the key roles of antiviral responses, 
cholesterol metabolism, and inflammatory molecules-related signaling pathways in 
ACO/eCOPD. Lipidomics showed the impaired synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived 
mediators including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in ACO/eCOPD. In vitro assessment 
confirmed that IL-33 or TNF-α stimulation combined with IL-5 and IFN-γ 
stimulation induced cellular signatures in eosinophils in ACO/eCOPD. 
Atorvastatin, dexamethasone, and PGE2 differentially modulated these 
inflammatory changes.
DISCUSSION: ACO/eCOPD is associated with viral infection and an inflammatory 
milieu. Therapeutic strategies using statins and inhaled corticosteroids are 
recommended to control these pathogenic changes.

The viral intra-host genetic diversities and interactions with the human genome 
during decades of persistence remain poorly characterized. In this study, we 
analyzed the variability and integration sites of persisting viruses in nine 
organs from thirteen individuals who died suddenly from non-viral causes. The 
viruses studied included parvovirus B19, six herpesviruses, Merkel cell (MCPyV) 
and JC polyomaviruses, totaling 127 genomes. The viral sequences across organs 
were remarkably conserved within each individual, suggesting that persistence 
stems from single dominant strains. This indicates that intra-host viral 
evolution, thus far inferred primarily from immunocompromised patients, is 
likely overestimated in healthy subjects. Indeed, we detected increased viral 
subpopulations in two individuals with putative reactivations, suggesting that 
replication status influences diversity. Furthermore, we identified asymmetrical 
mutation patterns reflecting selective pressures exerted by the host. 
Strikingly, our analysis revealed non-clonal viral integrations even in 
individuals without cancer. These included MCPyV integrations and truncations 
resembling clonally expanded variants in Merkel cell carcinomas, as well as 
novel junctions between herpesvirus 6B and mitochondrial sequences, the 
significance of which remains to be evaluated. Our work systematically 
characterizes the genomic landscape of the tissue-resident virome, highlighting 
potential deviations occurring during disease.

INTRODUCTION: Although wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) successfully 
functioned as a tool for monitoring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic globally, relatively little is known about its utility in low-income 
countries. This study aimed to quantify severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater, estimate the number of infected 
individuals in the catchment areas, and correlate the results with the 
clinically reported COVID-19 cases in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A total of 323 influent and 33 effluent wastewater samples were 
collected from three Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) using a 24-h composite 
Moore swab sampling method from February to November 2023. The virus was 
captured using Ceres Nanotrap® Enhancement Reagent 2 and Nanotrap® Microbiome A 
Particles, and then nucleic acids were extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral 
RNA Mini Kit. The ThermoFisher TaqPath™ COVID-19 kit was applied to perform 
real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to quantify 
the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Wastewater viral concentrations were normalized using flow 
rate and number of people served. In the sampling period, spearman correlation 
was used to compare the SARS-CoV-2 target gene concentration to the reported 
COVID-19 cases. The numbers of infected individuals under each treatment plant 
were calculated considering the target genes' concentration, the flow rate of 
treatment plants, a gram of feces per person-day, and RNA copies per gram of 
feces.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 94% of untreated wastewater samples. All 
effluent wastewater samples (n = 22) from the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket 
(UASB) reactor and membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology were SARS-COV-2 RNA 
negative. In contrast, two out of 11 effluents from Waste Stabilization Pond 
were found positive. Positive correlations were observed between the weekly 
average SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the cumulative weekly reported COVID-19 
cases in Addis Ababa. The estimated number of infected people in the Kality 
Treatment catchment area was 330 times the number of COVID-19 cases reported 
during the study period in Addis Ababa.
DISCUSSION: This study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the community 
and confirmed previous reports of more asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia. 
Additionally, this study provides further evidence of the importance of 
wastewater-based surveillance in general to monitor infectious diseases in 
low-income settings.
CONCLUSION: Wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be a useful method 
for tracking the increment of COVID-19 cases before it spreads widely throughout 
the community.

Torque teno virus (TTV) viral load (VL), a component of the human virome, 
increases during immune suppression or dysregulation. This study aimed to 
explore TTV VL in youths living with vertically acquired HIV (YWVH) and its 
potential as an immunovirological marker. We performed an observational, 
retrospective study involving YWVH under antiretroviral treatment (ART) from the 
Spanish Cohort of HIV-infected children, adolescents, and vertically 
HIV-infected patients transferred to Adult Units (CoRISpe-FARO), compared to 
HIV-negative healthy donors (HD). Plasma TTV VL was assessed by qPCR. T-cell 
phenotype was analysed on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 
flow cytometry. Correlations with baseline CD4 and CD8 and long-term virological 
evolution were examined. A total of 57 YWVH were compared with 23 HD. YWVH had a 
median CD4 T-cells of 736 cells/mm3 [IQR: 574-906], a median of 17 years [IQR: 
14-20.5] since ART initiation, and 65 months [IQR: 39-116] under HIV-RNA 
virological control. TTV VL was higher among YWVH and in males compared with 
females (p < 0.05). Among YWVH, TTV VL correlated with CD4 and CD8 counts and 
the CD4/CD8 ratio (p = 0.002; r = - 0.39, p = 0.037; r = 0.277, p = 0.005; 
r = - 0.37 respectively). TTV VL correlated with activation expression markers 
(HLA-DR+/CD38+) on CD4 (p = 0.007, r = 0.39) and the soluble proinflammatory 
cytokine IL-6 (p = 0.006, r = 0.38).

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota play important roles in several diseases like viral 
infections. In this systematic review, our objective was to assess the efficacy 
and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating various viral 
diseases.
METHODS: We conducted searches on databases including PubMed, Web of Science, 
Scopus, and Google Scholar until November 2023. Clinical trials reported 
outcomes related to safety of FMT or its efficacy in patients with viral 
diseases were included. We excluded other types of studies that enrolled healthy 
individuals or patients with other disorders and did not use FMT. The assessment 
of bias risk was conducted using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study 
quality evaluation tool.
RESULTS: Eight studies with total 196 participants were included. Viral diseases 
were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, COVID-19 and 
Clostridioides difficile coinfection, and cytomegalovirus colitis. In hepatitis 
B cases, HBeAg clearance was significant in those received FMT (p<0.01), while 
it was not significant in another one (p = 0.19). A clinical response was noted 
in 37.5% of patients with cytomegalovirus colitis, with an equal percentage 
achieving clinical remission post-FMT. There was a significant reduction in 
Clostridioides difficile relapse rate in FMT group than controls in coinfection 
of Clostridioides difficile and COVID-19 (2.17% vs. 42.5%, p<0.05). In patients 
with HIV, partial engraftment of the donor microbiome and increases in alpha 
diversity were observed after FMT. No severe adverse events were reported. Most 
studies had fair or good qualities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed FMT as a promising, safe treatment for some 
viral diseases. It improved viral clearance, clinical outcomes, and 
inflammation. However, the varying responses and small sample sizes call for 
more trials on FMT in viral diseases.

Oral microecological imbalance is closely linked to oral mucosal inflammation 
and is implicated in the development of both local and systemic diseases, 
including those caused by viral infections. This review examines the critical 
role of the interleukin (IL)-17/helper T cell 17 (Th17) axis in regulating 
immune responses within the oral mucosa, focusing on both its protective and 
pathogenic roles during inflammation. We specifically highlight how the 
IL-17/Th17 pathway contributes to dysregulated inflammation in the context of 
respiratory viral infections. Furthermore, this review explores the potential 
interactions between respiratory viruses and the oral microbiota, emphasizing 
how alterations in the oral microbiome and increased production of 
proinflammatory factors may serve as early, non-invasive biomarkers for 
predicting the severity of respiratory viral infections. These findings provide 
insights into novel diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies aimed at 
mitigating respiratory disease severity through monitoring and modulating the 
oral microbiome.

INTRODUCTION: Following the Omicron wave in early 2022, an estimated 60-70% of 
the French population was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One out of ten 
infected subjects could have persistent symptoms three months after infection, 
representing a public health challenge.
CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: The persistent symptoms may be secondary to diverse 
entities with distinct mechanisms. While organic infection sequelae occur mainly 
after severe COVID-19, some symptoms appear to be essentially psychological in 
origin; in addition, many subjects present stereotyped symptoms of fluctuating 
intensity with no identified anatomical or psychic substratum, often in the 
aftermath of a benign infection. The most frequent complaints are fatigue, pain, 
dyspnea and difficulty concentrating.
PERSPECTIVES: The hypotheses explored to explain these symptoms include: 
persistent immune dysfunction, inducted autoimmunity, and microbiome 
disturbances. Persistent viral antigens may lie at the crossroads of these 
mechanisms. To date, these different etiological avenues have yet to lead to the 
development of diagnostic tests or specific therapeutic strategies.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged symptoms after COVID-19 correspond to heterogeneous 
nosological entities with poorly understood mechanisms.

Despite the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in reducing the global 
incidence of vertical HIV transmissions, more than 120,000 children are still 
infected with the virus each year. Since ART cannot clear the HIV reservoir that 
is established soon after infection, children living with HIV (CLWH) are forced 
to rely on therapy for their lives and suffer from long-term drug-related 
complications. Pediatric HIV infection, like adult infection, is associated with 
gut microbial dysbiosis, loss of gut epithelial integrity, bacterial 
translocation, CD4 + T cell depletion, systemic immune activation, and viral 
reservoir establishment. However, unlike in adults, HIV that is vertically 
acquired by infants interacts with a gut microbiome that is continuously 
evolving while concomitantly shaping the infant's immune ontogeny. Therefore, to 
determine whether there may be interventions that target the HIV reservoir 
through microbiome-directed approaches, understanding the complex tripartite 
interactions between the transmitted HIV, the maturing gut microbiome, and the 
developing immune system during early life is crucial. Importantly, early life 
is the time when the gut microbiome of an individual is highly dynamic, and this 
temporal development of the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in educating the 
maturing immune system of a child. Therefore, manipulation of the gut microbiome 
of CLWH to a phenotype that can reduce HIV persistence by fostering an antiviral 
immune system might be an opportune strategy to achieve ART-free viral 
suppression in CLWH. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on 
the vertical transmission of HIV, the developing gut microbiome of CLWH, and the 
immune landscape of pediatric elite controllers, and explores the prospect of 
employing microbial modulation as a potential therapeutic approach to achieve 
ART-free viral suppression in the pediatric population.

BACKGROUND: Birds are known to harbour many pathogens, including circovirus, 
herpesviruses, adenoviruses and Chlamydia psittaci. Some of these pose zoonotic 
risks, while others, such as beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), have a 
significant impact on the conservation of endangered bird species.
OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to determine the faecal virome of a group of 
apparently healthy Monk parakeet using high-throughput sequencing.
METHODS: Fresh faecal samples were collected from four Monk parakeets at a pet 
shop in Melbourne, Australia. Virus enrichment and nucleic acid extraction were 
performed on the faecal samples, followed by high-throughput sequencing at the 
Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).
RESULTS: Utilising an established pipeline for high-throughput sequencing data 
analysis, this study revealed the presence of three viruses of the families 
Circoviridae, Parvoviridae and Adenoviridae. Subsequent sequence comparison and 
phylogenetic analyses further confirmed that the detected viruses belong to the 
genera Chaphamaparvovirus (unassigned species), Circovirus (species Circovirus 
parrot) and Siadenovirus (species Siadenovirus viridis).
CONCLUSION: Despite non-pathogenicity, the existence of multiple viruses within 
a bird species underscores the risk of these viruses spreading into the pet 
trade. Detection and a better understanding of avian viruses are crucial for the 
establishment of appropriate management and biosecurity measures in the domestic 
and international bird trade, which ultimately supports the conservation of 
vulnerable bird species.

BACKGROUND: HIV-1 infection is characterized by a massive depletion of mucosal 
CD4 T cells that triggers a cascade of events ultimately linking gut microbial 
dysbiosis to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis. The association between 
HIV infection and the enteric virome composition is less characterized, although 
viruses are an essential component of the gut ecosystem. Here, we performed a 
cross-sectional analysis of the fecal viral (eukaryotic viruses and 
bacteriophages) and bacterial microbiome in people with HIV (PWH) and in 
HIV-negative individuals. To gain further insight into the association between 
the gut microbiome composition, HIV-associated immunodeficiency, and immune 
recovery, we carried out a longitudinal study including 14 PWH who initiated 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were followed for 24 months with samplings 
performed at baseline (before ART) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-ART 
initiation.
RESULTS: Our data revealed a striking expansion in the abundance and prevalence 
of several human virus genomic sequences (Anelloviridae, Adenoviridae, and 
Papillomaviridae) in stool samples of PWH with severe immunodeficiency 
(CD4 < 200). We also noted a decreased abundance of sequences belonging to two 
plant viruses from the Tobamovirus genus, a reduction in bacterial alpha 
diversity, and a decrease in Inoviridae bacteriophage sequences. Short-term ART 
(24 months) was linked to a significant decrease in human Anelloviridae 
sequences. Remarkably, the detection of Anellovirus sequences at baseline 
independently predicted poor immune recovery, as did low CD4 T cell counts. The 
bacterial and bacteriophage populations were unique to each PWH with 
individualized trajectories; we found no discernable pattern of clustering after 
24 months on ART.
CONCLUSION: Advanced HIV-1 infection was associated with marked alterations in 
the virome composition, in particular a remarkable expansion of human 
anelloviruses, with a gradual restoration after ART initiation. In addition to 
CD4 T cell counts, anellovirus sequence detection might be useful to predict and 
monitor immune recovery. This study confirms data on the bacteriome and expands 
our knowledge on the viral component of the gut microbiome in HIV-1 infection.

Bacteriophages are influential within the human gut microbiota, yet they remain 
understudied relative to bacteria. This is a limitation of studies on fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) where bacteriophages likely influence outcome. 
Here, using metagenomics, we profile phage populations - the phageome - in 
individuals recruited into two double-blind randomized trials of FMT in 
ulcerative colitis. We leverage the trial designs to observe that phage 
populations behave similarly to bacterial populations, showing temporal 
stability in health, dysbiosis in active disease, modulation by antibiotic 
treatment and by FMT. We identify a donor bacteriophage putatively associated 
with disease remission, which on genomic analysis was found integrated in a 
bacterium classified to Oscillospiraceae, previously isolated from a centenarian 
and predicted to produce vitamin B complex except B12. Our study provides an 
in-depth assessment of phage populations during different states and suggests 
that bacteriophage tracking has utility in identifying determinants of disease 
activity and resolution.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are critical 
for plant development as well as for its stress response. They can function as 
signaling molecules to orchestrate a well-defined response of plants to biotic 
stress. These responses are further fine-tuned by phytohormones, such as 
salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene, to modulate immune response. In the 
past decades, the intricacies of redox and phytohormonal signaling have been 
uncovered during plant-pathogen interactions. This review explores the dynamic 
interplay of these components, elucidating their roles in perceiving biotic 
threats and shaping the plant's defense strategy. Molecular regulators and sites 
of oxidative burst have been explored during pathogen perception. Further, the 
interplay between various components of redox and phytohormonal signaling has 
been explored during bacterial, fungal, viral, and nematode infections as well 
as during insect pest infestation. Understanding these interactions highlights 
gaps in the current knowledge and provides insights into engineering crop 
varieties with enhanced resistance to pathogens and pests. This review also 
highlights potential applications of manipulating regulators of redox signaling 
to bolster plant immunity and ensure global food security. Future research 
should explore regulators of these signaling pathways as potential target to 
develop biotic stress-tolerant crops. Further insights are also needed into 
roles of endophytes and host microbiome modulating host ROS and RNS pool for 
exploiting them as biocontrol agents imparting resistance against pathogens in 
plants.

BACKGROUND: The rhizosphere microbiome is critical for promoting plant growth 
and mitigating soil-borne pathogens. However, its role in fighting soil-borne 
virus-induced diseases, such as wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) transmitted by 
Polymyxa graminis zoospores, remains largely underexplored. In this study, we 
hypothesized that during viral infections, plant microbiomes engage in critical 
interactions with plants, with key microbes playing vital roles in maintaining 
plant health. Our research aimed to identify microbial taxa that not only 
suppress the disease but also boost wheat yield by using a blend of techniques, 
including field surveys, yield assessments, high-throughput sequencing of plant 
and soil microbiomes, microbial isolation, hydroponic experiments, and 
transcriptome sequencing.
RESULTS: We found that, compared with roots and leaves, the rhizosphere 
microbiome showed a better performance in predicting wheat yield and the 
prevalence of P. graminis and WYMV across the three WYMV-impacted regions in 
China. Using machine learning, we found that healthy rhizospheres were marked 
with potentially beneficial microorganisms, such as Sphingomonas and 
Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Parararhizobium-Rhizobium, whereas diseased 
rhizospheres were associated with a higher prevalence of potential pathogens, 
such as Bipolaris and Fusicolla. Structural equation modeling showed that these 
biomarkers both directly and indirectly impacted wheat yield by modulating the 
rhizosphere microbiome and P. graminis abundance. Upon re-introduction of two 
key healthy rhizosphere biomarkers, Sphingomonas azotifigens and Rhizobium 
deserti, into the rhizosphere, wheat growth and health were enhanced. This was 
attributed to the up-regulation of auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways and 
the regulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways during infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study revealed the critical role of the rhizosphere 
microbiome in combating soil-borne viral diseases, with specific rhizosphere 
microbes playing key roles in this process. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: The events during acute HIV infection (AHI) set the stage for the 
subsequent course of the disease. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) has been associated with favorable immunovirological outcomes, yet the 
precise impact of ART timing during AHI remains unclear, particularly on 
lymphoid tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ACS cohort is a prospective cohort study in Belgium, 
collecting longitudinal clinical data and human bodily material (HBM) from 
people diagnosed and treated during AHI. The aim of the cohort is to study the 
impact of ART initiation during AHI on HIV reservoir and immune dysfunction in 
peripheral blood and anatomical sanctuary sites, as well as its effect on the 
gut microbiome. The cohort consists of two HBM sampling trajectories: one 
limited (blood, stool and leukapheresis) and a more extensive one (blood, stool, 
leukapheresis, colonoscopy, inguinal lymph node excision and lumbar puncture). 
Here we describe the baseline characteristics, immunovirological outcomes, 
safety and tolerability of HBM sampling.
RESULTS: Between March 2016 and April 2024, 47 participants were enrolled, 
predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM), with a median age of 36 years 
[IQR 30-43.5]. Almost 90 % of participants initiated ART within 72 h after study 
inclusion, irrespective of HBM sampling trajectory. The timing of ART initiation 
according to the Fiebig stage did not significantly impact immune recovery 
(CD4/CD8 ratio ≥1) or the time to viral suppression. Approximately 40 % of 
participants opted for the extensive HBM sampling trajectory during AHI. 
However, the participation rate for the extensive trajectory decreased by nearly 
half at the longitudinal follow-up timepoint. In general, study-related 
procedures were safe and well-tolerated, with limited procedure-related adverse 
events (AEs). Inguinal lymph node excision was associated with the highest AE 
rate, in line with previous reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reaffirm the beneficial effect of ART initiation 
during AHI on long term immunovirological outcomes, regardless of Fiebig stage 
at treatment initiation. Additionally, we demonstrate that the collection of HBM 
during and longitudinally after AHI is safe and feasible, without compromising 
time to ART initiation. Cohorts that integrate comprehensive clinical data with 
high-quality HBM samples are essential to longitudinally study the impact of 
early ART on reservoir dynamics and immune responses across various anatomical 
sites after AHI.

Oncolytic viral immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses native or 
genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate and destroy tumor cells. 
In this study, we aimed to construct a virus-based prognostic model for risk 
assessment and prognosis prediction in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) and determine the most appropriate virus as a candidate vector for 
oncolytic virus immunotherapy. Microbiome and RNA sequencing data and clinical 
information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and viruses with 
prognostic value were identified (Deltabaculovirus, Sicinivirus, and 
Cytomegalovirus) to construct the prognostic model. Correlation analyses were 
performed to evaluate the predictive function of the viral signature. 
Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to explore the functional enrichment of 
viral expression in HCC. The risk score generated by this model could 
distinguish patients with different survival outcomes, have excellent 
reliability and accuracy, and could be used as an independent prognostic 
indicator. The high-risk score group showed significantly lower overall 
survival, and this trend was also observed in subgroups with different 
clinicopathological features. Furthermore, Deltabaculovirus positively 
correlated with amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism signaling pathways, 
peroxisomes, and complement coagulation cascades. In addition, Deltabaculovirus 
was significantly related to immune cell infiltration; therefore, patients with 
high Delta-baculovirus expression might respond better to HCC immunotherapy. Our 
study identified a promising predictive viral signature for assessing clinical 
prognosis and guiding immunotherapy in HCC. Deltabaculovirus might be a suitable 
viral vector for oncolytic virus immunotherapy.

Passifloraceae is a plant family that includes several species of interest in 
the food, medicinal, and ornamental industries. The most relevant species are 
the purple and yellow varieties of P. edulis, which are among the most highly 
prized tropical fruits in the international markets. Unfortunately, the rapid 
expansion of this crop worldwide has resulted in the emergence of several viral 
diseases that endangered the productivity of this crop. In this work, we 
performed an integrated analysis of the Passifloraceae virome using public data. 
We investigated Pubmed and Genbank records and analyzed all the transcriptome 
data available for members of this plant family. This analysis resulted in the 
identification of six novel virus associations and six putative new viral 
species. We also used RNAseq to inspect virus accumulation levels and mixed 
infections. Using network analysis, we also examined the global distribution of 
Passiflora viruses and their associations with alternative hosts, which is 
valuable information in implementing viral disease management strategies. Our 
data suggest that a large diversity of viruses remains to be discovered. 
Finally, we used the information gathered in this work to estimate the 
cross-transmission risk of viruses in Colombian Passiflora fields.

Pandemics originating from zoonotic viruses have posed significant threats to 
human health and agriculture. Recent discoveries have revealed that wild-rice 
plants also harbour viral pathogens capable of severely impacting rice 
production, a cornerstone food crop. In this study, we conducted virome analysis 
on ~1000 wild-rice individual colonies and discovered a novel single-strand 
positive-sense RNA virus prevalent in these plants. Through comprehensive 
genomic characterization and comparative sequence analysis, this virus was 
classified as a new species in the genus Polerovirus, designated Rice less 
tiller virus (RLTV). Our investigations elucidated that RLTV could be 
transmitted from wild rice to cultivated rice via a specific insect vector, the 
aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, causing less tiller disease symptoms in rice plants. 
We generated an infectious cDNA clone for RLTV and demonstrated systemic 
infection of rice cultivars and induction of severe disease symptoms following 
mechanical inoculation or stable genetic transformation. We further illustrated 
transmission of RLTV from stable transgenic lines to healthy rice plants by the 
aphid vector, leading to the development of disease symptoms. Notably, our 
database searches showed that RLTV and another polerovirus isolated from a wild 
plant species are widely circulating not only in wild rice but also cultivated 
rice around the world. Our findings provide strong evidence for a wild plant 
origin for rice viruses and underscore the imminent threat posed by 
aphid-transmitted rice Polerovirus to rice cultivar.

Current metagenomic tools can fail to identify highly divergent RNA viruses. We 
developed a deep learning algorithm, termed LucaProt, to discover highly 
divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequences in 10,487 
metatranscriptomes generated from diverse global ecosystems. LucaProt integrates 
both sequence and predicted structural information, enabling the accurate 
detection of RdRP sequences. Using this approach, we identified 161,979 
potential RNA virus species and 180 RNA virus supergroups, including many 
previously poorly studied groups, as well as RNA virus genomes of exceptional 
length (up to 47,250 nucleotides) and genomic complexity. A subset of these 
novel RNA viruses was confirmed by RT-PCR and RNA/DNA sequencing. Newly 
discovered RNA viruses were present in diverse environments, including air, hot 
springs, and hydrothermal vents, with virus diversity and abundance varying 
substantially among ecosystems. This study advances virus discovery, highlights 
the scale of the virosphere, and provides computational tools to better document 
the global RNA virome.

BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease is a rare systemic inflammatory syndrome that 
mainly affects children under five years of age and is the first cause of 
pediatric acquired cardiovascular disease. The pathogenesis is complex and a 
viral trigger is suspected, as well as genetic susceptibility. Multiple studies 
around the world have shown a decrease in the incidence of Kawasaki disease and 
have hypothesized that the different sanitary measures enforced in each country 
during the pandemic period could be responsible to a certain extent. The aim of 
this study is to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the disease's 
incidence, defining characteristics, coronary artery outcomes and management in 
a tertiary center in Switzerland.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of children who have been 
diagnosed with Kawasaki disease that compares clinical, laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 
exposure, and echocardiographic data as well as treatments before (January 1st 
2017 to February 24th 2020) and during (February 25th 2020 to December 31st 
2022) the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. Statistical significance of 
differences in the compared parameters was assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 90 patients included, 31 belonged to the first group and 59 
belonged to the second group. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 
increase in incidence during the pandemic period (5.91/100,000 children) of 88% 
compared to the pre-pandemic period (3.14/100,000 children). A lesser seasonal 
variation was observed during the pandemic. 30% of the patients in the pandemic 
group had an exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There was no other notable difference in 
demographic factors, clinical presentation, coronary outcome or administered 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prolonged European 
study comparing Kawasaki disease before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. There 
was a significant increase in incidence in Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 
pandemic. In contrast, studies done in Japan, South Korea and the USA have shown 
a decrease in incidence. Differences in methodologies, genetics, ethnicities, 
environments, microbiome-altering behaviors, sanitary measures and SARS-CoV-2 
spread are factors that should be considered. Further studies analyzing the 
differences between countries with increased incidence of Kawasaki disease could 
help better understand the relevance of such factors and provide more insight 
into the etiologies of this particular disease.

In the hepatis B virus (HBV) transgenic mouse model of chronic infection, the 
forkhead box protein A/hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (Foxa/HNF3) family of pioneer 
transcription factors are required to support postnatal viral demethylation and 
subsequent HBV transcription and replication. Liver-specific Foxa-deficient mice 
with hepatic expression of only Foxa3 do not support HBV replication but display 
biliary epithelial hyperplasia with bridging fibrosis. However, liver-specific 
Foxa-deficient mice with hepatic expression of only Foxa1 or Foxa2 also 
successfully restrict viral transcription and replication but display only 
minimal alterations in liver physiology. These observations suggest that the 
level of Foxa activity, rather than the combination of specific Foxa genes, is a 
key determinant of HBV biosynthesis. Together, these findings suggest that 
targeting Foxa activity could lead to HBV DNA methylation and transcriptional 
inactivation, resulting in the resolution of chronic HBV infections that are 
responsible for approximately one million deaths annually worldwide.
IMPORTANCE: The current absence of curative therapies capable of resolving 
chronic hepatis B virus (HBV) infection is a major clinical problem associated 
with considerable morbidity and mortality. The small viral genome limits 
molecular targets for drug development, suggesting that the identification of 
cellular factors essential for HBV biosynthesis may represent alternative 
targets for therapeutic intervention. Genetic Foxa deficiency in the neonatal 
liver of HBV transgenic mice leads to the transcriptional silencing of viral DNA 
by CpG methylation without affecting viability or displaying an obvious 
phenotype. Therefore, limiting liver Foxa activity therapeutically may lead to 
the methylation of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), resulting in 
its transcriptional silencing and ultimately the resolution of chronic HBV 
infection.

Mental health disorders and neurodegenerative diseases place a heavy burden on 
patients and societies, and, although great strides have been made to understand 
the pathophysiology of these conditions, advancement in drug development is 
lagging. The importance of gastrointestinal health in maintaining overall health 
and preventing disease is not a new concept. Hundreds of years ago, healers from 
various cultures and civilizations recognized the crucial role of the gut in 
sustaining health. More than a century ago, scientists began exploring the 
restorative effects of probiotics, marking the early recognition of the 
importance of gut microbes. The omics era brought more enlightenment and enabled 
researchers to identify the complexity of the microbial ecosystems we harbour, 
encompassing bacteria, eukaryotes (including fungi), archaea, viruses, and other 
microorganisms. The extensive genetic capacity of the microbiota is dynamic and 
influenced by the environment. The microbiota therefore serves as a significant 
entity within us, with evolutionarily preserved functions in host metabolism, 
immunity, development, and behavior. The significant role of the bacterial gut 
microbiome in mental health and neurodegenerative disorders has been realized 
and described within the framework of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, 
the bacterial members do not function unaccompanied, but rather in concert, and 
there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the involvement of non-bacterial 
microbiome members in these disorders. In this review, we will explore the 
current literature that implicates a role for the entire metagenomic ensemble, 
and how their complex interkingdom relationships could influence CNS functioning 
in mental health disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

Triatomines are infamous as vectors of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the 
causative agent of Chagas disease. However, climate-driven range expansion and 
urbanization adaptation of triatomine populations, coupled with their highly 
diverse feeding strategies (vertebrate haematophagy, kleptohaematophagy, and 
coprophagy), and has elevated interest in triatomines as potential arboviral 
vectors. Information on the triatomine virome is scant, with prior records 
including only eight insect-specific viruses: Triatoma virus (TrV) and Rhodnius 
prolixus viruses 1-7. Here, we leverage publicly available transcriptome 
datasets to assess viral diversity in 122 wild and colony kissing bugs 
representing eight species from six countries. In total, six viruses were 
detected (including Rhodnius prolixus viruses 4-6), and TrV was detected in 
almost half of all screened triatomines. This is the first report of TrV in 
Triatoma brasiliensis and in members of the genus Mepraia (M. gajardoi, M. 
spinolai, and M. parapatrica), and this effort has vastly expanded the publicly 
available genomic resources of TrV, adding 39 genome sequences to the single 
genome sequence currently available in the GenBank database. Furthermore, two 
additional viruses-Meccus longipennis virus 1 and Drosophila melanogaster Nora 
virus-are herein reported for the first time from kissing bugs. Meccus 
longipennis virus 1 was detected in Triatoma infestans from Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, and Peru, and Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus was found in T. 
infestans from Argentina. Our results illustrate the advantage and utility of 
low-cost transcriptome data mining for the discovery of known and novel 
arboviruses in triatomines and other potential insect vectors.

Detecting pathogens in endangered animal populations is vital for understanding 
and mitigating threats to their survival. The critically endangered western 
ground parrot (Pezoporus flaviventris, WGP), with a population as low as 150 
individuals in Australia, faces an imminent risk of extinction. Despite this 
urgency, research on viral pathogens in this species remains limited. This study 
aimed to identify and characterise viruses present in faecal samples from seven 
individual WGP using a viral metagenomic approach. Analysis of the sequenced 
datasets revealed the presence of a novel virus belonging to the Parvoviridae 
family, named psittaciform chaphamaparvovirus 7 (PsChPV-7). The genome of 
PsChPV-7 contains typical structural and functional gene sequences found in 
Parvoviridae but is highly divergent, indicating its classification as a 
distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis placed PsChPV-7 within a unique 
sub-clade of the Chaphamaparvovirus genus, suggesting its evolutionary 
significance as an ancient lineage within this group. These findings may 
contribute to the development of strategic management and biosecurity plans 
aimed at conserving this endangered WGP.

The human oral cavity and upper airway serves as an early barrier and reservoir 
in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva in this microenvironment may serve as 
a key host factor that can modulate susceptibility to infection and eventual 
infection of the lower respiratory tract. We sought to analyze the content and 
composition of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan identified as an important 
co-receptor for viral entry, and whether there is any correlation with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enlisted 98 participants stratified by age, gender, 
race, and COVID-19 history. Notably, the concentration of heparan sulfate in 
saliva increased with age, and its composition showed a wide range of 
variability within each age group independently of age. Heparan sulfate 
concentration and composition did not differ significantly with gender, 
ethnicity or race. Compared to patients with no COVID-19 history, patients with 
previous infection had a similar salivary heparan sulfate concentration, but 
significant increases in overall sulfation were noted. Moreover, in a subset of 
participants, for which data was available pre- and post- infection, significant 
elevation in N-sulfoglucosamine in heparan sulfate was observed post- COVID-19. 
Examination of salivary bacterial 16S rRNA, showed a significant reduction in 
species predicted to possess heparan sulfate-modifying capacity among 
participants >60 years old, which correlates with the increase in heparan 
sulfate content in older individuals. These findings demonstrate a surprisingly 
wide variation in heparan sulfate content and composition in saliva across the 
sampled population and confirm other findings showing variation in content and 
composition of glycosaminoglycans in blood and urine.

INTRODUCTION: Viral diseases of pinnipeds cause substantial mortality and 
morbidity and can influence population demography. Viral metagenomic studies can 
therefore play an important role in pinniped health assessments and disease 
surveillance relevant to both individual species and in a "One Health" context.
METHODS: This study used a metagenomic approach with high throughput sequencing 
to make the first assessment of viral diversity in Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), 
the only marine mammal species endemic to the Caspian Sea.
RESULTS: Sequencing libraries from 35 seals sampled 2009-2020 were analysed, 
finding sequences from the viral families Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, 
Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Cruciviridae, 
Anelloviridae, Smacoviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae, with additional detection of 
Adenoviridae via PCR. The similarity of viral contigs from Caspian seal to 
sequences recovered from other pinnipeds ranged from 63.74% (San Miguel sea lion 
calicivirus) to 78.79% (Seal anellovirus 4).
DISCUSSION: Some findings represent novel viral species, but overall, the viral 
repertoire of Caspian seals is similar to available viromes from other 
pinnipeds. Among the sequences recovered were partial contigs for influenza B, 
representing only the second such molecular identification in marine mammals. 
This work provides a foundation for further studies of viral communities in 
Caspian seals, the diversity of viromes in pinnipeds more generally, and 
contributes data relevant for disease risk assessments in marine mammals.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection disrupts the homeostatic 
equilibrium between the host and commensal microbes. However, the dynamic 
changes of plasma commensal viruses and their role in HIV/simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) pathogenesis are rarely reported. Here, we 
investigated the longitudinal changes of plasma virome, inflammation levels, and 
disease markers using an SIV-infected Macaca leonina model. Large expansions of 
plasma Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae and other commensal viruses, 
and elevated levels of inflammation and D-dimer were observed since the chronic 
phase of SIV infection. Anelloviridae abundance appears to correlate positively 
with the CD4+ T cell count but negatively with SIV load especially at the acute 
phase, whereas other commensal viruses' abundances show opposite correlations 
with the two disease markers. Antiretroviral therapy slightly reduces but does 
not substantially reverse the expansion of commensal viruses. Furthermore, 1387 
primate anellovirus open reading frame 1 sequences of more than 1500 nucleotides 
were annotated. The data reveal different roles of commensal viruses in SIV 
pathogenesis.

Increasing evidence points to the microbial exposome as a critical factor in 
maturing and shaping the host immune system, thereby influencing responses to 
immune challenges such as infections or vaccines. To investigate the effect of 
early-life viral exposures on immune development and vaccine responses, we 
inoculated mice with six distinct viral pathogens in sequence beginning in the 
neonatal period, and then evaluated their immune signatures before and after 
intramuscular or intranasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Sequential viral 
infection drove profound changes in all aspects of the immune system, including 
increasing circulating leukocytes, altering innate and adaptive immune cell 
lineages in tissues, and markedly influencing serum cytokine and total antibody 
levels. Beyond changes in the immune responses, these exposures also modulated 
the composition of the endogenous intestinal microbiota. Although 
sequentially-infected mice exhibited increased systemic immune activation and T 
cell responses after intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 immunization, we 
observed decreased vaccine-induced antibody responses in these animals. These 
results suggest that early-life viral exposures are sufficient to diminish 
antibody responses to vaccination in mice, and highlight the potential 
importance of considering prior microbial exposures when investigating vaccine 
responses.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
Crohn's disease (CD), is a group of chronic immune-mediated gastrointestinal 
disorders. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial, involving genetic 
susceptibility, environmental factors, and a complex interplay between the gut 
microbiota and the host's immune system. Intestinal resident macrophages play an 
important role in the pathogenesis and progress of IBD, as well as in 
maintaining intestinal homeostasis and facilitating tissue repair. This review 
delves into the intricate relationship between intestinal macrophages and gut 
microbiota, highlighting their pivotal roles in IBD pathogenesis. We discuss the 
impact of macrophage dysregulation and the consequent polarization of different 
phenotypes on intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, we explore the compositional 
and functional alterations in gut microbiota associated with IBD, including the 
emerging significance of fungal and viral components. This review also examines 
the effects of current therapeutic strategies, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid 
(5-ASA), antibiotics, steroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, on gut 
microbiota and macrophage function. We underscore the potential of fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) and probiotics as innovative approaches to 
modulate the gut microbiome in IBD. The aim is to provide insights into the 
development of novel therapies targeting the gut microbiota and macrophages to 
improve IBD management.

This letter emphasizes the need to expand discussions on gut microbiome's role 
in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) by including the 
often-overlooked non-bacterial components of the human gut flora. It highlights 
how viral, fungal and archaeal inhabitants of the gut respond towards gut 
dys-biosis and contribute to disease progression. Viruses such as bacteriophages 
target certain bacterial species and modulate the immune system. Other viruses 
found associated include Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus, John 
Cunningham virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex virus type 6. Fungi 
such as Candida albicans and Malassezia contribute by forming tissue-invasive 
filaments and producing inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Archaea, mainly 
metha-nogens are also found altering the microbial fermentation pathways. This 
corres-pondence, thus underscores the significance of considering the 
pathological and physiological mechanisms of the entire spectrum of the gut 
microbiota to develop effective therapeutic interventions for both IBD and CRC.

BACKGROUND: Early reports showed that patients with COVID-19 had recrudescence 
of previously resolved coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever, VF), and there were 
indications that coinfection had more severe outcomes. We therefore investigated 
serial infection of Coccidioides posadasii and SARS-CoV-2 in a K18-hACE2 mouse 
model to assess disease outcomes.
METHODS: In our model, we challenged K18-hACE2 mice sequentially with a 
sub-lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 and 24 hours later with low virulence strain of 
Coccidioides posadasii, and vice versa, compared to mice that only received a 
single infection challenge. We performed survival and pathogenesis mouse studies 
as well as looked at the systemic immune response differences between treatment 
groups.
RESULTS: Here we show that co-infected groups have a more severe disease 
progression as well as a decrease in survival. Importantly, results differ 
depending on the SARS-CoV-2 variant (WA-1, Delta, or Omicron) and infection 
timing (SARS-CoV-2 first, C. posadasii second or vice versa). We find that 
groups that are infected with the virus first had a decrease in survival, 
increased morbidity and weight loss, increased fungal and viral burdens, 
differences in immune responses, and the amount and size of fungal spherules. We 
also find that groups coinfected with C. posadasii first have a decrease fungal 
burden and inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo model investigation of a coinfection of 
SARS-CoV-2 and Coccidioides. Because of the potential for increased severity of 
disease in a coinfection, we suggest populations that live in areas of high 
coccidioidomycosis endemicity may experience higher incidence of complicated 
disease progression with COVID-19.

Plain Language Summary: The Covid-19 pandemic presented significant challenges 
to healthcare systems. One of these was the increase in secondary infections, 
where a patient had both SARS-Cov2 and another infectious disease. Fungal 
infections co-occurring with or after a Covid-19 infection are of interest due 
to treatment challenges and more severe illness in patients. Valley fever is a 
fungal infection prevalent in the southwestern United States and arid regions of 
Central and South America. Reports from these regions showed an increase in 
Valley fever cases coinciding with the rise of Covid-19. We therefore 
investigated how these two pathogens interacted with each other and the host in 
laboratory-controlled mouse experiments. We observed increased mortality when 
mice were exposed to the virus first followed by a fungal infection. Although 
more investigations are needed, our results should be taken into consideration 
in a clinical setting.

Apicomplexa are single-celled eukaryotes that can infect humans and include the 
mosquito-borne parasite Plasmodium, the cause of malaria. Increasing rates of 
drug resistance in human-only Plasmodium species are reducing the efficacy of 
control efforts and antimalarial treatments. There are also rising cases of P. 
knowlesi, the only zoonotic Plasmodium species that causes severe disease and 
death in humans. Thus, there is a need to develop additional innovative 
strategies to combat malaria. Viruses that infect non-Plasmodium spp. 
Disease-causing protozoa have been shown to affect pathogen life cycle and 
disease outcomes. However, only one virus (Matryoshka RNA virus 1) has been 
identified in Plasmodium, and none have been identified in zoonotic Plasmodium 
species. The rapid expansion of the known RNA virosphere using structure- and 
artificial intelligence-based methods suggests that this dearth is due to the 
divergent nature of RNA viruses that infect protozoa. We leveraged these newly 
uncovered data sets to explore the virome of human-infecting Plasmodium species 
collected in Sabah, east (Borneo) Malaysia. We identified a highly divergent RNA 
virus in two human-infecting P. knowlesi isolates that is related to the 
unclassified group 'ormycoviruses'. By characterising fifteen additional 
ormycoviruses identified in the transcriptomes of arthropods we show that this 
group of viruses exhibits a complex ecology at the arthropod-mammal interface. 
Through the application of artificial intelligence methods, we then demonstrate 
that the ormycoviruses are part of a diverse and unclassified viral taxon. This 
is the first observation of an RNA virus in a zoonotic Plasmodium species. By 
linking small-scale experimental data to large-scale virus discovery advances, 
we characterise the diversity and genomic architecture of an unclassified viral 
taxon. This approach should be used to further explore the virome of 
disease-causing Apicomplexa and better understand how protozoa-infecting viruses 
may affect parasite fitness, pathobiology, and treatment outcomes.

Feline bocaviruses (FBoVs) have been discovered for a decade and are often 
detected in feces, possibly associated with diarrhea in cats. Studies on FBoV 
evolution remain limited and have mainly focused on prevalence and genetic 
characterization. Although genetic recombination serves as a potential mechanism 
in bocavirus evolution, research on this process for FBoVs has been scarce. In 
this study, we characterized 19 complete coding sequences of FBoVs obtained from 
Thai cats, revealing that FBoV-1, -2, and -3 were endemic in Thailand. Genetic 
characterizations showed that most Thai FBoVs were closely related to previously 
detected strains in Thailand and China. Recombination analyses indicated 
intragenic, intraspecies recombination in all FBoV species, with recombination 
breakpoints commonly found in the NP1 and VP1/2 genes, highlighting these genes 
may be hotspots for FBoV recombination. However, no interspecies recombination 
was detected. Selective pressure analysis of various FBoV genes revealed that 
these viruses underwent purifying selection. Although the VP1/2 gene of all FBoV 
species was under the strongest negative selection pressure, positive selection 
sites were only found in FBoV-1 and FBoV-3. This study is the first to identify 
natural recombination in FBoV-2 and FBoV-3 and provides evidence that genetic 
recombination is a potential driver of FBoV evolutions. Additionally, this study 
offers up-to-date information on the genetic characteristics, evolutionary 
dynamics, and selective pressure status of FBoVs, which should be continuously 
monitored.

The gut microbiome is an emerging factor in preventing hypertension, yet the 
influence of gut bacteriophages, viruses infecting bacteria, on this condition 
remains unclear. Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions, which impact the gut 
microbiome, are influenced differentially by temperate and virulent 
bacteriophages. However, the standard technique for studying viral populations, 
viral-like particles (VLPs)-metagenomes, often overlook prophages, the 
intracellular stage of temperate bacteriophages, creating a knowledge gap. To 
address this, we investigated alterations in extracellular and intracellular 
bacteriophages, alongside bacterial populations, in the angiotensin 
II-hypertension model. We sequenced VLPs and bulk DNA from cecal-colonic samples 
collected from male C57BL/6J mice implanted with minipumps containing saline or 
angiotensin II. We assembled 106 bacterial and 816 viral genomes and found that 
gut viral and bacterial populations remained stable between hypertensive and 
normotensive mice. A higher number of temperate viruses were observed across all 
treatments. Although temperate viruses outnumbered virulent viruses, sequencing 
of both VLPs and bulk revealed that virions from virulent viruses were more 
abundant in the murine gut. We then evaluated the impact of low- and high-fiber 
intake on gut microbiome composition in the angiotensin II model. Fiber intake 
significantly influenced the gut microbiome composition and hypertension 
development. Mice receiving high-fiber had lower blood pressure, a higher 
bacterial-encoded carbohydrate-associated enzyme, and a higher total relative 
abundance of temperate viruses than those receiving low-fiber. Our findings 
suggest that phages are not associated with hypertension development in the 
angiotensin II model. However, they support a complex diet-bacteria/phage 
interaction that may be involved in blood pressure regulation.

Anelloviruses are ubiquitous in humans and represent a major component of the 
human virome. Its best-known representative is Torque teno virus (i.e., the 
Alphatorquevirus genus), which is considered a potential immunity biomarker. 
Recent metagenomic investigations revealed not only the extraordinary genomic 
diversity of anellovirus sequences, but also that co-detection of genera, 
genotypes, or species seems to be the rule in humans. SCANellome was developed 
to represent a user-friendly tool to analyze the primate (both human and 
non-human) anellovirus composition at the genus, species, and genotype level 
from metagenomics data based on an up-to-date database. This SCANellome update 
includes >900 additional reference sequences from GenBank. Using a clustering at 
90% identity, the FASTA database was updated and generated 134 new 
representative sequences. Based on ORF1, the analysis of these new sequences 
indicates the presence of 206 potential new species, including four nonhuman 
primates, and adds four new non-human primate species which will be the subject 
of a proposal to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). In 
addition, SCANellome V2 provides now the user with an interactive up-to-date 
phylogenetic analysis (of ORF1) to show the distribution among the 12 human and 
nonhuman primate genera of these new potential species. Finally, the 
Anelloviridae taxonomy was updated to rename species names in binomial format as 
required by the ICTV.

Potyvirus diseases are one of the main challenges facing the production of yam 
(Dioscorea spp.). The objective of this study was to identify the potyviruses 
present in the Dioscorea spp. germplasm collection at Instituto de 
Investigaciones de Viandas Tropicales (INIVIT) to establish methodologies for 
the characterization of the associated diseases. For this purpose, 
immunochemical and molecular methods were used to identify the potyviruses 
present. The symptomatology of Dioscorea spp. at INIVIT's germplasm collection 
was described. In addition, the severity and incidence in the germplasm 
collection and production areas were evaluated. As a result, the first report of 
yam mosaic virus (Potyvirus yamtesselati) and yam mild mosaic virus (Potyvirus 
yamplacidum) in Cuba is presented. The existence of resistant, tolerant, and 
susceptible cultivars to potyvirus-associated diseases in the germplasm 
collection was detected, and the incidence of these diseases was higher than 64% 
in the production areas evaluated. This study represents a step forward in the 
establishment of certification programs for propagating material of Dioscorea 
spp. in Cuba.

The aim of this review was to delve into the extent of mosquito virome coverage 
(proportion of viral reads) via meta-viromic sequencing and uncover potential 
factors of heterogeneity that could impact this coverage. Data sources were 
PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Science-Direct, Google Scholar, and the 
China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Pooled coverage was estimated using 
random-effects modeling, and subgroup analyses further reveal potential 
heterogeneous factors. Within the three mosquito genera studied, Culex exhibited 
the highest pooled viral coverage of mosquito viromes at 7.09% (95% CI: 
3.44-11.91%), followed by Anopheles at 5.28% (95% CI: 0.45-14.93%), and Aedes at 
2.11% (95% CI: 0.58-7.66%). Subgroup analyses showed that multiple processing 
methods significantly affected the viral coverage of mosquito viromes, 
especially pre-treatment of mosquito samples with saline buffer/medium and 
antibiotics prior to DNase/RNase treatment and removal of the host genome prior 
to RNA library construction. In conclusion, the results of this study 
demonstrate that the viral coverage of mosquito viromes varies between mosquito 
genera and that pre-treatment of mosquito samples with saline buffer/medium and 
antibiotics before DNase/RNase treatment and removing host genomes prior to RNA 
library construction are critical for the detection of RNA viruses in mosquito 
vectors using meta-viromic sequencing.

Honey bees are rapidly declining, which poses a significant threat to our 
environment and agriculture industry. These vital insects face a disease complex 
believed to be caused by a combination of parasites, viruses, pesticides, and 
nutritional deficiencies. However, the real aetiology is still enigmatic. Due to 
the conventional analysis methods, we still lack complete insights into the 
honey bee virome and the presence of pathogenic bacteria. To fill this knowledge 
gap, we employed third-generation nanopore metagenomic sequencing on honey bee 
haemolymph to monitor the presence of pathogens over almost a year. This study 
provides valuable insights into the changes in bacterial and viral loads within 
honey bee colonies. We identified different pathogens in the honey bee 
haemolymph, which are not included in honey bee screenings. These pathogens 
comprise the Apis mellifera filamentous virus, Apis rhabdoviruses, and various 
bacteria such as Frischella sp. and Arsenophonus sp. Furthermore, a sharp 
contrast was observed between young and old bees. Our research proposes that 
transgenerational immune priming may play a role in shaping infection patterns 
in honey bees. We observed a significant increase in pathogen loads in the 
spring, followed by a notable decrease in pathogen presence during the summer 
and autumn months. However, certain pathogens seem to be able to evade this 
priming effect, making them particularly intriguing as potential factors 
contributing to mortality. In the future, we aim to expand our research on honey 
bee transgenerational immune priming and investigate its potential in natural 
settings. This knowledge will ultimately enhance honey bee health and decrease 
colony mortality.

After plants transitioned from water to land around 450 million years ago, they 
faced novel pathogenic microbes. Their colonization of diverse habitats was 
driven by anatomical innovations like roots, stomata, and vascular tissue, which 
became central to plant-microbe interactions. However, the impact of these 
innovations on plant immunity and pathogen infection strategies remains poorly 
understood. Here, we explore plant-virus interactions in the bryophyte 
Marchantia polymorpha to gain insights into the evolution of these 
relationships. Virome analysis reveals that Marchantia is predominantly 
associated with RNA viruses. Comparative studies with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 
show that Marchantia shares core defense responses with vascular plants but also 
exhibits unique features, such as a sustained wound response preventing viral 
spread. Additionally, general defense responses in Marchantia are equivalent to 
those restricted to vascular tissues in Nicotiana, suggesting that evolutionary 
acquisition of developmental innovations results in re-routing of defense 
responses in vascular plants.

RNA viruses exhibit vast phylogenetic diversity and can significantly impact 
public health and agriculture. However, current bioinformatics tools for viral 
discovery from metagenomic data frequently generate false positive virus 
results, overestimate viral diversity, and misclassify virus sequences. 
Additionally, current tools often fail to determine virus-host associations, 
which hampers investigation of the potential threat posed by a newly detected 
virus. To address these issues we developed VirID, a software tool specifically 
designed for the discovery and characterization of RNA viruses from metagenomic 
data. The basis of VirID is a comprehensive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
database to enhance a workflow that includes RNA virus discovery, phylogenetic 
analysis, and phylogeny-based virus characterization. Benchmark tests on a 
simulated data set demonstrated that VirID had high accuracy in profiling 
viruses and estimating viral richness. In evaluations with real-world samples, 
VirID was able to identify RNA viruses of all types, but also provided accurate 
estimations of viral genetic diversity and virus classification, as well as 
comprehensive insights into virus associations with humans, animals, and plants. 
VirID therefore offers a robust tool for virus discovery and serves as a 
valuable resource in basic virological studies, pathogen surveillance, and early 
warning systems for infectious disease outbreaks.

Crustaceans are important food sources worldwide and possess significant 
ecological status in the marine ecosystem. However, our understanding of the 
diversity and evolution of RNA viruses in crustaceans, especially in economic 
crustaceans, is still limited. Here, 106 batches of economic crustaceans 
including 13 species were collected from 24 locations in China during 2016-2021. 
We identified 90 RNA viruses, 69 of which were divergent from the known viruses. 
Viral transcripts were assigned to 18 different viral families/clades and three 
unclassified groups. Among the identified viruses, five were double-stranded RNA 
viruses, 74 were positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses, nine were 
negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses, and two belonged to an 
unclassified RNA virus group. Phylogenetic analyses showed that crustacean 
viruses were often clustered with viruses identified from invertebrates. 
Remarkably, most crustacean viruses were closely related to those from different 
host species along the same food chain or ecological aquatic niche. In addition, 
the genome structures of the newly discovered picornaviruses exhibited 
remarkable diversity. Our study significantly expands the diversity of viruses 
in important economic crustaceans and provides essential data for the risk 
assessment of the pathogens spreading in the global aquaculture industry.
IMPORTANCE: The study delves into the largely uncharted territory of RNA viruses 
in crustaceans, which are not only vital for global food supply but also play a 
pivotal role in marine ecosystems. Focusing on economic crustaceans, the 
research uncovers 90 RNA viruses, with 69 being potentially new to science, 
highlighting the vast unknown viral diversity within these marine organisms. The 
findings reveal that these viruses are often related to those found in other 
invertebrates and tend to share close relationships with viruses from species 
within the same food web or habitat. This suggests that viruses may move between 
different marine species more frequently than previously thought. The discovery 
of such a wide variety of viruses, particularly the diverse genome structures of 
newly identified picornaviruses, is a significant leap forward in understanding 
the crustacean virology. This knowledge is crucial for managing disease risks in 
aquaculture and maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems.

Amid global health concerns and the constant threat of zoonotic diseases, this 
study delves into the diversity of circular replicase-encoding single-stranded 
DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses within Chinese wild bird populations. Employing viral 
metagenomics to tackle the challenge of "viral dark matter," the research 
collected and analyzed 3,404 cloacal swab specimens across 26 bird families. 
Metagenomic analysis uncovered a rich viral landscape, with 67.48% of reads 
classified as viral dark matter, spanning multiple taxonomic levels. Notably, 
certain viral families exhibited host-specific abundance patterns, with 
Galliformes displaying the highest diversity. Diversity analysis categorized 
samples into distinct groups, revealing significant differences in viral 
community structure, particularly noting higher diversity in terrestrial birds 
compared to songbirds and unique diversity in migratory birds versus perching 
birds. The identification of ten novel Circoviridae viruses, seven Smacoviridae 
viruses, and 167 Genomoviridae viruses, along with 100 unclassified CRESS-DNA 
viruses, underscores the expansion of knowledge on avian-associated circular DNA 
viruses. Phylogenetic and structural analyses of Rep proteins offered insights 
into evolutionary relationships and potential functional variations among 
CRESS-DNA viruses. In conclusion, this study significantly enhances our 
understanding of the avian virome, shedding light on the intricate relationships 
between viral communities and host characteristics in Chinese wild bird 
populations. The diverse array of CRESS-DNA viruses discovered opens avenues for 
future research into viral evolution, spread factors, and potential ecosystem 
impacts.

Flowering ginger (Alpinia purpurata) is economically and culturally important in 
Hawaii. In the past decade, a slow decline syndrome has impacted the production 
of this crop in the state. RNA sequencing analyses and virus indexing surveys 
were done on samples collected from four of the Hawaiian Islands. Viral 
sequences corresponding to six viruses were recovered from transcriptomic data 
from samples with virus-like symptoms. Canna yellow mottle virus (CaYMV, genus 
Badnavirus) and two novel viruses, Alpinia vein clearing virus (ApVCV, genus 
Ampelovirus) and Alpinia vein streaking virus (ApVSV, genus 
Betanucleorhabdovirus), were found at a moderate incidence in diseased plants. 
Conversely, three other viruses, including the two potyviruses, banana bract 
mosaic virus and bean common mosaic virus, and a badnavirus, banana streak GF 
virus, were also found but at a low incidence. Virus detection in potential 
insect vectors and transmission assays identified the mealybug Planococcus citri 
as a vector of CaYMV and ApVCV, whereas the aphid Pentalonia caladii was 
identified as a vector of the novel ApVSV. Both P. citri and P. caladii are 
common pests of flowering ginger in Hawaii. Transmission of ApVSV was achieved 
using P. caladii colonies either established in the laboratory or naturally 
feeding on infected plants, although no transmission was obtained using 
viruliferous aphids originally reared on taro (Colocasia esculenta). Our study 
provides insights into the potential association between viral infections and 
the observed decline symptoms of flowering ginger in Hawaii. However, more 
definitive studies are needed to link single or mixed viral infections with 
decline symptoms.

South Africa has a small but growing olive industry. Until now, no virological 
research has been carried out on this crop locally. Seventeen samples were 
collected from various olive cultivars from a single producer in the 
Stellenbosch growing area of South Africa. RNAseq was performed on total RNA, 
and the compositions of the metaviromes were determined. Olive leaf 
yellowing-associated virus was detected for the first time in South Africa, as 
well as four novel viruses from the family Closteroviridae and one each from the 
families Tymoviridae and Solemoviridae.
