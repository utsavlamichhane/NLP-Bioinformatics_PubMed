BACKGROUND: Codonopsis pilosula is a traditional herb widely used in Asian 
countries. As regulatory institutions increasingly acknowledge its medicinal and 
food-related characteristics, the attention from scholars is expected to 
increase rapidly. However, an overview and reports on research focus on this 
promising herb are currently lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was 
to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review of relevant 
literature to explore the developing history and research focus on C. pilosula. 
This research is of significant importance in gaining a deeper understanding of 
the potential benefits and application areas of C. pilosula.
METHOD: The output, institutions, countries, authors, highly cited publications, 
frontier focus and funding agencies of C. pilosula were analyzed using 
VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and COOC software.
RESULTS: The development of C. pilosula experienced 3 stages: initial stage 
(1979-2002), fast stage (2003-2012), and explosive stage (2013-present), with 
each stage showing linear growth. Worldwide attention from 1292 institutions in 
27 countries have been paid, with China leading in output and collaboration. 
Lanzhou University in China contributed most publications with Fangdi Hu as a 
core specialist facilitating collaborations in agricultural and pharmacological 
research. A stable cooperation network has formed among researchers from 
different fields, focusing on pharmacological activity, chemical constituents, 
quality control, and medication rules. The research focus updated timely with 
new scientific frontiers occur. Medication rules, data mining, molecular 
docking, traditional Chinese medicine, gut microbiota, and polysaccharide are 
frontier focus presently and in the near future. Significant attention and 
funding have been provided by the national and local government of Gansu 
province in China.
CONCLUSION: Research on C. pilosula is thriving, particularly in China, with a 
promising future in traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology. This study 
provides valuable insights for future research directions and contributes to the 
effective development of C. pilosula.

BACKGROUND: The gut-microbiome-brain axis (GMBA) implies the connection between 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to 
comprehensively explore the relation between IBD (and its subtypes) and AD, 
early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) from a genetic pleiotropy 
perspective.
METHODS: Relying on summary statistics (N = 472,868 for AD, 185,204 for EOAD, 
191,061 for LOAD, 59,957 for IBD, 45,975 for CD, and 40,266 for UC), we first 
performed Mendelian Randomization to examine the causal association between IBD 
and AD by leveraging vertical pleiotropy. Then, we estimated global and local 
genetic correlations, followed by cross-trait association analysis to identify 
SNPs and genes with horizontal pleiotropy. Particularly, we utilized multi-trait 
colocalization analysis to assess the role of microbes in the common genetic 
etiology underlying the two types of diseases. Finally, we conducted functional 
enrichment analysis for pleiotropic genes.
RESULTS: We discovered suggestively causal relations between IBD (and its 
subtypes) and EOAD (ORIBD = 1.06 [1.01-1.11], ORCD = 1.05 [1.01-1.10], 
ORUC = 1.08 [1.01-1.15]) as well as between UC and LOAD (OR = 1.04 [1.01-1.08]), 
and discovered 44 local regions showing suggestively significant genetic 
correlations between IBD (and its subtypes) and AD (and EODA and LOAD). We 
further detected substantial genetic overlap, as characterized by 182  
AD-associated, 3 EOAD-associated and 51 LOAD-associated pleiotropic SNPs as well 
as 291 pleiotropic genes. Pleiotropic genes more likely enriched in the 
GMBA-relevant tissues such as brain, intestine and esophagus. Moreover, we 
identified three microorganisms related to these disease pairs, including the 
Catenibacterium, Clostridia, and Prevotella species.
CONCLUSION: The suggestively causal associations and shared genetic basis 
between IBD and its subtypes with AD, EOAD and LOAD may commonly drive their 
co-occurrence, and gut microbes might partly explain the shared genetic 
etiology. Further studies are warranted to elaborate the possibly biological 
mechanisms underlying the two types of diseases.

BACKGROUND: Advances in metagenome sequencing data continue to enable new 
methods for analyzing biological systems. When handling microbial profile data, 
metagenome sequencing has proven to be far more comprehensive than traditional 
methods such as 16s rRNA data, which rely on partial sequences. Microbial 
community profiling can be used to obtain key biological insights that pave the 
way for more accurate understanding of complex systems that are critical for 
advancing biomedical research and healthcare. However, such attempts have mostly 
used partial or incomplete data to accurately capture those associations.
METHODS: This study introduces a novel computational approach for the 
identification of co-occurring microbial communities using the abundance and 
functional roles of species-level microbiome data. The proposed approach is then 
used to identify signature pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). Furthermore, we developed a computational pipeline to identify microbial 
species co-occurrences from metagenome data at various granularity levels.
RESULTS: When comparing the IBD group to a control group, we show that certain 
co-occurring communities of species are enriched for potential pathways. We also 
show that the identified co-occurring microbial species operate as a community 
to facilitate pathway enrichment.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained findings suggest that the proposed network model, 
along with the computational pipeline, provide a valuable analytical tool to 
analyze complex biological systems and extract pathway signatures that can be 
used to diagnose certain health conditions.

The tumor microbiome, a complex community of microbes found in tumors, has been 
found to be linked to cancer development, progression, and treatment outcome. 
However, it remains a bottleneck in distangling the relationship between the 
tumor microbiome and host gene expressions in tumor microenvironment, as well as 
their concert effects on patient survival. In this study, we aimed to decode 
this complex relationship by developing ASD-cancer (autoencoder-based subtypes 
detector for cancer), a semi-supervised deep learning framework that could 
extract survival-related features from tumor microbiome and transcriptome data, 
and identify patients' survival subtypes. By using tissue samples from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified two statistically distinct survival 
subtypes across all 20 types of cancer Our framework provided improved risk 
stratification (e.g., for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, [LIHC], log-rank test, 
P = 8.12E-6) compared to PCA (e.g., for LIHC, log-rank test, P = 0.87), 
predicted survival subtypes accurately, and identified biomarkers for survival 
subtypes. Additionally, we identified potential interactions between microbes 
and host genes that may play roles in survival. For instance, in LIHC, 
Arcobacter, Methylocella, and Isoptericola may regulate host survival through 
interactions with host genes enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, indicating 
these species as potential therapy targets. Further experiments on validation 
data sets have also supported these patterns. Collectively, ASD-cancer has 
enabled accurate survival subtyping and biomarker discovery, which could 
facilitate personalized treatment for broad-spectrum types of 
cancers.IMPORTANCEUnraveling the intricate relationship between the tumor 
microbiome, host gene expressions, and their collective impact on cancer 
outcomes is paramount for advancing personalized treatment strategies. Our study 
introduces ASD-cancer, a cutting-edge autoencoder-based subtype detector. 
ASD-cancer decodes the complexities within the tumor microenvironment, 
successfully identifying distinct survival subtypes across 20 cancer types. Its 
superior risk stratification, demonstrated by significant improvements over 
traditional methods like principal component analysis, holds promise for 
refining patient prognosis. Accurate survival subtype predictions, biomarker 
discovery, and insights into microbe-host gene interactions elevate ASD-cancer 
as a powerful tool for advancing precision medicine. These findings not only 
contribute to a deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment but also open 
avenues for personalized interventions across diverse cancer types, underscoring 
the transformative potential of ASD-cancer in shaping the future of cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Vestimentiferan tubeworms are deep-sea colonizers, in which 
chemoautotrophic symbiosis was first observed. These animals are gutless and 
depend on endosymbiotic bacteria for organic compound synthesis and nutrition 
supply. Taxonomically, vestimentiferans belong to Siboglinidae and Annelida. 
Compared with other siboglinids, vestimentiferans are distinguished by high 
tolerance of the prevailing hydrogen sulfide in hydrothermal vents, rapid growth 
in local habitats, and a physical structure consisting of a thick chitinous 
tube. The metabolic mechanisms contributing to these features remain elusive.
RESULTS: Comparative genomics revealed that unlike other annelids, 
vestimentiferans possessed trehaloneogenesis and lacked gluconeogenesis. 
Transcriptome and metabolome analyses detected the expression of 
trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase (TPSP), the key enzyme of 
trehaloneogenesis, and trehalose production in vestimentiferan tissues. In 
addition to trehaloneogenesis, glycogen biosynthesis evidenced by packed 
glycogen granules was also found in vestimentiferan symbionts, but not in other 
Siboglinidae symbionts. Data mining and analyses of invertebrate TPSP revealed 
that the TPSP in Vestimentifera, as well as Cnidaria, Rotifera, Urochordata, and 
Cephalochordata, likely originated from Arthropoda, possibly as a result of 
transposon-mediated inter-phyla gene transfer.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates a critical role of bacterial glycogen 
biosynthesis in the highly efficient symbiont - vestimentiferan cooperation. 
This study provides a new perspective for understanding the environmental 
adaptation strategies of vestimentiferans and adds new insights into the 
mechanism of metabolic evolution in Metazoa. Video Abstract.

In Pseudomonas donghuensis SVBP6, isolated from an agricultural field, the 
well-conserved Gac-Rsm pathway upregulates biosynthesis of the antifungal 
compound 7-hydroxytropolone (7-HT). However, 7-HT does not fully explain the 
strain's Gac-Rsm-dependent antimicrobial activity. Here, we combined comparative 
transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches to identify novel 
GacS-dependent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) and/or extracellular specialized 
metabolites. Our data revealed a broad impact of GacS on gene expression and 
extracellular metabolite profile of SVBP6. At both the mRNA and polypeptide 
levels, specialized metabolism was the main affected functional category in the 
gacS mutant. The major extracellular MS/MS spectral families promoted by GacS 
were fatty acid amides, fatty acids, and alkaloids. GacS was required for the 
production of the antimicrobial compound pseudoiodinine and to activate 
expression of the corresponding BGC. We also detected GacS-dependent production 
of 2,3,4-trihydro-β-carboline-1-one, which may add to the antimicrobial arsenal 
of SVBP6. Furthermore, transcriptomics and proteomics pinpointed several 
GacS-activated BGCs that had escaped in silico genome mining tools. Altogether, 
comparative multi-omics analyses of gacS loss-of-function mutants in Pseudomonas 
isolates are a promising strategy to uncover bioactive metabolites and/or their 
BGCs. Discovery of novel natural products is important for harnessing the 
potential of microbiota to improve crop plant growth and health.

The TP53 mutation is one of the most common gene mutations in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and plays a significant role in the occurrence, development, 
and prognosis of both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell 
carcinoma (LUSC). Recent studies have also suggested the predictive value of 
TP53 mutations in the response to immunotherapy for NSCLC. It is known that 
intratumoral microbiota, tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and histology are 
associated with the roles of TP53 mutation in NSCLC. However, the intrinsic 
associations among these three factors and their underlying interaction with 
TP53 mutation are not well understood. Additionally, the potential of predicting 
TP53 mutations using deep learning methods has not yet been fully evaluated. In 
this paper, we comprehensively evaluated the tissue microbiome, host gene 
expression characteristics, and histopathological slides of 992 NSCLC patients 
obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and validated the findings using 
multi-omics data of 332 NSCLC patients from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor 
Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Compared to LUSC, LUAD exhibited more substantial 
differences between patients with and without TP53 mutation in all three 
aspects. In LUAD, our results imply underlying links between the tissue 
microbiome and immune cell components in the TIME, and show that the abundance 
of immune cells is reflected in histology slides. Furthermore, we propose a 
novel multimodal deep learning model that focuses on histopathology images, 
which achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 in LUAD. In summary, TP53 
mutation of LUAD resulted more significant changes in intratumoral microbiota, 
TIME and histology than that of LUSC. And histopathology images can be used to 
predict TP53 mutation in LUAD with reasonable accuracy.

The microbiome represents the natural presence of microorganisms, and exploring, 
understanding, and leveraging its functions will bring about significant 
breakthroughs in life sciences and applications. Raman-activated cell sorting 
(RACS) enables the correlation of phenotype and genotype at the single-cell 
level, offering a solution to the bottleneck in microbial community functional 
analysis caused by challenges in cultivating diverse microorganisms. However, 
current labor-intensive manual procedures fall short in catering to the demands 
of single-cell functional analysis in microbial communities. To address this 
issue, we developed an artificial intelligence-assisted Raman-activated cell 
sorting system (AI-RACS) that integrates precise single-cell positioning, 
automated data collection, optical tweezers capture, and single-cell printing to 
elevate microbial single-cell RACS from manual to automated, validating the 
efficacy of the system by isolating aluminum-tolerant microbes from acidic soil 
microbiota. Leveraging the AI-RACS framework, we sorted 13 strains from red soil 
samples under near-in situ conditions, with all demonstrating strong aluminum 
tolerance. AI-RACS efficiently segregates microbial cells from intricate 
environmental samples, investigating their functional attributes and presenting 
a novel tool for microbial research and applications.

The maize leafhopper (Dalbulus maidis) is a significant threat to maize crops in 
tropical and subtropical regions, causing extensive economic losses. While its 
ecological interactions and control strategies are well studied, its associated 
viral diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ high-throughput 
sequencing data mining to comprehensively characterize the D. maidis RNA virome, 
revealing novel and diverse RNA viruses. We characterized six new viral members 
belonging to distinct families, with evolutionary cues of beny-like viruses 
(Benyviridae), bunya-like viruses (Bunyaviridae) iflaviruses (Iflaviridae), 
orthomyxo-like viruses (Orthomyxoviridae), and rhabdoviruses (Rhabdoviridae). 
Phylogenetic analysis of the iflaviruses places them within the genus Iflavirus 
in affinity with other leafhopper-associated iflaviruses. The five-segmented and 
highly divergent orthomyxo-like virus showed a relationship with other insect 
associated orthomyxo-like viruses. The rhabdo virus is related to a 
leafhopper-associated rhabdo-like virus. Furthermore, the beny-like virus 
belonged to a cluster of insect-associated beny-like viruses, while the 
bi-segmented bunya-like virus was related with other bi-segmented 
insect-associated bunya-like viruses. These results highlight the existence of a 
complex virome linked to D. maidis and paves the way for future studies 
investigating the ecological roles, evolutionary dynamics, and potential 
biocontrol applications of these viruses on the D. maidis-maize pathosystem.

Leaderless bacteriocins are a unique class of bacteriocins that possess 
antimicrobial activity after translation and have few cases of documented 
resistance. Aureocin A53 and lacticin Q are considered two of the most 
well-studied leaderless bacteriocins. Here, we used in silico genome mining to 
search for novel aureocin A53-like leaderless bacteriocins in GenBank and 
MGnify. We identified 757 core peptides across 430 genomes with 75 species found 
currently without characterized leaderless bacteriocin production. These include 
putative novel species containing bacteriocin gene clusters (BGCs) from the 
genera Streptomyces (sp. NBC_00237) and Agrococcus (sp. SL85). To date, all 
characterized leaderless bacteriocins have been found within the phylum 
Bacillota, but this study identified 97 core peptides within the phylum 
Actinomycetota. Members of this phylum are traditionally associated with the 
production of antibiotics, such is the case with the genus Streptomyces. 
Actinomycetota is an underexplored phylum in terms of bacteriocin production 
with no characterized leaderless bacteriocin production to date. The two novel 
leaderless bacteriocins arcanocin and arachnicin from Actinomycetota members 
Arcanobacterium sp. and Arachnia sp., respectively, were chemically synthesized 
and antimicrobial activity was verified. These peptides were encoded in human 
gut (PRJNA485056) and oral (PRJEB43277) microbiomes, respectively. This research 
highlights the biosynthetic potential of Actinomycetota in terms of leaderless 
bacteriocin production and describes the first antimicrobial peptides encoded in 
the genera Arcanobacterium and Arachnia.IMPORTANCEBacteriocins are gathering 
attention as alternatives to current antibiotics given the increasing incidence 
of antimicrobial resistance. Leaderless bacteriocins are considered a 
commercially attractive subclass of bacteriocins due to the ability to 
synthesize active peptide and low levels of documented resistance. Therefore, in 
this work, we mined publicly available data to determine how widespread and 
diverse leaderless bacteriocins are within the domain of bacteria. 
Actinomycetota, known for its antibiotic producers but lacking described and 
characterized bacteriocins, proved to be a rich source of leaderless 
bacteriocins-97 in total. Two such peptides, arcanocin and arachnicin, were 
chemically synthesized and have antimicrobial activity. These bacteriocins may 
provide a novel source of novel antimicrobials that could aid in the development 
of future alternative antimicrobials and highlight that the Actinomycetota are 
an underexplored resource of bacteriocin peptides.

Triatomines are infamous as vectors of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the 
causative agent of Chagas disease. However, climate-driven range expansion and 
urbanization adaptation of triatomine populations, coupled with their highly 
diverse feeding strategies (vertebrate haematophagy, kleptohaematophagy, and 
coprophagy), and has elevated interest in triatomines as potential arboviral 
vectors. Information on the triatomine virome is scant, with prior records 
including only eight insect-specific viruses: Triatoma virus (TrV) and Rhodnius 
prolixus viruses 1-7. Here, we leverage publicly available transcriptome 
datasets to assess viral diversity in 122 wild and colony kissing bugs 
representing eight species from six countries. In total, six viruses were 
detected (including Rhodnius prolixus viruses 4-6), and TrV was detected in 
almost half of all screened triatomines. This is the first report of TrV in 
Triatoma brasiliensis and in members of the genus Mepraia (M. gajardoi, M. 
spinolai, and M. parapatrica), and this effort has vastly expanded the publicly 
available genomic resources of TrV, adding 39 genome sequences to the single 
genome sequence currently available in the GenBank database. Furthermore, two 
additional viruses-Meccus longipennis virus 1 and Drosophila melanogaster Nora 
virus-are herein reported for the first time from kissing bugs. Meccus 
longipennis virus 1 was detected in Triatoma infestans from Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, and Peru, and Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus was found in T. 
infestans from Argentina. Our results illustrate the advantage and utility of 
low-cost transcriptome data mining for the discovery of known and novel 
arboviruses in triatomines and other potential insect vectors.

The approval and effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in head-and-neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) highlights the role of the immune system in this 
tumor entity. HNSCCs not only interacts with the immune system in the tumor 
tissue, but also induce systemic effects that may be additionally influenced by 
further factors such as the microbiome. Nonetheless, reliable immunological 
biomarkers that predict treatment response and outcome in HNSCC patients are 
lacking. The currently available biomarkers are mainly limited to analyses from 
tumor biopsies, while biomarkers from liquid biopsies, such as peripheral blood 
are not well-established. Thus, the here presented trial aims to identify 
interactions of intra-tumoral and systemic immune responses and to define 
prognostic immune signatures. Consequently, not only samples from the tumor 
tissue, but also from peripheral blood and the microbiome will be studied/are 
being evaluated and correlated with the clinical outcome. In this prospective, 
multi-center trial, 1000 HNSCC patients and 100 patients in the control cohort 
with non-tumor head-and-neck surgery will be enrolled. The local immune status 
from of the tumor and the microbiome will be sampled before treatment. In 
addition, the systemic immune status from peripheral blood will be analyzed 
before and after surgery and after the adjuvant and definitive 
radio-chemotherapy (RCT). Clinical baseline characteristics and outcome will 
additionally be collected. Data mining and modelling approaches will finally be 
applied to identify interactions of local and systemic immune parameters and to 
define prognostic immune signatures based on the evaluated immune markers. 
Approval from the institutional review board of the 
Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg was granted in December 2021 
(application number 21-440-B). By now, 150 patients have been enrolled in the 
intervention cohort. The results will be disseminated to the scientific audience 
and the general public via presentations at conferences and publication in 
peer-reviewed journals.

Advanced omics technologies and facilities generate a wealth of valuable data 
daily; however, the data often lack the essential metadata required for 
researchers to find, curate, and search them effectively. The lack of metadata 
poses a significant challenge in the utilization of these data sets. Machine 
learning (ML)-based metadata extraction techniques have emerged as a potentially 
viable approach to automatically annotating scientific data sets with the 
metadata necessary for enabling effective search. Text labeling, usually 
performed manually, plays a crucial role in validating machine-extracted 
metadata. However, manual labeling is time-consuming and not always feasible; 
thus, there is a need to develop automated text labeling techniques in order to 
accelerate the process of scientific innovation. This need is particularly 
urgent in fields such as environmental genomics and microbiome science, which 
have historically received less attention in terms of metadata curation and 
creation of gold-standard text mining data sets. In this paper, we present two 
novel automated text labeling approaches for the validation of ML-generated 
metadata for unlabeled texts, with specific applications in environmental 
genomics. Our techniques show the potential of two new ways to leverage existing 
information that is only available for select documents within a corpus to 
validate ML models, which can then be used to describe the remaining documents 
in the corpus. The first technique exploits relationships between different 
types of data sources related to the same research study, such as publications 
and proposals. The second technique takes advantage of domain-specific 
controlled vocabularies or ontologies. In this paper, we detail applying these 
approaches in the context of environmental genomics research for ML-generated 
metadata validation. Our results show that the proposed label assignment 
approaches can generate both generic and highly specific text labels for the 
unlabeled texts, with up to 44% of the labels matching with those suggested by a 
ML keyword extraction algorithm.

BACKGROUND: Shallow, tropical coral reefs face compounding threats from climate 
change, habitat degradation due to coastal development and pollution, impacts 
from storms and sea-level rise, and pulse disturbances like blast fishing, 
mining, dredging, and ship groundings that reduce reef height and complexity. 
One approach toward restoring coral reef physical structure from such impacts is 
deploying built structures of artificial, natural, or hybrid (both artificial 
and natural) origin. Built structures range from designed modules and repurposed 
materials to underwater sculptures and intentionally placed natural rocks. 
Restoration practitioners and coastal managers increasingly consider 
incorporating - and in many cases have already begun to incorporate - built 
structures into coral reef-related applications, yet synthesized evidence on the 
ecological (coral-related; e.g., coral growth, coral survival) and physical 
performance of built structures in coral ecosystems across a variety of contexts 
(e.g., restoration, coastal protection, mitigation, tourism) is not readily 
available to guide decisions. To help fill this gap and inform management 
decisions, we systematically mapped the global distribution and abundance of 
published evidence on the ecological (coral-related) and physical performance of 
built structure interventions in shallow (≤ 30 m), tropical (35°N to 35°S) coral 
ecosystems.
METHODS: To identify potentially relevant articles, we used predefined and 
tested strategies to search two indexing platforms, one bibliographic database, 
two open discovery citation indexes, one web-based search engine, one novel 
literature discovery tool, 19 organizational websites, and information requested 
from stakeholders. Discovered articles were screened according to preset 
eligibility criteria first by title and abstract and second by full text. 
Articles included during full text screening were coded to extract metadata 
following a predefined framework. We analyzed and visualized the evidence base 
to answer our primary and secondary research questions and to identify knowledge 
clusters and gaps. Findings are reported in a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Our search discovered > 20,000 potentially relevant unique articles, of 
which 258 were included in the systematic map. The evidence base spans 50 
countries, and the volume of evidence increased over the past five decades. 
Built structures were most commonly installed for coral restoration (61%) or 
coastal protection (12%). Structures were predominately characterized as 
artificial (87%), with fewer hybrid or natural interventions. Evidence clusters 
existed for intentionally designed artificial structures and outcomes associated 
with coral-related ecological performance, including coral mortality, growth, 
recruitment, cover, and diversity. Pronounced evidence gaps occurred at the 
intersection of several ecological coral-related performance outcomes (e.g., 
connectivity, microbiome) across all types of built structures; gaps also 
existed across most ecological coral-related outcomes for artwork and repurposed 
artificial structures. Physical performance of built structures was most 
frequently evaluated for outcomes related to waves (n = 14) and sediment and 
morphology (n = 11) with pervasive evidence gaps across other outcomes like 
storm surge and water level.
CONCLUSIONS: While the systematic map highlighted several evidence clusters, it 
also revealed pronounced evidence gaps surrounding the coral-related ecological 
and physical performance of built structures in coral ecosystems. The compiled 
evidence base will help inform policy, management, and future consideration of 
built structures in reef-related applications, including habitat restoration, 
environmental mitigation, and coastal protection. Map findings also point to 
promising future research avenues, such as investigating seascape-scale 
ecological effects of and the physical performance of built structures.

The sewer system, despite being a significant source of methane emissions, has 
often been overlooked in current greenhouse gas inventories due to the limited 
availability of quantitative data. Direct monitoring in sewers can be expensive 
or biased due to access limitations and internal heterogeneity of sewer 
networks. Fortunately, since methane is almost exclusively biogenic in sewers, 
we demonstrate in this study that the methanogenic potential can be estimated 
using known sewer microbiome data. By combining data mining techniques and 
bioinformatics databases, we developed the first data-driven method to analyze 
methanogenic potentials using a data set containing 633 observations of 53 
variables obtained from literature mining. The methanogenic potential in the 
sewer sediment was around 250-870% higher than that in the wet biofilm on the 
pipe and sewage water. Additionally, k-means clustering and principal component 
analysis linked higher methane emission rates (9.72 ± 51.3 kgCO2 eq m-3 d-1) 
with smaller pipe size, higher water level, and higher potentials of sulfate 
reduction in the wetted pipe biofilm. These findings exhibit the possibility of 
connecting microbiome data with biogenic greenhouse gases, further offering 
insights into new approaches for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from 
understudied sources.

Intratumoral microbiota and host genes interact to promote gastrointestinal 
disorders, but how the two interact to influence host tumorigenesis remains 
unclear. Here, we utilized a machine learning-based framework to jointly dissect 
the paired intratumoral microbiome and host transcriptome profiles in patients 
with colon adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer. We 
identified associations between intratumoral microbes and host genes that depict 
shared as well as cancer type-specific patterns. We found that a common set of 
host genes and pathways implicated in cell proliferation and energy metabolism 
are associated with cancer type-specific intratumoral microbes. In addition, we 
also found that intratumoral microbes that have been implicated in three 
gastrointestinal tumors, such as Lachnoclostridium, are correlated with 
different host pathways in each tumor, indicating that similar microbes can 
influence host tumorigenesis in a cancer type-specific manner by regulation of 
different host genes. Our study reveals patterns of association between 
intratumoral microbiota and host genes in gastrointestinal tumors, providing new 
insights into the biology of gastrointestinal tumors.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study 
constitutes a pivotal advancement in elucidating the intricate relationship 
between the intratumoral microbiome and host gene regulation, thereby gaining 
insights into the pivotal role that the intratumoral microbiome plays in the 
etiology of gastrointestinal tumors.

The pig gut virome plays a vital role in the gut microbial ecosystem of pigs. 
However, a comprehensive understanding of their diversity and a reference 
database for the virome are currently lacking. To address this gap, we 
established a Pig Virome Database (PVD) that comprised of 5,566,804 viral contig 
sequences from 4650 publicly available gut metagenomic samples using a pipeline 
designated "metav". By clustering sequences, we identified 48,299 viral 
operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) genomes of at least medium quality, of which 
92.83% of which were not found in existing major databases. The majority of 
vOTUs were identified as Caudoviricetes (72.21%). The PVD database contained a 
total of 2,362,631 protein-coding genes across the above medium-quality vOTUs 
genomes that can be used to explore the functional potential of the pig gut 
virome. These findings highlight the extensive diversity of viruses in the pig 
gut and provide a pivotal reference dataset for forthcoming research concerning 
the pig gut virome.

The Red Sea is a promising habitat for the discovery of new bioactive marine 
natural products. Sponges associated microorganisms represent a wealthy source 
of compounds with unique chemical structures and diverse biological activities. 
Metagenomics is an important omics-based culture-independent technique that is 
used as an effective tool to get genomic and functional information on sponge 
symbionts. In this study, we used metagenomic analysis of two Egyptian Red Sea 
sponges Hyrtios erectus and Phorbas topsenti microbiomes to study the 
biodiversity and the biosynthetic potential of the Red Sea sponges to produce 
bioactive compounds. Our data revealed high biodiversity of the two sponges' 
microbiota with phylum Proteobacteria as the most dominant phylum in the 
associated microbial community with an average of 31% and 70% respectively. The 
analysis also revealed high biosynthetic potential of sponge Hyrtios erectus 
microbiome through detecting diverse types of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) 
with predicted cytotoxic, antibacterial and inhibitory action. Most of these 
BGCs were predicted to be novel as they did not show any similarity with any 
MIBiG database known cluster. This study highlights the importance of the 
microbiome of the collected Red Sea sponge Hyrtios erectus as a valuable source 
of new bioactive natural products.

Mammals host a remarkable diversity and abundance of gut microbes. Biosynthetic 
gene clusters (BGCs) in microbial genomes encode biologically active chemical 
products and play an important role in microbe-host interactions. Traditionally, 
the exploration of gut microbial metabolic functions has relied on the pure 
culture method. However, given the limited amounts of microbes being cultivated, 
insights into the metabolism of gut microbes in mammals continued to be very 
limited. In this study, we adopted a computational pipeline for mining the 
metagenomic data (named taxonomy-guided identification of biosynthetic gene 
clusters, TaxiBGC) to identify experimentally verified BGCs in 373 metagenomes 
across 53 mammalian species in an unbiased manner. We demonstrated that 
polyketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are representative of 
mammals, and the products derived from them were associated with cell-cell 
communication and resistance to inflammation. Large carnivores had the highest 
number of BGCs, followed by large herbivores and small mammals. We also observed 
that the large mammals had more common BGCs that aid in the biosynthesis of a 
variety of natural products. However, small mammals not only had fewer BGCs but 
were also unique to each species. Our results provide novel insights into the 
mining of metagenomic data sets to identify active BGCs and their products 
across mammals.IMPORTANCEThe gut microbes host numerous biosynthetic gene 
clusters (BGCs) that biosynthesize natural products and impact the host's 
physiology. Historically, our understanding of BGCs in mammalian gut microbes 
was largely based on studies on cultured isolates; however, only a small 
fraction of mammal-associated microbes have been investigated. The biochemical 
diversity of the mammalian gut microbiota is poorly understood. Metagenomic 
sequencing contains data from a vast number of organisms and provides 
information on the total gene content of communities. Unfortunately, the 
existing BGC prediction tools are designed for individual microbial genomes. 
Recently, a BGC prediction tool called the taxonomy-guided identification of 
biosynthetic gene clusters (TaxiBGC) that directly mine the metagenome was 
developed. To gain new insights into the microbial metabolism, we used TaxiBGC 
to predict BGCs from 373 metagenomes across 53 mammalian species representing 
seven orders. Our findings elucidate the functional activities of complex 
microbial communities in the gut.

Vast shotgun metagenomics data remain an underutilized resource for novel 
enzymes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been applied to protein 
mining, but its conventional performance evaluation is interpolative in nature, 
and these trained models often struggle to extrapolate effectively when 
challenged with unknown data. In this study, we present a framework (DeepMineLys 
[deep mining of phage lysins from human microbiome]) based on the convolutional 
neural network (CNN) to identify phage lysins from three human microbiome 
datasets. When validated with an independent dataset, our method achieved an 
F1-score of 84.00%, surpassing existing methods by 20.84%. We expressed 16 lysin 
candidates from the top 100 sequences in E. coli, confirming 11 as active. The 
best one displayed an activity 6.2-fold that of lysozyme derived from hen egg 
white, establishing it as the most potent lysin from the human microbiome. Our 
study also underscores several important issues when applying AI to biology 
questions. This framework should be applicable for mining other proteins.

Sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) play a key role in sulfur cycling in mine 
tailings impoundment (TI) waters, where sulfur concentrations are typically 
high. However, our understanding of SOB sulfur cycling via potential S oxidation 
pathways (sox, rdsr, and S4I) in these globally ubiquitous contexts, remains 
limited. Here, we identified TI water column SOB community composition, 
metagenomics derived metabolic repertoires, physicochemistry, and aqueous sulfur 
concentration and speciation in four Canadian base metal mine, 
circumneutral-alkaline TIs over four years (2016 - 2019). Identification and 
examination of genomes from nine SOB genera occurring in these TI waters 
revealed two pH partitioned, metabolically distinct groups, which differentially 
influenced acid generation and sulfur speciation. Complete sox (csox) dominant 
SOB (e.g., Halothiobacillus spp., Thiomonas spp.) drove acidity generation and 
S2O3 2- consumption via the csox pathway at lower pH (pH ~5 to ~6.5). At 
circumneutral pH conditions (pH ~6.5 to ~8.5), the presence of non-csox dominant 
SOB (hosting the incomplete sox, rdsr, and/or other S oxidation reactions; e.g. 
Thiobacillus spp., Sulfuriferula spp.) were associated with higher [S2O3 2-] and 
limited acidity generation. The S4I pathway part 1 (tsdA; S2O3 2- to S4O6 2-), 
was not constrained by pH, while S4I pathway part 2 (S4O6 2- disproportionation 
via tetH) was limited to Thiobacillus spp. and thus circumneutral pH values. 
Comparative analysis of low, natural (e.g., hydrothermal vents and sulfur hot 
springs) and high (e.g., Zn, Cu, Pb/Zn, and Ni tailings) sulfur systems 
literature data with these TI results, reveals a distinct TI SOB mining 
microbiome, characterized by elevated abundances of csox dominant SOB, likely 
sustained by continuous replenishment of sulfur species through tailings or 
mining impacted water additions. Our results indicate that under the primarily 
oxic conditions in these systems, S2O3 2- availability plays a key role in 
determining the dominant sulfur oxidation pathways and associated geochemical 
and physicochemical outcomes, highlighting the potential for biological 
management of mining impacted waters via pH and [S2O3 2-] manipulation.

The study aimed to mine and characterize novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
from the Shanxi aged vinegar microbiome. Utilizing machine learning techniques, 
AlphaFold2 structure prediction and molecular dynamics simulations, six novel 
AMPs were innovatively mined from 98,539 peptides based on metagenomic data, of 
which one peptide secreted by Lactobacillus (named La-AMP) was experimentally 
validated to have remarkable bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus 
(S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) with high stability and no hemolytic 
activity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that La-AMP caused irreversible 
damage to cell membranes of S. aureus and E. coli, a finding further confirmed 
by calcein-AM/propidium iodide staining. Additionally, La-AMP induced nucleic 
acid leakage and reactive oxygen species accumulation in bacterial cells. It was 
found to bind to DNA gyrase through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and 
hydrophobic interactions, ultimately inducing apoptosis. Thus, La-AMP exhibited 
encouraging promise as a valuable bioactive component for the development of 
natural preservatives.

Dose-intensive cytostatic therapy and antibiotic treatment in allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) cause severe abnormalities 
in a composition of gut microbiota as well as the emergence of antibiotic 
resistance. The data on the longitudinal recovery of major bacterial phyla and 
the expansion of genes associated with antibiotic resistance are limited. We 
collected regular stool samples during the first year after allo-HSCT from 12 
adult patients with oncohematological disorders after allo-HSCT and performed 
16SrRNA sequencing, multiplex PCR, conventional bacteriology and CHROMagar 
testing. We observed a decline in Shannon microbiota diversity index as early as 
day 0 of allo-HSCT (p = 0.034) before any administration of antibiotics, which 
persisted up to 1 year after transplantation, when the Shannon index returned to 
pre-transplant levels (p = 0.91). The study confirmed the previously shown 
decline in Bacillota (Firmicutes) genera and the expansion of E. coli/Shigella, 
Klebsiella and Enterococci. The recovery of Firmicutes was slower than that of 
other phyla and occurred only a year post-transplant. A positive correlation was 
observed between the expansion of E. coli/Shigella genera and blaKPC, blaCTX-M-1 
and blaTEM (p < 0.001), Klebsiella spp. and blaOXA-48-like, blaNDM, blaCTX-M-1, 
blaTEM, and blaSHV (p < 0.001), Pseudomonas spp. and blaNDM (p = 0.002), 
Enterococcus spp. and blaOXA-48-like, blaNDM, blaCTX-M-1, blaSHV (p < 0.01). The 
correlation was observed between the expansion of Enterobacterales and and 
carbapenemase-positive CHROMagar samples (p < 0.001). Samples positive for 
carbapenem-resitant bacteria were at their maximum levels on day +30, and were 
gradually diminishing one year after allo-HSCT. From day +30 to +60, all 
isolated K. pneumoniae strains in fecal samples proved to be resistant to the 
main antibiotic groups (carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, 
third-generation cephalosporins). One year after HSCT, we documented the 
spontaneous decolonization of K. pneumoniae. The sensitivity of molecular 
biology techniques in the search for total and antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella 
seems to be superior to common bacteriological cultures. Future studies should 
be focused on searching for novel approaches to the efficient reconstitution 
and/or maintenance of strictly anaerobic microbiota in oncological patients.

INTRODUCTION: Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the 
intricate pathways by which gastrointestinal microbiota and their metabolites 
exert influence on the processes of bone formation. Nonetheless, a notable gap 
exists in the literature concerning a bibliometric analysis of research trends 
at the nexus of gastrointestinal microbiota and bone metabolism.
METHODS: To address this scholarly void, the present study employs a suite of 
bibliometric tools including online platforms, CiteSpace and VOSviewer to 
scrutinize the pertinent literature in the realm of gastrointestinal microbiota 
and bone metabolism.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Examination of the temporal distribution of publications 
spanning from 2000 to 2023 reveals a discernible upward trajectory in research 
output, characterized by an average annual growth rate of 19.2%. Notably, China 
and the United States emerge as primary contributors. Predominant among 
contributing institutions are Emory University, Harvard University, and the 
University of California. Pacifici R from Emory University contributed the most 
research with 15 publications. In the realm of academic journals, Nutrients 
emerges as the foremost publisher, followed closely by Frontiers in Microbiology 
and PLOS One. And PLOS One attains the highest average citations of 32.48. 
Analysis of highly cited papers underscores a burgeoning interest in the 
therapeutic potential of probiotics or probiotic blends in modulating bone 
metabolism by augmenting host immune responses. Notably, significant research 
attention has coalesced around the therapeutic interventions of probiotics, 
particularly Lactobacillus reuteri, in osteoporosis, as well as the role of 
gastrointestinal microbiota in the etiology and progression of osteoarthritis. 
Keyword analysis reveals prevalent terms including gut microbiota, osteoporosis, 
bone density, probiotics, inflammation, SCFAs, metabolism, osteoarthritis, 
calcium absorption, obesity, double-blind, prebiotics, mechanisms, 
postmenopausal women, supplementation, risk factors, oxidative stress, and 
immune system. Future research endeavors warrant a nuanced exploration of topics 
such as inflammation, obesity, SCFAs, postmenopausal osteoporosis, skeletal 
muscle, oxidative stress, double-blind trials, and pathogenic mechanisms. In 
summary, this study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of global 
research on the interplay between gastrointestinal microbiota and bone 
metabolism, offering valuable insights for scholars, particularly nascent 
researchers, embarking on analogous investigations within this domain.

Hyperuricemia is prevalent globally and potentially linked to environmental 
pollution. As a typical persistent organic pollutant, phenanthrene (Phe) poses 
threats to human health through biomagnification. Although studies have reported 
Phe-induced toxicities to multiple organs, its impact on uric acid (UA) 
metabolism remains unclear. In this study, data mining on NHANES 2001-2016 
indicated a positive correlation between Phe exposure and the occurrence of 
hyperuricemia in population. Subsequently, adolescent Balb/c male mice were 
orally exposed to Phe at a dosage of 10 mg/kg bw every second day for 7 weeks, 
resulting in dysfunction of intestinal UA excretion and disruption of the 
intestinal barrier. Utilizing intestinal organoids, 16S rRNA sequencing of gut 
microbiota, and targeted metabolomic analysis, we further revealed that an 
imbalance in bile acid metabolism derived from gut microbiota might mediate the 
intestinal barrier damage. Additionally, the tea extract theabrownin (TB) 
effectively improved Phe-induced hyperuricemia and intestinal dysfunction at a 
dose of 320 mg/kg bw per day. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Phe 
exposure is positively associated with hyperuricemia and intestinal damage, 
which provides new insights into the toxic effects induced by Phe. Furthermore, 
the present study proposes that supplementation with TB would be a healthy and 
effective improvement strategy for patients with hyperuricemia and intestinal 
injury caused by environmental factors.

The present study investigated the indigenous metal-tolerant bacterial 
populations in the mine-water microbiome. Our intention was to assess the 
effects of the metal concentrations in mine water on the bacterial community of 
mine waters. The bacterial communities in Vanadium and Gold mine-water samples 
were exposed to different heavy-metal Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Nickel, 
Mercury and Vanadium at two different concentrations (5 and 25 mM). The 16S rRNA 
amplicon from mine waters were sequenced using the Illumina's NGS MiSeq 
platform. Data analysis revealed a high diversity in the bacterial populations 
associated with the different heavy metals at different concentrations. The 
taxonomic profiles obtained after the exposure were different in different 
salts, but mostly dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, 
Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes at variable relative abundance. Principal 
Component Analysis (PCoA) predicts the clear community shift after exposure with 
heavy metals salts and emergence of tolerant community depending upon the 
specific community present in the original mine water.

Gills and gut are the two primary osmoregulatory organs in fish. Recently, 
studies have expanded beyond the osmoregulatory mechanisms of these organs to 
explore the microbiota communities inhabiting them. It is now known that 
microbial communities in both organs shift in response to osmotic stress. 
However, there are limited studies identifying the major contributors and 
co-occurrence among these microbiota in both organs under seawater and 
freshwater transfer conditions. The current data mining report performed a 
bioinformatics analysis on two previous published datasets from our group, 
aiming to provide insights into host-bacteria relationships under osmotic 
stress. We divided the samples into four groups: control seawater gills (LSW); 
control seawater gut (TSW); freshwater transfer gills (LFW); and freshwater 
transfer gut (TFW). Our results showed that LSW had higher diversities, 
richness, and evenness compared to TSW. However, both the LFW and LSW did not 
show any significant differences after the freshwater transfer experiment. We 
further applied co-occurrence network analysis and, for the first time, reported 
on the interactions of taxa shaping the community structure in these two organs. 
Moreover, we identified enriched ectoine biosynthesis in seawater samples, 
suggesting its potential role in seawater environments. Increased mRNA 
expression levels of Na+/K+-atpase, and cftr, were observed in gills after 6 h 
of ectoine treatment. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on 
host-bacteria interactions under osmotic stress.

statistically significant but biologically unvalidated candidates. To address 
these challenges, we introduce BiOFI, a strategic framework for identifying 
metabolome-microbiome correlation pairs (Bi-Omics). BiOFI employs a 
comprehensive scoring system, incorporating intergroup differences, effects on 
feature correlation networks, and organism abundance. Meanwhile, it establishes 
a built-in database of metabolite-microbe-KEGG functional pathway linking 
relationships. Furthermore, BiOFI can rank related feature pairs by combining 
importance scores and correlation strength. Validation on a dataset of 
cesarean-section infants confirms the strategy's validity and interpretability.

The goal of the study was to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota 
during the advancement of gastric cancer (GC) and identify pertinent taxa 
associated with the disease. We used a public fecal amplicon gastric cancer 
dataset from the Sequence Retrieval Archive (SRA), of patients with GC, 
gastritis, and healthy individuals. We did sequence pre-processing, including 
quality filtering of the sequences. Then, we performed a diversity analysis, 
evaluating α- and β-diversity. Next, taxonomic composition analysis was 
performed and the relative abundances of different taxa at the phylum and genus 
levels were compared between GC, gastritis, and healthy controls. The obtained 
results were subsequently subjected to statistical validation. To conclude, 
metagenomic function prediction was carried out, followed by correlation 
analysis between the microbiota and KEGG pathways. α analysis revealed a 
significant difference between male and female categories, while β analysis 
demonstrated significant distinctions between GC, gastritis, and healthy 
controls, as well as between sexes within the GC and gastritis groups. The 
statistically confirmed taxonomic composition analysis highlighted the presence 
of the microbes Bacteroides and Veillonella. Furthermore, through metagenomic 
prediction analysis and correlation analysis with pathways, three taxa, namely 
Akkermansia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Veillonella, were identified as potential 
biomarkers for GC. Additionally, this study reports, for the first time, the 
presence of two bacteria, Desulfobacteriota and Synergistota, in GC, 
necessitating further investigation. Overall, this research sheds light on the 
potential involvement of gut microbiota in GC pathophysiology; however, 
additional studies are warranted to explore its functional significance.

How to resolve the metabolic dark matter of microorganisms has long been a 
challenging problem in discovering active molecules. Diverse omics tools have 
been developed to guide the discovery and characterization of various microbial 
metabolites, which make it gradually possible to predict the overall metabolites 
for individual strains. The combinations of multi-omic analysis tools 
effectively compensates for the shortcomings of current studies that focus only 
on single omics or a broad class of metabolites. In this review, we 
systematically update, categorize and sort out different analysis tools for 
microbial metabolites prediction in the last five years to appeal for the 
multi-omic combination on the understanding of the metabolic nature of microbes. 
First, we provide the general survey on different updated prediction databases, 
webservers, or software that based on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics, respectively. Then, we discuss the essentiality on the integration 
of multi-omics data to predict metabolites of different microbial strains and 
communities, as well as stressing the combination of other techniques, such as 
systems biology methods and data-driven algorithms. Finally, we identify key 
challenges and trends in developing multi-omic analysis tools for more 
comprehensive prediction on diverse microbial metabolites that contribute to 
human health and disease treatment.

Comprehensive whole-body models (WBMs) accounting for organ-specific dynamics 
have been developed to simulate adult metabolism, but such models do not exist 
for infants. Here, we present a resource of 360 organ-resolved, sex-specific 
models of newborn and infant metabolism (infant-WBMs) spanning the first 
180 days of life. These infant-WBMs were parameterized to represent the distinct 
metabolic characteristics of newborns and infants, including nutrition, energy 
requirements, and thermoregulation. We demonstrate that the predicted infant 
growth was consistent with the recommendation by the World Health Organization. 
We assessed the infant-WBMs' reliability and capabilities for personalization by 
simulating 10,000 newborns based on their blood metabolome and birth weight. 
Furthermore, the infant-WBMs accurately predicted changes in known biomarkers 
over time and metabolic responses to treatment strategies for inherited 
metabolic diseases. The infant-WBM resource holds promise for personalized 
medicine, as the infant-WBMs could be a first step to digital metabolic twins 
for newborn and infant metabolism.

Despite mounting evidence of their importance in human health and ecosystem 
functioning, the definition and measurement of 'healthy microbiomes' remain 
unclear. More advanced knowledge exists on health associations for compounds 
used or produced by microbes. Environmental microbiome exposures (especially via 
soils) also help shape, and may supplement, the functional capacity of human 
microbiomes. Given the synchronous interaction between microbes, their 
feedstocks, and micro-environments, with functional genes facilitating chemical 
transformations, our objective was to examine microbiomes in terms of their 
capacity to process compounds relevant to human health. Here we integrate 
functional genomics and biochemistry frameworks to derive new quantitative 
measures of in silico potential for human gut and environmental soil metagenomes 
to process a panel of major compound classes (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates) and 
selected biomolecules (e.g., vitamins, short-chain fatty acids) linked to human 
health. Metagenome functional potential profile data were translated into a 
universal compound mapping 'landscape' based on bioenergetic van Krevelen 
mapping of function-level meta-compounds and corresponding functional relative 
abundances, reflecting imprinted genetic capacity of microbiomes to metabolize 
an array of different compounds. We show that measures of 'compound processing 
potential' associated with human health and disease (examining atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and 
anxious-depressive behavior case studies), and displayed seemingly predictable 
shifts along gradients of ecological disturbance in plant-soil ecosystems (three 
case studies). Ecosystem quality explained 60-92 % of variation in soil 
metagenome compound processing potential measures in a post-mining restoration 
case study dataset. With growing knowledge of the varying proficiency of 
environmental microbiota to process human health associated compounds, we might 
design environmental interventions or nature prescriptions to modulate our 
exposures, thereby advancing microbiota-oriented approaches to human health. 
Compound processing potential offers a simplified, integrative approach for 
applying metagenomics in ongoing efforts to understand and quantify the role of 
microbiota in environmental- and human-health.

The oxidation of sulfide-bearing mine tailings catalyzed by acidophilic iron and 
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria releases toxic metals and other contaminants into soil 
and groundwater as acid mine drainage. Understanding the environmental variables 
that control the community structure and metabolic activity of microbes 
indigenous to tailings (especially the abiotic stressors of low pH and high 
dissolved metal content) is crucial to developing sustainable bioremediation 
strategies. We determined the microbial community composition along two 
continuous vertical gradients of Cu/Ni mine tailings at each of two tailings 
impoundments near Sudbury, Ontario. 16S rRNA amplicon data showed high 
variability in community diversity and composition between locations, as well as 
at different depths within each location. A temporal comparison for one tailings 
location showed low fluctuation in microbial communities across 2 years. 
Differences in community composition correlated most strongly with pore-water 
pH, Eh, alkalinity, salinity, and the concentration of several dissolved metals 
(including iron, but not copper or nickel). The relative abundances of 
individual genera differed in their degrees of correlation with geochemical 
factors. Several abundant lineages present at these locations have not 
previously been associated with mine tailings environments, including novel 
species predicted to be involved in iron and sulfur cycling.IMPORTANCEMine 
tailings represent a significant threat to North American freshwater, with 
legacy tailings areas generating acid mine drainage (AMD) that contaminates 
rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Microbial activity accelerates AMD formation 
through oxidative metabolic processes but may also ameliorate acidic tailings by 
promoting secondary mineral precipitation and immobilizing dissolved metals. 
Tailings exhibit high geochemical variation within and between mine sites and 
may harbor many novel extremophiles adapted to high concentrations of toxic 
metals. Characterizing the unique microbiomes associated with tailing 
environments is key to identifying consortia that may be used as the foundation 
for innovative mine-waste bioremediation strategies. We provide an in-depth 
analysis of microbial diversity at four copper/nickel mine tailings 
impoundments, describe how communities (and individual lineages) differ based on 
geochemical gradients, predict organisms involved in AMD transformations, and 
identify taxonomically novel groups present that have not previously been 
observed in mine tailings.

The intratumoral microbiota can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME); however, the underlying mechanism by which intratumoral microbiota 
influences the TIME in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) remains 
unclear. To address this, we collected samples from 402 patients with UCB, 
including paired host transcriptome and tumor microbiome data, from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the intratumoral microbiome profiles were 
significantly correlated with the expression pattern of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT)-related genes. Furthermore, we detected that the genera 
Lachnoclostridium and Sutterella in tumors could indirectly promote the EMT 
program by inducing an inflammatory response. Moreover, the inflammatory 
response induced by these two intratumoral bacteria further enhanced 
intratumoral immune infiltration, affecting patient survival and response to 
immunotherapy. In addition, an independent immunotherapy cohort of 348 patients 
with bladder cancer was used to validate our results. Collectively, our study 
elucidates the potential mechanism by which the intratumoral microbiota 
influences the TIME of UCB and provides a new guiding strategy for the targeted 
therapy of UCB.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The intratumoral microbiota may mediate the 
bladder tumor inflammatory response, thereby promoting the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition program and influencing tumor immune 
infiltration.

BACKGROUND: Microbial secondary metabolites play a crucial role in the intricate 
interactions within the natural environment. Among these metabolites, 
ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are 
becoming a promising source of therapeutic agents due to their structural 
diversity and functional versatility. However, their biosynthetic capacity and 
ecological functions remain largely underexplored.
RESULTS: Here, we aim to explore the biosynthetic profile of RiPPs and their 
potential roles in the interactions between microbes and viruses in the ocean, 
which encompasses a vast diversity of unique biomes that are rich in 
interactions and remains chemically underexplored. We first developed TrRiPP to 
identify RiPPs from ocean metagenomes, a deep learning method that detects RiPP 
precursors in a hallmark gene-independent manner to overcome the limitations of 
classic methods in processing highly fragmented metagenomic data. Applying this 
method to metagenomes from the global ocean microbiome, we uncover a diverse 
array of previously uncharacterized putative RiPP families with great novelty 
and diversity. Through correlation analysis based on metatranscriptomic data, we 
observed a high prevalence of antiphage defense-related and phage-related 
protein families that were co-expressed with RiPP families. Based on this 
putative association between RiPPs and phage infection, we constructed an Ocean 
Virus Database (OVD) and established a RiPP-involving host-phage interaction 
network through host prediction and co-expression analysis, revealing complex 
connectivities linking RiPP-encoding prokaryotes, RiPP families, viral protein 
families, and phages. These findings highlight the potential of RiPP families 
involved in prokaryote-phage interactions and coevolution, providing insights 
into their ecological functions in the ocean microbiome.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a systematic investigation of the biosynthetic 
potential of RiPPs from the ocean microbiome at a global scale, shedding light 
on the essential insights into the ecological functions of RiPPs in 
prokaryote-phage interactions through the integration of deep learning 
approaches, metatranscriptomic data, and host-phage connectivity. This study 
serves as a valuable example of exploring the ecological functions of bacterial 
secondary metabolites, particularly their associations with unexplored microbial 
interactions. Video Abstract.

Spillovers of viruses from animals to humans occur more frequently under warmer 
conditions, particularly arboviruses. The invasive tick species Haemaphysalis 
longicornis, the Asian longhorned tick, poses a significant public health threat 
due to its global expansion and its potential to carry a wide range of 
pathogens. We analyzed meta-transcriptomic data from 3595 adult H. longicornis 
ticks collected between 2016 and 2019 in 22 provinces across China encompassing 
diverse ecological conditions. Generalized additive modeling revealed that 
climate factors exerted a stronger influence on the virome of H. longicornis 
than other ecological factors, such as ecotypes, distance to coastline, animal 
host, tick gender, and antiviral immunity. To understand how climate changes 
drive the tick virome, we performed a mechanistic investigation using causality 
inference with emphasis on the significance of this process for public health. 
Our findings demonstrated that higher temperatures and lower relative 
humidity/precipitation contribute to variations in animal host diversity, 
leading to increased diversity of the tick virome, particularly the evenness of 
vertebrate-associated viruses. These findings may explain the evolution of 
tick-borne viruses into generalists across multiple hosts, thereby increasing 
the probability of spillover events involving tick-borne pathogens. Deep 
learning projections have indicated that the diversity of the H. longicornis 
virome is expected to increase in 81.9% of regions under the SSP8.5 scenario 
from 2019 to 2030. Extension of surveillance should be implemented to avert the 
spread of tick-borne diseases.

Lehman Caves is an extensively decorated high desert cave that represents one of 
the main tourist attractions in Great Basin National Park, Nevada. Although 
traditionally considered a water table cave, recent studies identified abundant 
speleogenetic features consistent with a hypogenic and, potentially, sulfuric 
acid origin. Here, we characterized white mineral deposits in the Gypsum Annex 
(GA) passage to determine whether these secondary deposits represent biogenic 
minerals formed during sulfuric acid corrosion and explored microbial 
communities associated with these and other mineral deposits throughout the 
cave. Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), scanning electron microscopy with 
electron dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and electron microprobe analyses 
(EPMA) showed that, while most white mineral deposits from the GA contain 
gypsum, they also contain abundant calcite, silica, and other phases. Gypsum and 
carbonate-associated sulfate isotopic values of these deposits are variable, 
with δ34SV-CDT between +9.7‰ and +26.1‰, and do not reflect depleted values 
typically associated with replacement gypsum formed during sulfuric acid 
speleogenesis. Petrographic observations show that the sulfates likely 
co-precipitated with carbonate and SiO2 phases. Taken together, these data 
suggest that the deposits resulted from later-stage meteoric events and not 
during an initial episode of sulfuric acid speleogenesis. Most sedimentary and 
mineral deposits in Lehman Caves have very low microbial biomass, with the 
exception of select areas along the main tour route that have been impacted by 
tourist traffic. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that 
microbial communities in GA sediments are distinct from those in other parts of 
the cave. The microbial communities that inhabit these oligotrophic secondary 
mineral deposits include OTUs related to known ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosococcales 
and Thaumarchaeota, as well as common soil taxa such as Acidobacteriota and 
Proteobacteria. This study reveals microbial and mineralogical diversity in a 
previously understudied cave and expands our understanding of the 
geomicrobiology of desert hypogene cave systems.

The impact of microbiome in animal physiology is well appreciated, but 
characterization of animal-microbe symbiosis in marine environments remains a 
growing need. This study characterizes the microbial communities associated with 
the moon jellyfish Aurelia coerulea, first isolated from the East Pacific Ocean 
and has since been utilized as an experimental system. We find that the 
microbiome of this Pacific Aurelia culture is dominated by two taxa, a 
Mollicutes and Rickettsiales. The microbiome is stable across life stages, 
although composition varies. Mining the host sequencing data, we assembled the 
bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The bacterial MAGs are highly 
reduced, and predict a high metabolic dependence on the host. Analysis using 
multiple metrics suggest that both bacteria are likely new species. We therefore 
propose the names Ca. Mariplasma lunae (Mollicutes) and Ca. Marinirickettsia 
aquamalans (Rickettsiales). Finally, comparison with studies of Aurelia from 
other geographical populations suggests the association with Ca. Mariplasma 
lunae occurs in Aurelia from multiple geographical locations. The low-diversity 
microbiome of Aurelia provides a relatively simple system to study host-microbe 
interactions.

related to gut microbiota and AD. Based on the Web of Science Core Collection 
SCI-Expanded database, we utilize Excel 2019 and visualization analysis tools 
VOSviewer, Co-Occurrence13.2 (COOC13.2), Citespace, HistCite, and Bibliometrix 
(R-Tool of R-Studio) for analysis. A total of 1093 related kinds of literature 
were included, and the number of papers presented an overall increasing trend. 
The country/region with the most publications is China, the institution is 
Zhejiang University, the author is Walter J Lukiw from the USA, and the journal 
is the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Hotspot research areas include the 
relationship between gut microbiota metabolism and AD, AD treatments related to 
the gut microbiota, and diseases related to AD and gut microbiota. The future 
research direction may be T cells, NLRP3 inflammasome, and Porphyromonas 
gingivalis. Studies on AD and gut microbiota have grown rapidly in recent 
years. Our research results may provide valuable references for readers and help 
researchers better find new research directions in the future.

Microorganisms inhabiting hypersaline environments have received significant 
attention due to their ability to thrive under poly-extreme conditions, 
including high salinity, elevated temperatures and heavy metal stress. They are 
believed to possess biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode secondary 
metabolites as survival strategy and offer potential biotechnological 
applications. In this study, we mined BGCs in shotgun metagenomic sequences 
generated from Lake Afdera, a hypersaline lake in the Afar Depression, Ethiopia. 
The microbiome of Lake Afdera is predominantly bacterial, with Acinetobacter 
(18.6%) and Pseudomonas (11.8%) being ubiquitously detected. A total of 94 
distinct BGCs were identified in the metagenomic data. These BGCs are found to 
encode secondary metabolites with two main categories of functions: (i) 
potential pharmaceutical applications (nonribosomal peptide synthase NRPs, 
polyketide synthase, others) and (ii) miscellaneous roles conferring adaptation 
to extreme environment (bacteriocins, ectoine, others). Notably, NRPs (20.6%) 
and bacteriocins (10.6%) were the most abundant. Furthermore, our metagenomic 
analysis predicted gene clusters that enable microbes to defend against a wide 
range of toxic metals, oxidative stress and osmotic stress. These findings 
suggest that Lake Afdera is a rich biological reservoir, with the predicted BGCs 
playing critical role in the survival and adaptation of extremophiles.

The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical 
importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur-containing amino lipids (SALs) 
involved in biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite 
their physiological relevance and abundance, SALs have only been explored 
through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass 
spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs 
unresolved, hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. 
Herein, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named 
cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and 
degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously 
proposed homotaurine-based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an 
N,O-acylated cysteinolic acid-containing head group carrying various different 
(α-hydroxy)carboxylic acids. We also performed the first validated 
targeted-network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and 
structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering 
structural insight, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical 
data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into 
bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within 
marine environments.

Beneficial bacteria remain largely unexplored. Lacking systematic methods, 
understanding probiotic community traits becomes challenging, leading to various 
conclusions about their probiotic effects among different publications. We 
developed language model-based metaProbiotics to rapidly detect probiotic bins 
from metagenomes, demonstrating superior performance in simulated benchmark 
datasets. Testing on gut metagenomes from probiotic-treated individuals, it 
revealed the probioticity of intervention strains-derived bins and other 
probiotic-associated bins beyond the training data, such as a plasmid-like bin. 
Analyses of these bins revealed various probiotic mechanisms and bai operon as 
probiotic Ruminococcaceae's potential marker. In different health-disease 
cohorts, these bins were more common in healthy individuals, signifying their 
probiotic role, but relevant health predictions based on the abundance profiles 
of these bins faced cross-disease challenges. To better understand the 
heterogeneous nature of probiotics, we used metaProbiotics to construct a 
comprehensive probiotic genome set from global gut metagenomic data. Module 
analysis of this set shows that diseased individuals often lack certain 
probiotic gene modules, with significant variation of the missing modules across 
different diseases. Additionally, different gene modules on the same probiotic 
have heterogeneous effects on various diseases. We thus believe that gene 
function integrity of the probiotic community is more crucial in maintaining gut 
homeostasis than merely increasing specific gene abundance, and adding 
probiotics indiscriminately might not boost health. We expect that the 
innovative language model-based metaProbiotics tool will promote novel probiotic 
discovery using large-scale metagenomic data and facilitate systematic research 
on bacterial probiotic effects. The metaProbiotics program can be freely 
downloaded at https://github.com/zhenchengfang/metaProbiotics.

Peptides have a plethora of activities in biological systems that can 
potentially be exploited biotechnologically. Several peptides are used 
clinically, as well as in industry and agriculture. The increase in available 
'omics data has recently provided a large opportunity for mining novel enzymes, 
biosynthetic gene clusters, and molecules. While these data primarily consist of 
DNA sequences, other types of data provide important complementary information. 
Due to their size, the approaches proven successful at discovering novel 
proteins of canonical size cannot be naïvely applied to the discovery of 
peptides. Peptides can be encoded directly in the genome as short open reading 
frames (smORFs), or they can be derived from larger proteins by proteolysis. 
Both of these peptide classes pose challenges as simple methods for their 
prediction result in large numbers of false positives. Similarly, functional 
annotation of larger proteins, traditionally based on sequence similarity to 
infer orthology and then transferring functions between characterized proteins 
and uncharacterized ones, cannot be applied for short sequences. The use of 
these techniques is much more limited and alternative approaches based on 
machine learning are used instead. Here, we review the limitations of 
traditional methods as well as the alternative methods that have recently been 
developed for discovering novel bioactive peptides with a focus on prokaryotic 
genomes and metagenomes.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are indispensable biotechnology facilities 
for modern cities and play an essential role in modern urban infrastructure by 
employing microorganisms to remove pollutants in wastewater, thus protecting 
public health and the environment. This study conducted a 13-month bacterial 
community survey of six full-scale WWTPs in Hong Kong with samples of influent, 
activated sludge (AS), and effluent to explore their synchronism and 
asynchronism of bacterial community. Besides, we compared AS results of six Hong 
Kong WWTPs with data from 1,186 AS amplicon data in 269 global WWTPs and a 
9-year metagenomic sequencing survey of a Hong Kong WWTP. Our results showed the 
compositions of bacterial communities varied and the bacterial community 
structure of AS had obvious differences across Hong Kong WWTPs. The 
co-occurrence analysis identified 40 pairs of relationships that existed among 
Hong Kong WWTPs to show solid associations between two species and stochastic 
processes took large proportions for the bacterial community assembly of six 
WWTPs. The abundance and distribution of the functional bacteria in worldwide 
and Hong Kong WWTPs were examined and compared, and we found that 
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria had more diversity than nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. 
Besides, Hong Kong WWTPs could make great contributions to the genome mining of 
microbial dark matter in the global "wanted list." Operational parameters had 
important effects on OTUs' abundance, such as the temperature to the genera of 
Tetrasphaera, Gordonia and Nitrospira. All these results obtained from this 
study can deepen our understanding of the microbial ecology in WWTPs and provide 
foundations for further studies.
IMPORTANCE: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an indispensable component 
of modern cities, as they can remove pollutants in wastewater to prevent 
anthropogenic activities. Activated sludge (AS) is a fundamental wastewater 
treatment process and it harbors a highly complex microbial community that forms 
the main components and contains functional groups. Unveiling "who is there" is 
a long-term goal of the research on AS microbiology. High-throughput sequencing 
provides insights into the inventory diversity of microbial communities to an 
unprecedented level of detail. At present, the analysis of communities in WWTPs 
usually comes from a specific WWTP and lacks comparisons and verification among 
different WWTPs. The wide-scale and long-term sampling project and research in 
this study could help us evaluate the AS community more accurately to find the 
similarities and different results for different WWTPs in Hong Kong and other 
regions of the world.

Histology slide, tissue microbes, and the host gene expression can be 
independent prognostic factors of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying 
associations and biological significance of these multimodal omics remain 
unknown. Here, we comprehensively profiled the matched pathological images, 
intratumoral microbes, and host gene expression characteristics in 527 patients 
with CRC. By clustering these patients based on histology slide features, we 
classified the patients into two histology slide subtypes (HSS). Onco-microbial 
community and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) were also significantly 
different between the two subtypes (HSS1 and HSS2) of patients. Furthermore, 
variation in intratumoral microbes-host interaction was associated with the 
prognostic heterogeneity between HSS1 and HSS2. This study proposes a new CRC 
classification based on pathological image features and elucidates the process 
by which tumor microbes-host interactions are reflected in pathological images 
through the TIME.

BACKGROUND: Microbial functioning on marine plastic surfaces has been poorly 
documented, especially within cold climates where temperature likely impacts 
microbial activity and the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms. To 
date, only two studies have used metaproteomics to unravel microbial 
genotype-phenotype linkages in the marine 'plastisphere', and these have 
revealed the dominance of photosynthetic microorganisms within warm climates. 
Advancing the functional representation of the marine plastisphere is vital for 
the development of specific databases cataloging the functional diversity of the 
associated microorganisms and their peptide and protein sequences, to fuel 
biotechnological discoveries. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment for 
plastisphere metaproteomics, using multi-omics and data mining on thin plastic 
biofilms to provide unique insights into plastisphere metabolism. Our robust 
experimental design assessed DNA/protein co-extraction and cell lysis 
strategies, proteomics workflows, and diverse protein search databases, to 
resolve the active plastisphere taxa and their expressed functions from an 
understudied cold environment.
RESULTS: For the first time, we demonstrate the predominance and activity of 
hydrocarbonoclastic genera (Psychrobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas) within a 
primarily heterotrophic plastisphere. Correspondingly, oxidative 
phosphorylation, the citrate cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism were the 
dominant pathways expressed. Quorum sensing and toxin-associated proteins of 
Streptomyces were indicative of inter-community interactions. Stress response 
proteins expressed by Psychrobacter, Planococcus, and Pseudoalteromonas and 
proteins mediating xenobiotics degradation in Psychrobacter and 
Pseudoalteromonas suggested phenotypic adaptations to the toxic chemical 
microenvironment of the plastisphere. Interestingly, a targeted search strategy 
identified plastic biodegradation enzymes, including polyamidase, hydrolase, and 
depolymerase, expressed by rare taxa. The expression of virulence factors and 
mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance suggested pathogenic genera were active, 
despite representing a minor component of the plastisphere community.
CONCLUSION: Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the functioning 
of the marine plastisphere, contributing new insights into the function and 
ecology of an emerging and important microbial niche. Our comprehensive 
multi-omics and comparative metaproteomics experimental design enhances 
biological interpretations to provide new perspectives on microorganisms of 
potential biotechnological significance beyond biodegradation and to improve the 
assessment of the risks associated with microorganisms colonizing marine plastic 
pollution. Video Abstract.

Intratumoral microbiota can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 
and mediate tumor prognosis by promoting inflammatory response or inhibiting 
anti-tumor effects. Recent studies have elucidated the potential role of local 
tumor microbiota in the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD). However, whether intratumoral microbes are involved in the TIME that 
mediates the prognosis of LUAD remains unknown. Here, we obtained the matched 
tumor microbiome and host transcriptome and survival data of 478 patients with 
LUAD in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Machine learning models based on immune 
cell marker genes can predict 1- to 5-year survival with relative accuracy. 
Patients were stratified into high- and low-survival-risk groups based on immune 
cell marker genes, with significant differences in intratumoral microbial 
communities. Specifically, patients in the high-risk group had significantly 
higher alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and were characterized by an enrichment of 
lung cancer-related genera such as Streptococcus. However, network analysis 
highlighted a more active pattern of dominant bacteria and immune cell crosstalk 
in TIME in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Our study 
demonstrated that intratumoral microbiota-immune crosstalk was strongly 
associated with prognosis in LUAD patients, which would provide new targets for 
the development of precise therapeutic strategies.

Bacteriolytic myxobacteria are versatile micropredators and are proposed as 
potential biocontrol agents against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens. 
Isolation of new myxobacteria species and exploration of effective predatory 
products are necessary for successful biocontrol of pathogens. In this study, a 
myxobacterium strain CY-1 was isolated from a soil sample of a pig farm using 
the Escherichia coli baiting method. Based on the morphological observation, 
physiological test, 16S rRNA gene sequence, and genomic data, strain CY-1 was 
identified as a novel species of the myxobacterial genus Archangium, for which 
the name Archangium lipolyticum sp. nov. was proposed. Subsequent predation 
tests indicated that the strain efficiently lysed drug-resistant pathogens, with 
a higher predatory activity against E. coli 64 than Staphylococcus aureus GDMCC 
1.771 (MRSA). The lysis of extracellular proteins against ester-bond-containing 
substrates (tributyrin, tween 80, egg-yolk, and autoclaved drug-resistant 
pathogens) inspired the mining of secreted predatory products with lipolytic 
activity. Furthermore, a lipase ArEstA was identified from the genome of CY-1, 
and the heterologously expressed and purified enzyme showed bacteriolytic 
activity against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli 64 but not against Gram-positive 
MRSA, possibly due to different accessibility of enzyme to lipid substrates in 
different preys. Our research not only provided a novel myxobacterium species 
and a candidate enzyme for the development of new biocontrol agents but also 
reported an experimental basis for further study on different mechanisms of 
secreted predatory products in myxobacterial killing and degrading of 
Gram-negative and Gram-positive preys.

Till present, natural wetlands have been continuously subjected to intensive 
pollution stress in recent years, mainly because of the rapidly growing 
industrialization and urbanization that are associated with a myriad of 
anthropogenic activities and land use practices. These man-made sources of 
pollution change the chemical properties of the natural wetlands, which in turn 
alter their microbial ecological biodiversity and functions. For the first time, 
the impact of the current anthropogenic activities and land use practices on the 
Blesbokspruit wetland chemical status and their consequential effect on the 
microbial structure and functions were investigated. Sites of high pollution 
intensity were identified using geographic information systems mapping 
(GISMapping) and the wetland microbiome and functional profile were studied 
through the use of high throughput shotgun metagenomics sequencing analysis. The 
predominant phyla that stemmed along the Blesbokspruit wetland were found to be 
Proteobacteria which was more dominant in water (93 %) than in the sediments 
(89 %), followed by firmicutes which was more abundant in sediments (9 %) than 
in water (6 %), and Bacteroidetes were relatively low in abundance within both 
the sediments (2 %) and the overlying water (1 %). The genera Klebsiella 
(70.4 %-28.2 %), Citrobacter (52.0 %-30.6 %), Escherichia (51.0 %-8.4 %), and 
Lynsinibacillus (9.3 %-1.5 %) were observed in most water and sediment samples. 
Within the six polluted sites, Site 2 was found to be the most highly polluted 
site in the Blesbokspruit wetland with very high COD (900 mg/L), TOC 
(11.60 mg/L), NO3- (39.74 mg/L), NO2- (12.64 mg/L), PO43 (4.14 mg/L), Fl- 
(143.88 mg/L), Cl- (145.95 mg/L) concentrations recorded in the water and high 
levels of TOC (0.37 mg/L), TC (6.92 %), TN (1.82 %), TS (0.53 %) in sediments. 
The microbial community structure and functions were found to be strongly 
influenced by the high organic content from the intense agricultural activities 
and sewage spillages and heavy metals from the mining activities nearby.

BACKGROUND: Base Mine Lake (BML) is the first full-scale end pit lake for the 
oil sands mining industry in Canada. BML sequesters oil sands tailings under a 
freshwater cap and is intended to develop into a functional ecosystem that can 
be integrated into the local watershed. The first stage of successful 
reclamation requires the development of a phytoplankton community supporting a 
typical boreal lake food web. To assess the diversity and dynamics of the 
phytoplankton community in BML at this reclamation stage and to set a baseline 
for future monitoring, we examined the phytoplankton community in BML from 2016 
through 2021 using molecular methods (targeting the 23S, 18S, and 16S rRNA 
genes) and microscopic methods. Nearby water bodies were used as controls for a 
freshwater environment and an active tailings pond.
RESULTS: The phytoplankton community was made up of diverse bacteria and 
eukaryotes typical of a boreal lake. Microscopy and molecular data both 
identified a phytoplankton community comparable at the phylum level to that of 
natural boreal lakes, dominated by Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Cyanophyta, 
with some Bacillariophyta, Ochrophyta, and Euglenophyta. Although many of the 
same genera were prominent in both BML and the control freshwater reservoir, 
there were differences at the species or ASV level. Total diversity in BML was 
also consistently lower than the control freshwater site, but consistently 
higher than the control tailings pond. The phytoplankton community composition 
in BML changed over the 5-year study period. Some taxa present in 2016-2019 
(e.g., Choricystis) were no longer detected in 2021, while some dinophytes and 
haptophytes became detectable in small quantities starting in 2019-2021. 
Different quantification methods (qPCR analysis of 23S rRNA genes, and 
microscopic estimates of populations and total biomass) did not show a 
consistent directional trend in total phytoplankton over the 5-year study, nor 
was there any consistent increase in phytoplankton species diversity. The 5-year 
period was likely an insufficient time frame for detecting community trends, as 
phytoplankton communities are highly variable at the genus and species level.
CONCLUSIONS: BML supports a phytoplankton community composition somewhat unique 
from control sites (active tailings and freshwater lake) and is still changing 
over time. However, the most abundant genera are typical of natural boreal lakes 
and have the potential to support a complex aquatic food web, with many of its 
identified major phytoplankton constituents known to be primary producers in 
boreal lake environments.

Plants and their associated microbes live in complicated, changeable, and 
unpredictable environments. They usually interact with each other in many ways 
through multidimensional, multiscale, and multilevel coupling manners, leading 
to challenges in the coexistence of randomness and determinism or continuity and 
discreteness. Gaining a deeper understanding of these diverse interaction 
mechanisms can facilitate the development of data-mining theories and methods 
for complex systems, coupled modeling for systems with different spatiotemporal 
scales and functional properties, or even a universal theory of information and 
information interactions. In this study, we use a "closed-loop" model to present 
a plant-microbe interaction system and describe the probable functions of 
microbial natural products. Specifically, we report a rhizosphere species, 
Streptomyces ginsengnesis G7, which produces polyketide lydicamycins and other 
active metabolites. Interestingly, these distinct molecules have the potential 
to function both as antibiotics and as herbicides for crop protection. Detailed 
laboratory experiments conducted in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), combined 
with a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, allow us to rationalize a model 
for this specific plant-microbe interaction process. Our work reveals the 
benefits of exploring otherwise neglected resources for the identification of 
potential functional molecules and provides a reference to better understand the 
system biology of complex ecosystems.

The 190 kb megaplasmid pMP7017 of Bifidobacterium breve JCM7017 represents the 
first conjugative and largest plasmid characterised within this genus to date. 
In the current study, we adopted an integrated approach combining 
transcriptomics, whole genome comparative analysis and metagenomic data mining 
to understand the biology of pMP7017 and related megaplasmids, and to assess the 
impact of plasmid-carriage on the host strain. The data generated revealed 
variations within basic features of promoter elements which correlate with a 
high level of transcription on the plasmid and highlight the transcriptional 
activity of genes encoding both offensive and defensive adaptations, including a 
Type IIL restriction-modification system, an anti-restriction system and four 
Type II toxin-antitoxin systems. Furthermore, a highly transcribed tmRNA, which 
likely provides translational support to the host strain, was identified, making 
pMP7017 the first plasmid of the Bifidobacterium genus and the smallest plasmid 
known to express a tmRNA. Analyses of synteny and variability among pMP7017 and 
related plasmids indicate substantial diversity in gene organisation and 
accessory gene cargo highlighting diverse (co-)evolution and potential 
host-specific rearrangements and adaptations. Systematic analysis of the codon 
usage profile of transcriptionally active pMP7017-encoded genes suggests that 
pMP7017 originated from (sub)species of Bifidobacterium longum. Furthermore, 
mining of metagenomic data suggests the presence of pMP7017-homologues in ~10% 
of microbiome samples, mostly infants and/or mothers from various geographical 
locations. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the B. breve UCC2003 chromosome 
in the presence or absence of pMP7017 revealed differential expression of genes 
representing 8% of the total gene pool. Genes involved in genetic information 
processing were exclusively upregulated, while altered expression of genes 
involved in biofilm production and polysaccharide biosynthesis was also 
observed.

BACKGROUND: The healthy as well as dysbiotic state of an ecosystem like human 
body is known to be influenced not only by the presence of the bacterial groups 
in it, but also with respect to the associations within themselves. Evidence 
reported in biomedical text serves as a reliable source for identifying and 
ascertaining such inter bacterial associations. However, the complexity of the 
reported text as well as the ever-increasing volume of information necessitates 
development of methods for automated and accurate extraction of such knowledge.
METHODS: A BioBERT (biomedical domain specific language model) based information 
extraction model for bacterial associations is presented that utilizes learning 
patterns from other publicly available datasets. Additionally, a specialized 
sentence corpus has been developed to significantly improve the prediction 
accuracy of the 'transfer learned' model using a fine-tuning approach.
RESULTS: The final model was seen to outperform all other variations 
(non-transfer learned and non-fine-tuned models) as well as models trained on 
BioGPT (a domain trained Generative Pre-trained Transformer). To further 
demonstrate the utility, a case study was performed using bacterial association 
network data obtained from experimental studies.
CONCLUSION: This study attempts to demonstrate the applicability of transfer 
learning in a niche field of life sciences where understanding of inter 
bacterial relationships is crucial to obtain meaningful insights in 
comprehending microbial community structures across different ecosystems. The 
study further discusses how such a model can be further improved by fine tuning 
using limited training data. The results presented and the datasets made 
available are expected to be a valuable addition in the field of medical 
informatics and bioinformatics.

To investigate the possibility of phosphorus (P) recovery from marine sediment 
and explore the role of the carbon: nitrogen ratio in affecting the internal P 
release under anaerobic conditions, we experimented with the external addition 
of carbon (acetic acid and glucose) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) to expose P 
release mechanisms. The 24-day anaerobic incubations were conducted with four 
different carbon: nitrogen dosing groups including no NH4-N addition and COD/N 
ratios of 100, 50, and 10. The P release showed that extra NH4-N loading 
significantly suppressed the decomposition of P (p < 0.05) from the marine 
sediment, the maximum P release was 4.07 mg/L and 7.14 mg/L in acetic acid- and 
glucose-fed systems, respectively, without extra NH4-N addition. Additionally, 
the results exhibited that the imbalance of carbon: nitrogen not only failed to 
induce the production of organic P mineralization enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) 
in the sediment but also suppressed its activity under anaerobic conditions. The 
highest enzyme activity was observed in the group without additional NH4-N 
dosage, with rates of 1046.4 mg/(kg∙h) in the acetic acid- and 967.8 mg/(kg∙h) 
in the glucose-fed system, respectively. Microbial data analysis indicated that 
a decrease in the abundance of P release-regulating bacteria, including 
polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (Rhodobacteraceae) and sulfate-reducing 
bacteria (Desulfosarcinaceae), was observed in the high NH4-N addition groups. 
The observed reduction in enzyme activity and suppression of microbial activity 
mentioned above could potentially account for the inhibited P decomposition in 
the presence of high NH4-N addition under anaerobic conditions. The produced 
P-enriched solution from the bioreactors may offer a promising source for future 
recovery endeavors.

MOTIVATION: Up-to-date pathway knowledge is usually presented in scientific 
publications for human reading, making it difficult to utilize these resources 
for semantic integration and computational analysis of biological pathways. We 
here present an approach to mining knowledge graphs by combining manual curation 
with automated named entity recognition and automated relation extraction. This 
approach allows us to study pathway-related questions in detail, which we here 
show using the ketamine pathway, aiming to help improve understanding of the 
role of gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine.
RESULTS: The thus devised ketamine pathway 'KetPath' knowledge graph comprises 
five parts: (i) manually curated pathway facts from images; (ii) recognized 
named entities in biomedical texts; (iii) identified relations between named 
entities; (iv) our previously constructed microbiota and pre-/probiotics 
knowledge bases; and (v) multiple community-accepted public databases. We first 
assessed the performance of automated extraction of relations between named 
entities using the specially designed state-of-the-art tool BioKetBERT. The 
query results show that we can retrieve drug actions, pathway relations, 
co-occurring entities, and their relations. These results uncover several 
biological findings, such as various gut microbes leading to increased 
expression of BDNF, which may contribute to the sustained antidepressant effects 
of ketamine. We envision that the methods and findings from this research will 
aid researchers who wish to integrate and query data and knowledge from multiple 
biomedical databases and literature simultaneously.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Data and query protocols are available in the 
KetPath repository at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8398941 and

INTRODUCTION: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) holds significant promise for 
epidemiological inquiries, as it enables the identification and tracking of 
pathogenic origins and dissemination through comprehensive genome analysis. This 
method is widely preferred for investigating outbreaks and monitoring pathogen 
activity. However, the effective utilization of microbiome sequencing data 
remains a challenge for clinical and public health experts. Through the National 
Pathogen Resource Center, we have constructed a dynamic and interactive online 
analysis platform to facilitate the in-depth analysis and use of pathogen 
genomic data, by public health and associated professionals, to support 
infectious disease surveillance framework building and capacity warnings.
METHOD: The platform was implemented using the Java programming language, and 
the front-end pages were developed using the VUE framework, following the MVC 
(Model-View-Controller) pattern to enable interactive service functionalities 
for front-end data collection and back-end data computation. Cloud computing 
services were employed to integrate biological information analysis tools for 
conducting fundamental analysis on sequencing data.
RESULT: The platform achieved the goal of non-programming analysis, providing an 
interactive visual interface that allows users to visually obtain results by 
setting parameters in web pages. Moreover, the platform allows users to export 
results in various formats to further support their research.
DISCUSSION: We have established a dynamic and interactive online platform for 
bioinformatics analysis. By encapsulating the complex background experiments and 
analysis processes in a cloud-based service platform, the complex background 
experiments and analysis processes are presented to the end-user in a simple and 
interactive manner. It facilitates real-time data mining and analysis by 
allowing users to independently select parameters and generate analysis results 
at the click of a button, based on their needs, without the need for a 
programming foundation.

BACKGROUND: Cancer screening and early detection greatly increase the chances of 
successful treatment. However, most cancer types lack effective early screening 
biomarkers. In recent years, natural language processing (NLP)-based text-mining 
methods have proven effective in searching the scientific literature and 
identifying promising associations between potential biomarkers and disease, but 
unfortunately few are widely used.
METHODS: In this study, we used an NLP-enabled text-mining system, MarkerGenie, 
to identify potential stool bacterial markers for early detection and screening 
of colorectal cancer. After filtering markers based on text-mining results, we 
validated bacterial markers using multiplex digital droplet polymerase chain 
reaction (ddPCR). Classifiers were built based on ddPCR results, and 
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate 
the performance.
RESULTS: A total of 7 of the 14 bacterial markers showed significantly increased 
abundance in the stools of colorectal cancer patients. A five-bacteria 
classifier for colorectal cancer diagnosis was built, and achieved an AUC of 
0.852, with a sensitivity of 0.692 and specificity of 0.935. When combined with 
the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), our classifier achieved an AUC of 0.959 and 
increased the sensitivity of FIT (0.929 vs. 0.872) at a specificity of 0.900.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a valuable case example of the use of NLP-based 
marker mining for biomarker identification.

PURPOSE: To determine the prevalent microbiological profile of biliary atresia 
(BA) patients at the time of its occurrence by studying their intestinal flora.
METHODS: A total of 118 gut microbiota samples from three groups of 43 BA 
patients, 33 disease controls (DC) with other cholestatic diseases and 42 
healthy controls (HC), were analyzed by deep mining of public data. 
Subsequently, a total of 23 fecal samples from three groups of clinically 
collected patients (11 BA, 6 DC and 6 HC) were sequenced for 16S rRNA gene 
amplification and analyzed for serum butyrate (BU) level by liquid 
chromatography.
RESULTS: Taxonomic analysis revealed significant differences in the composition 
of the intestinal microbiota between BA patients and controls, with a reduction 
in diversity and a higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Streptococcus and 
Lactobacillus in the BA group. Database and clinical data analyses concluded 
that Streptococcus/Bacteroides (AUC = 0.9035, 95% CI 0.8347-0.9722, P < 0.0001) 
or Streptococcus/Eggerthella (AUC = 0.8333, 95% CI 0.6340-1.000, P = 0.027) was 
the best microbiota to differentiate between BA and DC. Serum butyrate levels 
were low in the BA and DC groups and differed from the HC group (P = 0.01, 
P = 0.04). Butyrate levels in BA were negatively correlated with jaundice 
clearance and cholangitis, but not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals changes in the composition of the gut microbiota 
in BA, especially the butyrate-producing microbiota, and suggests the potential 
for using gut microbiota as a noninvasive diagnostic benefit for BA. Low levels 
of serum butyrate in BA may indicate a poor prognosis.

Transposons, plasmids, bacteriophages, and other mobile genetic elements 
facilitate horizontal gene transfer in the gut microbiota, allowing some 
pathogenic bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Currently, 
the relationship between specific ARGs and specific transposons in the 
comprehensive infant gut microbiome has not been elucidated. In this study, ARGs 
and transposons were annotated from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome 
(UHGG) and the Early-Life Gut Genomes (ELGG). Association rules mining was used 
to explore the association between specific ARGs and specific transposons in 
UHGG, and the robustness of the association rules was validated using the 
external database in ELGG. Our results suggested that ARGs and transposons were 
more likely to be relevant in infant gut microbiota compared to adult gut 
microbiota, and nine robust association rules were identified, among which 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter hormaechei_A, and Escherichia coli_D played 
important roles in this association phenomenon. The emphasis of this study is to 
investigate the synergistic transfer of specific ARGs and specific transposons 
in the infant gut microbiota, which can contribute to the study of microbial 
pathogenesis and the ARG dissemination dynamics.IMPORTANCEThe transfer of 
transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among microorganisms 
accelerates antibiotic resistance dissemination among infant gut microbiota. 
Nonetheless, it is unclear what the relationship between specific ARGs and 
specific transposons within the infant gut microbiota. K. pneumoniae, E. 
hormaechei_A, and E. coli_D were identified as key players in the nine robust 
association rules we discovered. Meanwhile, we found that infant gut 
microorganisms were more susceptible to horizontal gene transfer events about 
specific ARGs and specific transposons than adult gut microorganisms. These 
discoveries could enhance the understanding of microbial pathogenesis and the 
ARG dissemination dynamics within the infant gut microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for the treatment of 
chronic liver diseases for a long time, with proven safety and efficacy in 
clinical settings. Previous studies suggest that the therapeutic mechanism of 
TCM for hepatitis B cirrhosis may involve the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the 
causal relationship between the gut microbiota, which is closely linked to TCM, 
and cirrhosis remains unknown. This study aims to utilize two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal relationship between gut 
microbes and cirrhosis, as well as to elucidate the synergistic mechanisms 
between botanical drugs and microbiota in treating cirrhosis.
METHODS: Eight databases were systematically searched through May 2022 to 
identify clinical studies on TCM for hepatitis B cirrhosis. We analyzed the 
frequency, properties, flavors, and meridians of Chinese medicinals based on TCM 
theories and utilized the Apriori algorithm to identify the core botanical drugs 
for cirrhosis treatment. Cross-database comparison elucidated gut microbes 
sharing therapeutic targets with these core botanical drugs. MR analysis 
assessed consistency between gut microbiota causally implicated in cirrhosis and 
microbiota sharing therapeutic targets with key botanicals.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed differences between the Chinese medicinals used 
for compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, with distinct frequency, dosage, 
properties, flavors, and meridian based on TCM theory. Angelicae Sinensis Radix, 
Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma, Poria, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Astragali 
Radix, Atrctylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma were the main botanicals. Botanical 
drugs and gut microbiota target MAPK1, VEGFA, STAT3, AKT1, RELA, JUN, and ESR1 
in the treatment of hepatitis B cirrhosis, and their combined use has shown 
promise for cirrhosis treatment. MR analysis demonstrated a positive correlation 
between increased ClostridialesvadinBB60 and Ruminococcustorques abundance and 
heightened cirrhosis risk. In contrast, Eubacteriumruminantium, Lachnospiraceae, 
Eubacteriumnodatum, RuminococcaceaeNK4A214, Veillonella, and 
RuminococcaceaeUCG002 associated with reduced cirrhosis risk. Notably, 
Lachnospiraceae shares key therapeutic targets with core botanicals, which can 
treat cirrhosis at a causal level.
CONCLUSION: We identified 6 core botanical drugs for managing compensated and 
decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis, despite slight prescription differences. 
The core botanical drugs affected cirrhosis through multiple targets and 
pathways. The shared biological effects between botanicals and protective gut 
microbiota offer a potential explanation for the therapeutic benefits of these 
key herbal components in treating cirrhosis. Elucidating these mechanisms 
provides crucial insights to inform new drug development and optimize clinical 
therapy for hepatitis B cirrhosis.

Recently, the gut microbiota-based live biotherapeutics (LBPs) development, the 
interaction between gut microbial species and the host, and the mining of new 
antimicrobial peptides, enzymes and metabolic pathway have received increasing 
attention. Culturing gut microbial species is therefore of great importance. 
This review systemically compared the construction advances of gut microbial 
culture banks and also analyzed the differences of methods used by research 
groups to give insight into the construction and enrichment of gut microbial 
resources. Presently, the gut microbial culture banks have included more than 1 
000 bacterial species, belonging to 12 phyla, 22 classes, 39 orders, 96 
families, and 358 genera. Among these, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, 
and Actinomycetota exhibited the greatest diversities at the species level. The 
sequencing data showed that there are more than 2 000 species inhibited in the 
human gut. Therefore, the cultured gut microbial species are far from 
saturation. In terms of the construction method, the stool samples were 
pre-treated with ethanol or directly spread and cultured in the non-selective 
nutritional rich medium (represented by Gifu anaerobic medium) to obtain single 
colony. Then single colony was further purified. Generally, a simplified 
isolation and culture method is sufficient to obtain the most common and 
important intestinal bacterial species, such as Bifidobacteria-Lactobacillus, 
Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella and S24-7 
family strains. Finally, microbial resources with great diversities at the 
strain level are required for further functional research and product 
development. Samples covering hosts with distinct physiological status, diets or 
regions are necessary.

The advent of next-generation sequencing has greatly accelerated the field of 
human microbiome studies. Currently, investigators are seeking, struggling and 
competing to find new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent human diseases through 
the human microbiome. Machine learning is a promising approach to help such an 
effort, especially due to the high complexity of microbiome data. However, many 
of the current machine learning algorithms are in a "black box", i.e., they are 
difficult to understand and interpret. In addition, clinicians, public health 
practitioners and biologists are not usually skilled at computer programming, 
and they do not always have high-end computing devices. Thus, in this study, we 
introduce a unified web cloud analytic platform, named MiTree, for user-friendly 
and interpretable microbiome data mining. MiTree employs tree-based learning 
methods, including decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting, that are 
well understood and suited to human microbiome studies. We also stress that 
MiTree can address both classification and regression problems through 
covariate-adjusted or unadjusted analysis. MiTree should serve as an easy-to-use 
and interpretable data mining tool for microbiome-based disease prediction 
modeling, and should provide new insights into microbiome-based diagnostics, 
treatment and prevention. MiTree is an open-source software that is available on 
our web server.

The origin of eukaryotic cells, and especially naturally occurring syncytial 
cells, remains debatable. While a majority of our biomedical research focuses on 
the eukaryotic result of evolution, our data remain limiting on the prokaryotic 
precursors of these cells. This is particularly evident when considering 
extremophile biology, especially in how the genomes of organisms in extreme 
environments must have evolved and adapted to unique habitats. Might these 
rapidly diversifying organisms have created new genetic tools eventually used to 
enhance the evolution of the eukaryotic single nuclear or syncytial cells? Many 
organisms are capable of surviving, or even thriving, in conditions of extreme 
temperature, acidity, organic composition, and then rapidly adapt to yet new 
conditions. This study identified organisms found in extremes of salinity. A 
lake and a nearby pond in the Ethiopian Rift Valley were interrogated for life 
by sequencing the DNA of populations of organism collected from the water in 
these sites. Remarkably, a vast diversity of microbes were identified, and even 
though the two sites were nearby each other, the populations of organisms were 
distinctly different. Since these microbes are capable of living in what for 
humans would be inhospitable conditions, the DNA sequences identified should 
inform the next step in these investigations; what new gene families, or 
modifications to common genes, do these organisms employ to survive in these 
extreme conditions. The relationship between organisms and their environment can 
be revealed by decoding genomes of organisms living in extreme environments. 
These genomes disclose new biological mechanisms that enable life outside 
moderate environmental conditions, new gene functions for application in 
biotechnology, and may even result in identification of new species. In this 
study, we have collected samples from two hypersaline sites in the Danakil 
depression, the shorelines of Lake As'ale and an actively mixing salt pond 
called Muda'ara (MUP), to identify the microbial community by metagenomics. 
Shotgun sequencing was applied to high density sampling, and the relative 
abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) was calculated. Despite the 
broad taxonomic similarities among the salt-saturated metagenomes analyzed, MUP 
stood out from Lake As'ale samples. In each sample site, Archaea accounted for 
95% of the total OTUs, largely to the class Halobacteria. The remaining 5% of 
organisms were eubacteria, with an unclassified strain of Salinibacter ruber as 
the dominant OTU in both the Lake and the Pond. More than 40 different genes 
coding for stress proteins were identified in the three sample sites of Lake 
As'ale, and more than 50% of the predicted stress-related genes were associated 
with oxidative stress response proteins. Chaperone proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, 
and ClpB) were predicted, with percentage of query coverage and similarities 
ranging between 9.5% and 99.2%. Long reads for ClpB homologous protein from Lake 
As'ale metagenome datasets were modeled, and compact 3D structures were 
generated. Considering the extreme environmental conditions of the Danakil 
depression, this metagenomics dataset can add and complement other studies on 
unique gene functions on stress response mechanisms of thriving bio-communities 
that could have contributed to cellular changes leading to single and/or 
multinucleated eukaryotic cells.

BACKGROUND: The Amazon Region hosts invaluable and unique biodiversity as well 
as mineral resources. Consequently, large illegal and artisanal gold mining 
areas exist in indigenous territories. Mercury has been used in gold mining, and 
some has been released into the environment and atmosphere, primarily affecting 
indigenous people such as the Yanomami. In addition, other heavy metals have 
been associated with gold mining and other metal-dispersing activities in the 
region.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the gut microbiome of two semi-isolated groups from the 
Amazon, focusing on metal resistance.
METHODS: Metagenomic data from the Yanomami and Tunapuco gut microbiome were 
assembled into contigs, and their putative proteins were searched against a 
database of metal resistance proteins.
FINDINGS: Proteins associated with mercury resistance were exclusive in the 
Yanomami, while proteins associated with silver resistance were exclusive in the 
Tunapuco. Both groups share 77 non-redundant metal resistance (MR) proteins, 
mostly associated with multi-MR and operons with potential resistance to 
arsenic, nickel, zinc, copper, copper/silver, and cobalt/nickel. Although both 
groups harbour operons related to copper resistance, only the Tunapuco group had 
the pco operon.
CONCLUSION: The Yanomami and Tunapuco gut microbiome shows that these people 
have been exposed directly or indirectly to distinct scenarios concerning heavy 
metals.

The associations between cancer and bacteria/fungi have been extensively 
studied, but the implications of cancer-associated viruses have not been 
thoroughly examined. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the cancer 
virome of tissue samples across 31 cancer types, as well as blood samples from 
23 cancer types. Our findings demonstrated the presence of viral DNA at low 
abundances in both tissue and blood across major human cancers, with significant 
differences in viral community composition observed among various cancer types. 
Furthermore, Cox regression analyses conducted on four cancers, including Head 
and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 
(KIRC), Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma 
(UCEC), revealed strong correlation between viral composition/abundance in 
tissues and patient survival. Additionally, we identified virus-associated 
prognostic signatures (VAPS) for these four cancers, and discerned differences 
in the interplay between VAPS and dominant bacteria in tissues among patients 
with varying survival risks. Notably, clinically relevant analyses revealed 
prognostic capacities of the VAPS in these four cancers. Taken together, our 
study provides novel insights into the role of viruses in tissue in the 
prognosis of multiple cancers and offers guidance on the use of tissue viruses 
to stratify prognosis for patients with cancer.

ICEberg 3.0 (https://tool2-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg3/) is an upgraded database 
that provides comprehensive insights into bacterial integrative and conjugative 
elements (ICEs). In comparison to the previous version, three key enhancements 
were introduced: First, through text mining and manual curation, it now 
encompasses details of 2065 ICEs, 607 IMEs and 275 CIMEs, including 430 with 
experimental support. Secondly, ICEberg 3.0 systematically categorizes cargo 
gene functions of ICEs into six groups based on literature curation and 
predictive analysis, providing a profound understanding of ICEs'diverse 
biological traits. The cargo gene prediction pipeline is integrated into the 
online tool ICEfinder 2.0. Finally, ICEberg 3.0 aids the analysis and 
exploration of ICEs from the human microbiome. Extracted and manually curated 
from 2405 distinct human microbiome samples, the database comprises 1386 
putative ICEs, offering insights into the complex dynamics of Bacteria-ICE-Cargo 
networks within the human microbiome. With the recent updates, ICEberg 3.0 
enhances its capability to unravel the intricacies of ICE biology, particularly 
in the characterization and understanding of cargo gene functions and ICE 
interactions within the microbiome. This enhancement may facilitate the 
investigation of the dynamic landscape of ICE biology and its implications for 
microbial communities.

BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and 
evaluating their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are laborious tasks that involve 
in vitro cultivation, isolation, and susceptibility testing. Recently, a number 
of methods have been developed that use machine learning algorithms applied to 
the whole-genome sequencing data of isolates to approach this problem. However, 
making AMR assessments from more easily available metagenomic sequencing data 
remains a big challenge.
RESULTS: We present the Metagenomic Sequencing to Antimicrobial Resistance 
(MGS2AMR) pipeline, which detects antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and their 
possible organism of origin within a sequenced metagenomics sample. This in 
silico method allows for the evaluation of bacterial AMR directly from clinical 
specimens, such as stool samples. We have developed two new algorithms to 
optimize and annotate the genomic assembly paths within the raw Graphical 
Fragment Assembly (GFA): the GFA Linear Optimal Path through seed segments 
(GLOPS) algorithm and the Adapted Dijkstra Algorithm for GFA (ADAG). These novel 
algorithms improve the sensitivity of ARG detection and aid in species 
annotation. Tests based on 1200 microbiome samples show a high ARG recall rate 
and correct assignment of the ARG origin. The MGS2AMR output can further be used 
in many downstream applications, such as evaluating AMR to specific antibiotics 
in samples from emerging intestinal infections. We demonstrate that the 
MGS2AMR-derived data is as informative for the entailing prediction models as 
the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. The performance of these models is on 
par with our previously published method (WGS2AMR), which is based on the

CONCLUSIONS: MGS2AMR can provide researchers with valuable insights into the AMR 
content of microbiome environments and may potentially improve patient care by 
providing faster quantification of resistance against specific antibiotics, 
thereby reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The presented pipeline 
also has potential applications in other metagenome analyses focused on the 
defined sets of genes. Video Abstract.

Numerous studies have shown that different subtypes of breast cancer (BC) have 
significant differences in terms of the tumor microbiome, host gene expression, 
and histopathological image, whereas the biological links between these 
cancer-associated indicators are still unknown. Here, we performed a 
comprehensive analysis with 610 patients of the four subtypes of BC with matched 
tissue microbiota, host transcriptome, and histopathological image samples. 
Correlation analysis showed that the composition of intratumoral viruses shaped 
the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients with BC, and the TME was further 
reflected in the histopathological images. Of the four subtypes, patients with 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) had unique intratumoral viral community 
composition, non-cancer cell infiltration in the TME, and histopathological 
image characteristics. Furthermore, we detected multiple virus-cell-image 
association axes in TNBC, in which tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have 
clinical prognostic implication. This study provides a comprehensive map of the 
associations between the intratumoral virome, TME, and histopathological image 
of TNBC, as well as insights into disease prognosis that can be crucial for 
precise therapeutic intervention strategies.

Aims: The study aimed to provide a bibliometric and visual analysis of research 
on abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel disease and discuss the current status, 
research hotspots, and future developments. Methods: We used the Web of Science 
Core Collection to comprehensively search the literature on abdominal 
pain-related research in IBD published between 2003 and 2022. The bibliometric 
and visual analysis was performed through CiteSpace, VOSviewer software, R 
language, and the bibliometric online analysis platform, including authors, 
institutions, countries, journals, references, and keywords in the literature. 
Results: A total of 3,503 relevant articles are included, indicating that the 
number of articles in this field has increased in recent years. The United 
States leads the way with a dominant position in terms of article output, 
followed by China and JAPAN. United States (967 articles), University of Calgary 
(98 articles), and World Journal of Gastroenterology (127 articles) are the top 
publishing countries, institutions, and journals, respectively; keyword analysis 
shows that gut microbiota, depression, stress, visceral hypersensitivity, and 
multidisciplinary approach are the hot spots and trends in this research area. 
Conclusion: Abdominal pain-related studies in IBD have received increasing 
attention in the past two decades. This study provides the first bibliometric 
analysis of papers in this research area using visualization software and data 
information mining. It provides insights into this field's current status, hot 
spots, and trends. However, many outstanding issues in this research area still 
need further exploration to provide a theoretical basis for its clinical 
application.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota play important roles in host adaptation and 
evolution, but are understudied in natural population of wild mammals. To 
address host adaptive evolution and improve conservation efforts of threatened 
mammals from a metagenomic perspective, we established a high-quality gut 
microbiome catalog of the giant panda (pandaGUT) to resolve the microbiome 
diversity, functional, and resistome landscapes using approximately 7 Tbp of 
long- and short-read sequencing data from 439 stool samples.
RESULTS: The pandaGUT catalog comprises 820 metagenome-assembled genomes, 
including 40 complete closed genomes, and 64.5% of which belong to species that 
have not been previously reported, greatly expanding the coverage of most 
prokaryotic lineages. The catalog contains 2.37 million unique genes, with 74.8% 
possessing complete open read frames, facilitating future mining of microbial 
functional potential. We identified three microbial enterotypes across wild and 
captive panda populations characterized by Clostridium, Pseudomonas, and 
Escherichia, respectively. We found that wild pandas exhibited host 
genetic-specific microbial structures and functions, suggesting host-gut 
microbiota phylosymbiosis, while the captive cohorts encoded more multi-drug 
resistance genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides largely untapped resources for biochemical and 
biotechnological applications as well as potential intervention avenues via the 
rational manipulation of microbial diversity and reducing antibiotic usage for 
future conservation management of wildlife. Video Abstract.

The possible adverse effect of consuming bovine milk with A1 β-casein (but not 
with A2 β-casein) on health aspects due to the release of β-casomorphin-7 
(BCM-7) is currently under debate. The aim of this study was to perform a 
bibliometric analysis of studies extracted from Scopus to explore the 
relationship between BCM-7, A1 or A2 bovine milk with different aspects of 
health. Over time, several research groups were formed that are no longer active 
and although some authors have returned to the field of study, they have focused 
their efforts mainly on conducting reviews that show the same imprecise 
conclusions due to the few original articles. Research is concentrated in Europe 
and Asia, where New Zealand, China and Germany are the countries with the most 
publications, records and citations on the subject, respectively. On the other 
hand, no country in Africa or South America has scientific production, which 
opens the possibility of building collaborations between countries and exploring 
areas that lack scientific studies. Based on conflicting information from 
primarily in vitro and animal studies, and limited clinical trials with poor 
designs, A1 milk presents pro-inflammatory and oxidative activity, but the 
evidence is insufficient to associate its consumption with negative health 
effects. However, A2 milk may be better tolerated by the digestive system of 
some individuals, suggesting its possible modulating role in the intestinal 
microbiota. Stronger scientific evidence is needed to reach a consensus on 
whether the presence of β-casein A1 can significantly negatively affect health. 
The information shown will allow a better understanding of the subject and 
consumers will be able to make their own decisions regarding A1 or A2 milk.

Single cell sequencing is useful for resolving complex systems into their 
composite cell types and computationally mining them for unique features that 
are masked in pooled sequencing. However, while commercial instruments have made 
single cell analysis widespread for mammalian cells, analogous tools for 
microbes are limited. Here, we present EASi-seq (Easily Accessible Single 
microbe sequencing). By adapting the single cell workflow of the commercial 
Mission Bio Tapestri instrument, this method allows for efficient sequencing of 
individual microbes' genomes. EASi-seq allows thousands of microbes to be 
sequenced per run and, as we show, can generate detailed atlases of human and 
environmental microbiomes. The ability to capture large shotgun genome datasets 
from thousands of single microbes provides new opportunities in discovering and 
analyzing species subpopulations. To facilitate this, we develop a companion 
bioinformatic pipeline that clusters microbes by similarity, improving whole 
genome assembly, strain identification, taxonomic classification, and gene 
annotation. In addition, we demonstrate integration of metagenomic contigs with 
the EASi-seq datasets to reduce capture bias and increase coverage. Overall, 
EASi-seq enables high quality single cell genomic data for microbiome samples 
using an accessible workflow that can be run on a commercially available 
platform.

This study reports the virome investigation of pollinator species and other 
floral visitors associated with plants from the south of Bahia: Aphis aurantii, 
Atrichopogon sp., Dasyhelea sp., Forcipomyia taiwana, and Trigona ventralis 
hoozana. Studying viruses in insects associated with economically important 
crops is vital to understand transmission dynamics and manage viral diseases 
that pose as threats for global food security. Using literature mining and 
public RNA next-generation sequencing data deposited in the NCBI SRA database, 
we identified potential vectors associated with Malvaceae plant species and 
characterized the microbial communities resident in these insects. Bacteria and 
Eukarya dominated the metagenomic analyses of all taxon groups. We also found 
sequences showing similarity to elements from several viral families, including 
Bunyavirales, Chuviridae, Iflaviridae, Narnaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, 
Rhabdoviridae, Totiviridae, and Xinmoviridae. Phylogenetic analyses indicated 
the existence of at least 16 new viruses distributed among A. aurantii (3), 
Atrichopogon sp. (4), Dasyhelea sp. (3), and F. taiwana (6). No novel viruses 
were found for T. ventralis hoozana. For F. taiwana, the available libraries 
also allowed us to suggest possible vertical transmission, while for A. aurantii 
we followed the infection profile along the insect development. Our results 
highlight the importance of studying the virome of insect species associated 
with crop pollination, as they may play a crucial role in the transmission of 
viruses to economically important plants, such as those of the genus Theobroma, 
or they will reduce the pollination process. This information may be valuable in 
developing strategies to mitigate the spread of viruses and protect the global 
industry.

Coal gangue is a solid waste emitted during coal production. Coal gangue is 
deployed adjacent to mining land and has characteristics similar to those of the 
soils of these areas. Coal gangue-soil ecosystems provide habitats for a rich 
and active bacterial community. However, co-existence networks and the 
functionality of soil and coal gangue bacterial communities have not been 
studied. Here, we performed Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, symbiotic 
network and statistical analyses, and microbial phenotype prediction to study 
the microbial community in coal gangue and soil samples from Shanxi Province, 
China. In general, the structural difference between the bacterial communities 
in coal gangue and soil was large, indicating that interactions between soil and 
coal gangue are limited but not absent. The bacterial community exhibited a 
significant symbiosis network in soil and coal gangue. The co-occurrence network 
was primarily formed by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. In 
addition, BugBase microbiome phenotype predictions and PICRUSt bacterial 
functional potential predictions showed that transcription regulators 
represented the highest functional category of symbiotic bacteria in soil and 
coal gangue. Proteobacteria played an important role in various processes such 
as mobile element pathogenicity, oxidative stress tolerance, and biofilm 
formation. In general, this work provides a theoretical basis and data support 
for the in situ remediation of acidified coal gangue hills based on 
microbiological methods.

The Duluth Complex (DC) contains sulfide-rich magmatic intrusions that represent 
one of the largest known economic deposits of copper, nickel, and platinum group 
elements. Previous work showed that microbial communities associated with 
experimentally-weathered DC waste rock and tailings were dominated by 
uncultivated taxa and organisms not typically associated with mine waste. 
However, those experiments were designed for kinetic testing and do not 
necessarily represent the conditions expected for long-term environmental 
weathering. We used 16S rRNA gene methods to characterize the microbial 
communities present on the surfaces of naturally-weathered and historically 
disturbed outcrops of DC material. Rock surfaces were dominated by diverse 
uncultured Ktedonobacteria, Acetobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with abundant 
algae and other phototrophs. These communities were distinct from microbial 
assemblages from experimentally-weathered DC rocks, suggesting different energy 
and nutrient resources in environmental samples. Sulfide mineral incubations 
performed with and without algae showed that photosynthetic microorganisms could 
have an inhibitory effect on autotrophic populations, resulting in slightly 
lower sulfate release and differences in dominant microorganisms. The microbial 
assemblages from these weathered outcrops show how communities develop during 
weathering of sulfide-rich DC rocks and represent baseline data that could 
evaluate the effectiveness of future reclamation of waste produced by 
large-scale mining operations.

Anaerobic digestion of municipal mixed sludge produces methane that can be 
converted into renewable natural gas. To improve economics of this microbial 
mediated process, metabolic interactions catalyzing biomass conversion to energy 
need to be identified. Here, we present a two-year time series associating 
microbial metabolism and physicochemistry in a full-scale wastewater treatment 
plant. By creating a co-occurrence network with thousands of time-resolved 
microbial populations from over 100 samples spanning four operating 
configurations, known and novel microbial consortia with potential to drive 
methane production were identified. Interactions between these populations were 
further resolved in relation to specific process configurations by mapping 
metagenome assembled genomes and cognate gene expression data onto the network. 
Prominent interactions included transcriptionally active Methanolinea 
methanogens and syntrophic benzoate oxidizing Syntrophorhabdus, as well as a 
Methanoregulaceae population and putative syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria 
affiliated with Bateroidetes (Tenuifilaceae) expressing the glycine cleavage 
bypass of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.

Co-cultivation is an effective method of inducing the production of specialized 
metabolites (SMs) in microbial strains. By mimicking the ecological interactions 
that take place in natural environment, this approach enables to trigger the 
biosynthesis of molecules which are not formed under monoculture conditions. 
Importantly, microbial co-cultivation may lead to the discovery of novel 
chemical entities of pharmaceutical interest. The experimental efforts aimed at 
the induction of SMs are greatly facilitated by computational techniques. The 
aim of this overview is to highlight the relevance of computational methods for 
the investigation of SM induction via microbial co-cultivation. The concepts 
related to the induction of SMs in microbial co-cultures are briefly introduced 
by addressing four areas associated with the SM induction workflows, namely the 
detection of SMs formed exclusively under co-culture conditions, the annotation 
of induced SMs, the identification of SM producer strains, and the optimization 
of fermentation conditions. The computational infrastructure associated with 
these areas, including the tools of multivariate data analysis, molecular 
networking, genome mining and mathematical optimization, is discussed in 
relation to the experimental results described in recent literature. The 
perspective on the future developments in the field, mainly in relation to the 
microbiome-related research, is also provided.

Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is a model plant pathogen that infects 
tomatoes and Arabidopsis thaliana. The current understanding of global 
transcriptional regulation in the pathogen is limited. Here, we applied iModulon 
analysis to a compendium of RNA-seq data to unravel its transcriptional 
regulatory network. We characterize each co-regulated gene set, revealing the 
activity of major regulators across diverse conditions. We provide new insights 
on the transcriptional dynamics in interactions with the plant immune system and 
with other bacterial species, such as AlgU-dependent regulation of flagellar 
genes during plant infection and downregulation of siderophore production in the

Background. Local recurrence and distant metastasis are the main causes of death 
in patients with cancer. Only considering species abundance changes when 
identifying markers of recurrence and metastasis in patients hinders finding 
solutions.Hypothesis. Consideration of microbial abundance changes and microbial 
interactions facilitates the identification of microbial markers of tumour 
recurrence and metastasis.Aim. This study aims to simultaneously consider 
microbial abundance changes and microbial interactions to identify microbial 
markers of recurrence and metastasis in multiple cancer types.Method. One 
thousand one hundred and six non-RM (patients without recurrence and metastasis 
within 3 years after initial surgery) tissue samples and 912 RM (patients with 
recurrence or metastasis within 3 years after initial surgery) tissue samples 
representing 11 cancer types were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA).Results. Tumour tissue bacterial composition differed significantly among 
11 cancers. Among them, the tissue microbiome of four cancers, head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), stomach 
adenocarcinoma (STAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), showed 
relatively good performance in predicting recurrence and metastasis in patients, 
with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.78, 
0.74, 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. Considering both species abundance changes 
and microbial interactions for the four cancers, a combination of nine genera 
(Niastella, Schlesneria, Thioalkalivibrio, Phaeobacter, Sphaerotilus, Thiomonas, 
Lawsonia, Actinobacillus and Spiroplasma) performed best in predicting patient 
survival.Conclusion. Taken together, our results imply that comprehensive 
consideration of microbial abundance changes and microbial interactions is 
helpful for mining bacterial markers that carry prognostic information.

PJ, Abate AR.

Single cell sequencing is useful for resolving complex systems into their 
composite cell types and computationally mining them for unique features that 
are masked in pooled sequencing. However, while commercial instruments have made 
single cell analysis widespread for mammalian cells, analogous tools for 
microbes are limited. Here, we present EASi-seq (Easily Accessible Single 
microbe sequencing). By adapting the single cell workflow of the commercial 
Mission Bio Tapestri instrument, this method allows for efficient sequencing of 
individual microbes' genomes. EASi-seq allows thousands of microbes to be 
sequenced per run and, as we show, can generate detailed atlases of human and 
environmental microbiomes. The ability to capture large shotgun genome datasets 
from thousands of single microbes provides new opportunities in discovering and 
analyzing species subpopulations. To facilitate this, we develop a companion 
bioinformatic pipeline that clusters microbes by similarity, improving whole 
genome assembly, strain identification, taxonomic classification, and gene 
annotation. In addition, we demonstrate integration of metagenomic contigs with 
the EASi-seq datasets to reduce capture bias and increase coverage. Overall, 
EASi-seq enables high quality single cell genomic data for microbiome samples 
using an accessible workflow that can be run on a commercially available 
platform.

Elevated lead (Pb) has been widely observed in mangrove sediments due to human 
activities, yet understanding the sources of Pb in these sediments and the 
factors influencing Pb accumulation is challenging. Here, we combined Pb 
isotopes with partial extraction methods to study Pb contamination levels in 
mangrove sediments from the eastern and western parts of the Maowei Sea, China. 
Our results showed that the Pb in the leachate and residual fraction was mainly 
from anthropogenic and natural sources, respectively. The use of 204Pb isotope 
analysis can reveal some overlooked differences between anthropogenic and 
natural sources. Calculation by Bayesian mixing model showed no significant 
difference in the total anthropogenic contribution between the two sites, but 
the relative contribution of each end member differed. The contribution of Pb/Zn 
ores was much higher in the eastern sites (30.9 ± 5.1%) than in the west 
(18.4 ± 5.5%), while that of agricultural activities was much lower in the east 
(5.2 ± 3.1%) than in the west (13.5 ± 4.6%). The elevated anthropogenic Pb 
accumulation in mangrove sediments was ascribed to organic matter. This study 
provides more data on Pb isotopic composition and new insights into Pb 
biogeochemistry in the mangrove environment.

China is the largest global consumer of antimicrobials and improving 
surveillance methods could help to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread. 
Here we report the surveillance of ten large-scale chicken farms and four 
connected abattoirs in three Chinese provinces over 2.5 years. Using a data 
mining approach based on machine learning, we analysed 461 microbiomes from 
birds, carcasses and environments, identifying 145 potentially mobile antibiotic 
resistance genes (ARGs) shared between chickens and environments across all 
farms. A core set of 233 ARGs and 186 microbial species extracted from the 
chicken gut microbiome correlated with the AMR profiles of Escherichia coli 
colonizing the same gut, including Arcobacter, Acinetobacter and 
Sphingobacterium, clinically relevant for humans, and 38 clinically relevant 
ARGs. Temperature and humidity in the barns were also correlated with ARG 
presence. We reveal an intricate network of correlations between environments, 
microbial communities and AMR, suggesting multiple routes to improving AMR 
surveillance in livestock production.

The Borra caves, the second largest subterranean karst cave ecosystem in the 
Indian sub-continent, are located at the Ananthagiri hills of Araku Valley in 
the Alluri district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The present investigation applied 
a shotgun metagenomic approach to gain insights into the microbial community 
structure, metabolic potential, and biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) diversity of 
the microbes colonizing the surface of the speleothems from the aphotic zone of 
Borra caves. The taxonomic analysis of the metagenome data illustrated that the 
speleothem-colonizing core microbial community was dominated mainly by Alpha-, 
Beta-, and Gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. 
The key energy metabolic pathways analysis provides strong evidence of 
chemolithoautotrophic and chemoheterotrophic modes of nutrition in the 
speleothem-colonizing microbial community. Metagenome data suggests that sulfur 
reducers and sulfur-disproportionating microbes might play a vital role in 
energy generation in this ecosystem. Our metagenome data also suggest that the 
dissimilatory nitrifiers and nitrifying denitrifiers might play an essential 
role in conserving nitrogen pools in the ecosystem. Furthermore, metagenome-wide 
BGCs mining retrieved 451 putative BGCs; NRPS was the most abundant (24%). 
Phylogenetic analysis of the C domain of NRPS showed that sequences were 
distributed across all six function categories of the known C domain, including 
several novel subclades. For example, a novel subclade had been recovered within 
the LCL domain clade as a sister subclade of immunosuppressant cyclosporin 
encoding C domain sequences. Our result suggested that subterranean cave 
microbiomes might be a potential reservoir of novel microbial metabolites.

A growing body of evidence has linked the gut microbiota to liver metabolism. 
The manipulation of intestinal microflora has been considered as a promising 
avenue to promote liver health. However, the effects of Lactobacillus gasseri 
LA39, a potential probiotic, on liver metabolism remain unclear. Accumulating 
studies have investigated the proteomic profile for mining the host biological 
events affected by microbes, and used the germ-free (GF) mouse model to evaluate 
host-microbe interaction. Here, we explored the effects of L. gasseri LA39 
gavage on the protein expression profiles of the liver of GF mice. Our results 
showed that a total of 128 proteins were upregulated, whereas a total of 123 
proteins were downregulated by treatment with L. gasseri LA39. Further 
bioinformatics analyses suggested that the primary bile acid (BA) biosynthesis 
pathway in the liver was activated by L. gasseri LA39. Three differentially 
expressed proteins (cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1 (CYP27A1), 
cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1), and cytochrome P450 
family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1)) involved in the primary BA biosynthesis 
pathway were further validated by western blot assay. In addition, targeted 
metabolomic analyses demonstrated that serum and fecal β‍-muricholic acid (a 
primary BA), dehydrolithocholic acid (a secondary BA), and glycolithocholic 
acid-3-sulfate (a secondary BA) were significantly increased by L. gasseri LA39. 
Thus, our data revealed that L. gasseri LA39 activates the hepatic primary BA 
biosynthesis and promotes the intestinal secondary BA biotransformation. Based 
on these findings, we suggest that L. gasseri LA39 confers an important function 
in the gut‒liver axis through regulating BA metabolism.

越来越多的证据已将肠道微生物与肝脏代谢联系在一起。肠道菌群干预已被视为一条有望促进肝脏健康的途径。然而，格氏乳酸杆菌LA39（一种潜在的益生菌）对肝脏代谢的影响仍不明确。大量的研究已通过分析蛋白组图谱来挖掘受微生物影响的宿主生物学事件，并利用无菌小鼠模型来研究宿主与微生物的互作。在本研究中，我们探讨了格氏乳酸杆菌LA39灌服处理对无菌小鼠肝脏蛋白表达图谱的影响。结果表明，格氏乳酸杆菌LA39可导致128个肝脏蛋白质的表达上调，以及123个肝脏蛋白质的表达下调。进一步的生物信息学分析表明，格氏乳酸杆菌LA39可激活肝脏中初级胆汁酸的生物合成通路。蛋白免疫印迹实验进一步验证了参与初级胆汁酸生物合成通路的三个差异表达蛋白（CYP27A1、CYP7B1和CYP8B1）。此外，靶向代谢组学分析证明了格氏乳酸杆菌LA39可显著增加血清和粪便中的β-鼠胆酸（一种初级胆汁酸）、脱氢石胆酸（一种次级胆汁酸）和甘氨石胆酸-3-硫酸盐（一种次级胆汁酸）的含量。综上所述，格氏乳酸杆菌LA39可激活肝脏中初级胆汁酸的生物合成，并促进肠道中次级胆汁酸的生物转化。这些研究发现暗示了格氏乳酸杆菌LA39通过调控胆汁酸代谢在肠-肝轴中发挥了重要功能。.

Acidic pit lakes represent hydrological features resulting from the accumulation 
of acid mine drainage in mining operations. Long-term monitoring is essential 
for these extreme and contaminated environments, yet tracking investigations 
integrating microbial geochemical dynamics in acidic pit lakes have been lacking 
thus far. This study integrated historical data with field sampling to track 
decadal biogeochemical changes in an acidic pit lake. With limited artificial 
disturbance, significant and sustained biogeochemical changes were observed over 
the past decade. Surface water pH slowly increased from 2.8 to a maximum of 3.6, 
with a corresponding increase in bottom water pH to around 3.9, despite the 
accumulation of externally imported sulfate and metals. Elevated nutrient levels 
stimulated the macroscopic growth of Chlorophyta, resulting in a shift from 
reddish-brown to green water with floating algal bodies. Furthermore, 
microalgae-fixed organic carbon promoted the transition from the initial 
chemolithotrophy-based population dominated by Acidiphilium and Ferrovum to a 
heterotrophic community. The increase in heterotrophic iron- and 
sulfate-reducers may cause an elevation in ferrous levels and a decline in 
copper concentrations. However, most metals were not removed from the water 
column, potentially due to insufficient biosulfidogenesis or sulfide 
reoxidation. These findings offer novel insights into microbial succession in 
extreme ecosystem evolution and contribute to the management and remediation of 
acidic pit lakes.

BACKGROUND: The current study aims to examine association of dietary live 
microbes and nondietary prebiotic/probiotic intake with cognitive function among 
older U.S. adults, examining heterogeneity across demographic characteristics 
and diseases.
METHODS: Participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
2011-2014 cycles were selected and administered 3 cognitive function tests: the 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word Learning subtest 
(CERAD W-L, including immediate [CERAD-IRT] and delayed [CERAD-DRT] memory), the 
Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). 
Test-specific and global cognition z-score was created. Based on their estimated 
dietary live microbes intake, participants were categorized into three groups: 
low, medium, and high. Text mining was employed to identify nondietary 
prebiotic/probiotic usage by examining the names and ingredients of dietary 
supplements or drugs.
RESULTS: Participants in the medium (including AFT) and high (including global 
cognition, AFT, DSST, and CERAD-IRT) dietary live microbes intake group had 
significantly higher z-score of cognitive function compared to those in the low 
intake group. Among participants with cardiovascular disease history, nondietary 
prebiotic intake was associated with higher z-score in global cognition and 
CERAD-DRT compared to those who did not consume prebiotic. Additionally, 
probiotic intake was linked to higher z-score in global cognition, AFT, and 
DSST, particularly in participants with diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the intake of dietary live microbes and 
nondietary probiotic/prebiotic was associated with better cognitive function in 
older adults, particularly in specific disease states.

BACKGROUND: The growing recognition of the microbiome's impact on human health 
and well-being has prompted extensive research into discovering the links 
between microbiome dysbiosis and disease (healthy) states. However, this 
valuable information is scattered in unstructured form within biomedical 
literature. The structured extraction and qualification of microbe-disease 
interactions are important. In parallel, recent advancements in 
deep-learning-based natural language processing algorithms have revolutionized 
language-related tasks such as ours. This study aims to leverage 
state-of-the-art deep-learning language models to extract microbe-disease 
relationships from biomedical literature.
RESULTS: In this study, we first evaluate multiple pre-trained large language 
models within a zero-shot or few-shot learning context. In this setting, the 
models performed poorly out of the box, emphasizing the need for domain-specific 
fine-tuning of these language models. Subsequently, we fine-tune multiple 
language models (specifically, GPT-3, BioGPT, BioMedLM, BERT, BioMegatron,

evaluate their performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the 
state-of-the-art performance of these fine-tuned models ( specifically GPT-3, 
BioMedLM, and BioLinkBERT), achieving an average F1 score, precision, and recall 
of over [Formula: see text] compared to the previous best of  0.74.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study establishes that pre-trained language models 
excel as transfer learners when fine-tuned with domain and problem-specific 
data, enabling them to achieve state-of-the-art results even with limited 
training data for extracting microbiome-disease interactions from scientific 
publications.

Hydrocarbon spills in cold climates are a prominent and enduring form of 
anthropogenic contamination. Bioremediation is one of a suite of remediation 
tools that has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for transforming these 
contaminants in soil, ideally into less harmful products. However, little is 
understood about the molecular mechanisms driving these complex, microbially 
mediated processes. The emergence of -omic technologies has led to a revolution 
within the sphere of environmental microbiology allowing for the identification 
and study of so called 'unculturable' organisms. In the last decade, -omic 
technologies have emerged as a powerful tool in filling this gap in our 
knowledge on the interactions between these organisms and their environment in 
vivo. Here, we utilize the text mining software Vosviewer to process meta-data 
and visualize key trends relating to cold climate bioremediation projects. The 
results of text mining of the literature revealed a shift over time from 
optimizing bioremediation experiments on the macro/community level to, in more 
recent years focusing on individual organisms of interest, interactions within 
the microbiome and the investigation of novel metabolic degradation pathways. 
This shift in research focus was made possible in large part by the rise of 
omics studies allowing research to focus not only what organisms/metabolic 
pathways are present but those which are functional. However, all is not 
harmonious, as the development of downstream analytical methods and associated 
processing tools have outpaced sample preparation methods, especially when 
dealing with the unique challenges posed when analyzing soil-based samples.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes that can help organisms survive in 
hydrothermal vents by hydrating carbon dioxide (CO2). In this study, we focus on 
alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) CAs, which are present in the thermophilic 
microbiome of marine hydrothermal vents. The coding genes of these enzymes can 
be transferred between hydrothermal-vent organisms via horizontal gene transfer 
(HGT), which is an important tool in natural biodiversity. We performed big data 
mining and bioinformatics studies on α-, β-, and γ-CA coding genes from the 
thermophilic microbiome of marine hydrothermal vents. The results showed a 
reasonable association between thermostable α-, β-, and γ-CAs in the microbial 
population of the hydrothermal vents. This relationship could be due to HGT. We 
found evidence of HGT of α- and β-CAs between Cycloclasticus sp., a symbiont of 
Bathymodiolus heckerae, and an endosymbiont of Riftia pachyptila via Integrons. 
Conversely, HGT of β-CA genes from the endosymbiont Tevnia jerichonana to the 
endosymbiont Riftia pachyptila was detected. In addition, Hydrogenovibrio 
crunogenus SP-41 contains a β-CA gene on genomic islands (GIs). This gene can be 
transferred by HGT to Hydrogenovibrio sp. MA2-6, a methanotrophic endosymbiont 
of Bathymodiolus azoricus, and a methanotrophic endosymbiont of Bathymodiolus 
puteoserpentis. The endosymbiont of R. pachyptila has a γ-CA gene in the genome. 
If α- and β-CA coding genes have been derived from other microorganisms, such as 
endosymbionts of T. jerichonana and Cycloclasticus sp. as the endosymbiont of B. 
heckerae, through HGT, the theory of the necessity of thermostable CA enzymes 
for survival in the extreme ecosystem of hydrothermal vents is suggested and 
helps the conservation of microbiome natural diversity in hydrothermal vents. 
These harsh ecosystems, with their integral players, such as HGT and 
endosymbionts, significantly impact the enrichment of life on Earth and the 
carbon cycle in the ocean.

and local neighborhood constraints.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that metabolites are closely related 
to human diseases. Identifying disease-related metabolites is especially 
important for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Previous works have mainly 
focused on the global topological information of metabolite and disease 
similarity networks. However, the local tiny structure of metabolites and 
diseases may have been ignored, leading to insufficiency and inaccuracy in the 
latent metabolite-disease interaction mining.
METHODS: To solve the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel 
metabolite-disease interaction prediction method with logical matrix 
factorization and local nearest neighbor constraints (LMFLNC). First, the 
algorithm constructs metabolite-metabolite and disease-disease similarity 
networks by integrating multi-source heterogeneous microbiome data. Then, the 
local spectral matrices based on these two networks are established and used as 
the input of the model, together with the known metabolite-disease interaction 
network. Finally, the probability of metabolite-disease interaction is 
calculated according to the learned latent representations of metabolites and 
diseases.
RESULTS: Extensive experiments on the metabolite-disease interaction data were 
conducted. The results show that the proposed LMFLNC method outperformed the 
second-best algorithm by 5.28 and 5.61% in the AUPR and F1, respectively. The 
LMFLNC method also exhibited several potential metabolite-disease interactions, 
such as "Cortisol" (HMDB0000063), relating to "21-Hydroxylase deficiency," and 
"3-Hydroxybutyric acid" (HMDB0000011) and "Acetoacetic acid" (HMDB0000060), both 
relating to "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency."
CONCLUSION: The proposed LMFLNC method can well preserve the geometrical 
structure of original data and can thus effectively predict the underlying 
associations between metabolites and diseases. The experimental results show its 
effectiveness in metabolite-disease interaction prediction.

BACKGROUND: Our knowledge about the ecological role of bacterial antimicrobial 
peptides (bacteriocins) in the human gut is limited, particularly in relation to 
their role in the diversification of the gut microbiota during early life. The 
aim of this paper was therefore to address associations between bacteriocins and 
bacterial diversity in the human gut microbiota. To investigate this, we did an 
extensive screening of 2564 healthy human gut metagenomes for the presence of 
predicted bacteriocin-encoding genes, comparing bacteriocin gene presence to 
strain diversity and age.
RESULTS: We found that the abundance of bacteriocin genes was significantly 
higher in infant-like metagenomes (< 2 years) compared to adult-like metagenomes 
(2-107 years). By comparing infant-like metagenomes with and without a given 
bacteriocin, we found that bacteriocin presence was associated with increased 
strain diversities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that bacteriocins may play a role in the 
strain diversification during the infant gut microbiota establishment.

The gut microbial community has been shown to play a significant role in various 
diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), which is a major public health 
concern worldwide. The accurate diagnosis and etiological analysis of CRC are 
crucial issues. Numerous methods have utilized gut microbiota to address these 
challenges; however, few have considered the complex interactions and individual 
heterogeneity of the gut microbiota, which are important issues in genetics and 
intestinal microbiology, particularly in high-dimensional cases. This paper 
presents a novel method called Binary matrix based on Logistic Regression 
(LRBmat) to address these concerns. The binary matrix in LRBmat can directly 
mitigate or eliminate the influence of heterogeneity, while also capturing 
information on gut microbial interactions with any order. LRBmat is highly 
adaptable and can be combined with any machine learning method to enhance its 
capabilities. The proposed method was evaluated using real CRC data and 
demonstrated superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art 
methods. Furthermore, the association rules extracted from the binary matrix of 
the real data align well with biological properties and existing literature, 
thereby aiding in the etiological analysis of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Azo dyes are used in textiles and leather clothing. Human exposure 
can occur from wearing textiles containing azo dyes. Since the body's enzymes 
and microbiome can cleave azo dyes, potentially resulting in mutagenic or 
carcinogenic metabolites, there is also an indirect health concern on the parent 
compounds. While several hazardous azo dyes are banned, many more are still in 
use that have not been evaluated systematically for potential health concerns. 
This systematic evidence map (SEM) aims to compile and categorize the available 
toxicological evidence on the potential human health risks of a set of 30 
market-relevant azo dyes.
METHODS: Peer-reviewed and gray literature was searched and over 20,000 studies 
were identified. These were filtered using Sciome Workbench for Interactive 
computer-Facilitated Text-mining (SWIFT) Review software with evidence stream 
tags (human, animal, in vitro) yielding 12,800 unique records. SWIFT Active (a 
machine-learning software) further facilitated title/abstract screening. 
DistillerSR software was used for additional title/abstract, full-text 
screening, and data extraction.
RESULTS: 187 studies were identified that met populations, exposures, 
comparators, and outcomes (PECO) criteria. From this pool, 54 human, 78 animal, 
and 61 genotoxicity studies were extracted into a literature inventory. 
Toxicological evidence was abundant for three azo dyes (also used as food 
additives) and sparse for five of the remaining 27 compounds. Complementary 
search in ECHA's REACH database for summaries of unpublished study reports 
revealed evidence for all 30 dyes. The question arose of how this information 
can be fed into an SEM process. Proper identification of prioritized dyes from 
various databases (including U.S. EPA's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) turned out 
to be a challenge. Evidence compiled by this SEM project can be evaluated for 
subsequent use in problem formulation efforts to inform potential regulatory 
needs and prepare for a more efficient and targeted evaluation in the future for 
human health assessments.

We present GePI, a novel Web server for large-scale text mining of molecular 
interactions from the scientific biomedical literature. GePI leverages natural 
language processing techniques to identify genes and related entities, 
interactions between those entities and biomolecular events involving them. GePI 
supports rapid retrieval of interactions based on powerful search options to 
contextualize queries targeting (lists of) genes of interest. Contextualization 
is enabled by full-text filters constraining the search for interactions to 
either sentences or paragraphs, with or without pre-defined gene lists. Our 
knowledge graph is updated several times a week ensuring the most recent 
information to be available at all times. The result page provides an overview 
of the outcome of a search, with accompanying interaction statistics and 
visualizations. A table (downloadable in Excel format) gives direct access to 
the retrieved interaction pairs, together with information about the molecular 
entities, the factual certainty of the interactions (as verbatim expressed by 
the authors), and a text snippet from the original document that verbalizes each 
interaction. In summary, our Web application offers free, easy-to-use, and 
up-to-date monitoring of gene and protein interaction information, in company 
with flexible query formulation and filtering options. GePI is available at 
https://gepi.coling.uni-jena.de/.

The CRISPR-Cas system is a highly adaptive and RNA-guided immune system found in 
bacteria and archaea, which has applications as a genome editing tool and is a 
valuable system for studying the co-evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage 
interactions. Here introduces CRISPRimmunity, a new web server designed for Acr 
prediction, identification of novel class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci, and dissection of 
key CRISPR-associated molecular events. CRISPRimmunity is built on a suite of 
CRISPR-oriented databases providing a comprehensive co-evolutionary perspective 
of the CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR systems. The platform achieved a high 
prediction accuracy of 0.997 for Acr prediction when tested on a dataset of 99 
experimentally validated Acrs and 676 non-Acrs, outperforming other existing 
prediction tools. Some of the newly identified class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci using 
CRISPRimmunity have been experimentally validated for cleavage activity in 
vitro. CRISPRimmunity offers the catalogues of pre-identified CRISPR systems to 
browse and query, the collected resources or databases to download, a 
well-designed graphical interface, a detailed tutorial, multi-faceted 
information, and exportable results in machine-readable formats, making it easy 
to use and facilitating future experimental design and further data mining. The 
platform is available at http://www.microbiome-bigdata.com/CRISPRimmunity. 
Moreover, the source code for batch analysis are published on Github 
(https://github.com/HIT-ImmunologyLab/CRISPRimmunity).

Microbiome-based diagnosis of cancer is an increasingly important supplement for 
the genomics approach in cancer diagnosis, yet current models for 
microbiome-based diagnosis of cancer face difficulties in generality: not only 
diagnosis models could not be adapted from one cancer to another, but models 
built based on microbes from tissues could not be adapted for diagnosis based on 
microbes from blood. Therefore, a microbiome-based model suitable for a broad 
spectrum of cancer types is urgently needed. Here we have introduced 
DeepMicroCancer, a diagnosis model using artificial intelligence techniques for 
a broad spectrum of cancer types. Built based on the random forest models it has 
enabled superior performances on more than twenty types of cancers' tissue 
samples. And by using the transfer learning techniques, improved accuracies 
could be obtained, especially for cancer types with only a few samples, which 
could satisfy the requirement in clinical scenarios. Moreover, transfer learning 
techniques have enabled high diagnosis accuracy that could also be achieved for 
blood samples. These results indicated that certain sets of microbes could, if 
excavated using advanced artificial techniques, reveal the intricate differences 
among cancers and healthy individuals. Collectively, DeepMicroCancer has 
provided a new venue for accurate diagnosis of cancer based on tissue and blood 
materials, which could potentially be used in clinics.

Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) are made by various organisms for complex 
carbohydrate metabolism. Genome mining of CAZymes has become a routine data 
analysis in (meta-)genome projects, owing to the importance of CAZymes in 
bioenergy, microbiome, nutrition, agriculture, and global carbon recycling. In 
2012, dbCAN was provided as an online web server for automated CAZyme 
annotation. dbCAN2 (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2) was further developed in 2018 as 
a meta server to combine multiple tools for improved CAZyme annotation. dbCAN2 
also included CGC-Finder, a tool for identifying CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in 
(meta-)genomes. We have updated the meta server to dbCAN3 with the following new 
functions and components: (i) dbCAN-sub as a profile Hidden Markov Model 
database (HMMdb) for substrate prediction at the CAZyme subfamily level; (ii) 
searching against experimentally characterized polysaccharide utilization loci 
(PULs) with known glycan substates of the dbCAN-PUL database for substrate 
prediction at the CGC level; (iii) a majority voting method to consider all 
CAZymes with substrate predicted from dbCAN-sub for substrate prediction at the 
CGC level; (iv) improved data browsing and visualization of substrate prediction 
results on the website. In summary, dbCAN3 not only inherits all the functions 
of dbCAN2, but also integrates three new methods for glycan substrate 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination has been a 
worldwide environmental issue because of its impact on ecosystems and human 
health. Biodegradation plays an important role in PAH removal in natural 
environments. To date, many PAH-degrading strains and degradation genes have 
been reported. However, a comprehensive PAH-degrading gene database is still 
lacking, hindering a deep understanding of PAH degraders in the era of big data. 
Furthermore, the relationships between the PAH-catabolic genotype and phenotype 
remain unclear.
RESULTS: Here, we established a bacterial PAH-degrading gene database and 
explored PAH biodegradation capability via a genome-function relationship 
approach. The investigation of functional genes in the experimentally verified 
PAH degraders indicated that genes encoding hydratase-aldolase could serve as a 
biomarker for preliminarily identifying potential degraders. Additionally, a 
genome-centric interpretation of PAH-degrading genes was performed in the public 
genome database, demonstrating that they were ubiquitous in Proteobacteria and 
Actinobacteria. Meanwhile, the global phylogenetic distribution was generally 
consistent with the culture-based evidence. Notably, a few strains affiliated 
with the genera without any previously known PAH degraders (Hyphomonas, Hoeflea, 
Henriciella, Saccharomonospora, Sciscionella, Tepidiphilus, and Xenophilus) also 
bore a complete PAH-catabolic gene cluster, implying their potential of PAH 
biodegradation. Moreover, a random forest analysis was applied to predict the 
PAH-degrading trait in the complete genome database, revealing 28 newly 
predicted PAH degraders, of which nine strains encoded a complete PAH-catabolic 
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results established a comprehensive PAH-degrading gene database 
and a genome-function relationship approach, which revealed several potential 
novel PAH-degrader lineages. Importantly, this genome-centric and 
function-oriented approach can overcome the bottleneck of conventional 
cultivation-based biodegradation research and substantially expand our current 
knowledge on the potential degraders of environmental pollutants.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by low bone mass 
and deterioration of micro-architectural bone tissue. The most common type of OP 
is postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP), with fragility fractures becoming a 
global burden for women. Recently, the gut microbiota has been connected to bone 
metabolism. The aim of this study was to characterize the gut microbiota 
signatures in PMOP patients and controls. Fecal samples from 21 PMOP patients 
and 37 controls were collected and analyzed using amplicon sequencing of the 
V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The bone mineral density (BMD) measurement 
and laboratory biochemical test were performed on all participants. Two feature 
selection algorithms, maximal information coefficient (MIC) and XGBoost, were 
employed to identify the PMOP-related microbial features. Results showed that 
the composition of gut microbiota changed in PMOP patients, and microbial 
abundances were more correlated with total hip BMD/T-score than lumbar spine 
BMD/T-score. Using the MIC and XGBoost methods, we identified a set of 
PMOP-related microbes; a logistic regression model revealed that two microbial 
markers (Fusobacteria and Lactobacillaceae) had significant abilities in disease 
classification between the PMOP and control groups. Taken together, the findings 
of this study provide new insights into the etiology of OP/PMOP, as well as 
modulating gut microbiota as a therapeutic target in the diseases. We also 
highlight the application of feature selection approaches in biological data 
mining and data analysis, which may improve the research in medical and life 
sciences.
