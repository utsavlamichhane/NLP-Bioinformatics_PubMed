The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. 
Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice 
hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin 
commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal 
commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize 
the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania 
pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in 
enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune 
surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal 
environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in 
mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined 
that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial 
IL-33 and downstream IL-33-ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. 
Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to 
helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a 
context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse 
commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal 
commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse 
facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental 
outcomes and phenotypes.

Most studies on the human gut microbiome have focused on the bacterial fraction 
rather than fungal biomics, which as resulted in an incomplete understanding of 
the fungal microbiome. Recent advances in microbiota detection and 
next-generation sequencing technology have boosted an increase in research on 
fungi. Symbiotic fungi have become increasingly influential in health and 
disease and modulate various physiologic functions within the host. Fungal 
infections can result in high morbidity and mortality rates and are 
life-threatening in some immunocompromised patients. In addition to bacterial 
dysbiosis, alterations in fungal communities are important and have been linked 
to many diseases, including asthma, mental illness, and various cancers. When 
investigating cancer it is imperative to consider the role of fungi alongside 
viruses and bacteria. This review examined the impact of intestinal fungi and 
peri-tumor fungi on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and response to 
anticancer therapies. The review highlights the specific involvement of some 
fungal species in cancers include digestive tract tumors such as colorectal, 
pancreatic, liver, and gastric cancers, as well as non-digestive tract tumors 
such as lung, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, fungal 
mechanisms of action, including fungus-host recognition and immune regulation, 
biofilm formation, toxin and metabolite production in the tumor 
microenvironment, and the complex effects of fungus-bacteria interactions on 
tumorigenesis and development, highlight the significance of potential 
biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Metabolic-related diseases are chronic diseases caused by multiple factors, such 
as genetics and the environment. These diseases are difficult to cure and 
seriously affect human health. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), the second 
rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, plays an important role in 
cholesterol synthesis and alters the gut microbiota and tumor immunity. Research 
has shown that SQLE is expressed in many tissues and organs and is involved in 
the occurrence and development of various metabolic-related diseases, such as 
cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. SQLE 
inhibitors, such as terbinafine, NB598, natural compounds, and their 
derivatives, can effectively ameliorate fungal infections, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of recent 
research progress on the role of SQLE in metabolic-related diseases. Further 
research on the regulation of SQLE expression is highly important for developing 
drugs for the treatment of metabolic-related diseases with good pharmacological 
activity.

PURPOSE: Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC) is a problematic clinical 
condition for which fluconazole treatment is commonly prescribed. This study 
investigated the interkingdom vaginal and gastrointestinal microbiomes of RVVC 
patients who use fluconazole intermittently or as longer-term maintenance 
therapy for symptom management and compared them to healthy controls.
METHODS: Vaginal swabs and fecal samples were collected. A novel interkingdom 
analysis was performed using 16 S rRNA and ITS1 gene sequencing to compare the 
diversity and taxonomic composition of vaginal microbiome (VMB) and 
gastrointestinal microbiome (GIMB).
RESULTS: Twenty-seven women participated: 10 intermittent users and healthy 
controls and 7 maintenance therapy. The study revealed that microbiomes of 
fluconazole users do not differ in diversity metrics from healthy controls. RVVC 
patients using intermittent fluconazole displayed a higher abundance of vaginal 
C. albicans than healthy controls. Candida species pairings were not commonly 
observed between sites in individuals and, as such a fecal reservoir is unlikely 
to be implicated in recurrent symptomatology. In many of the RVVC non-Candida 
fungal spp. were identified in the vaginal microbiome. Users of fluconazole 
displayed elevations of the CST-I (Community State Type 1) associated bacterium 
L. crispatus. All participants displaying vaginal Candida spp. belonged to 
either bacterial CST-I or CST-III (Community State Type 3- L. iners associated).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the 
interkingdom VMB-GIMB of women with RVVC using oral fluconazole. As fluconazole 
users in this study represent a typical RVVC population, trends observed in 
microbial abundance require further analysis to establish fluconazole's 
long-term microbiome safety. Examining the microbiome at both sites adds to the 
current understanding of microbial associated with the condition.

OBJECTIVES: Ascites, often associated with critical pathologies such as liver 
cirrhosis or bowel perforation, can be complicated by fungal infection, 
increasing mortality especially in intensive care settings and demanding rapid 
diagnosis and adequate treatment. Traditional microbiological diagnostic methods 
have limited sensitivity in accurately identifying fungal pathogens in ascitic 
fluid. Alternative diagnostic methods may offer important insights to enable 
guiding of antifungal therapy and refining empirical treatment strategies. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of next-generation 
sequencing methods to identify specific fungal pathogens responsible for ascitic 
fluid infections.
METHODS: We prospectively collected 50 ascitic fluid samples from ICU patients 
with suspected ascites infection. In addition to standard culture-based 
microbiological testing, an ascitic fluid aliquot underwent fungal DNA isolation 
and was analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for identification 
of fungal species.
RESULTS: Of 50 ascitic samples collected, five samples showed growth of Candida 
spp. in culture. After DNA isolation and ITS2 PCR, detectable amplification was 
achieved in 10 samples. Sequencing of the 50 patients' samples identified 
facultative pathogenic fungi in 19 patients. In 15 cases, culture alone would 
not have permitted the identification of all facultative pathogenic fungi. The 
identification of fungal DNA by sequencing was significantly associated with 
poor patient outcome and a number of clinical parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a higher sensitivity for NGS-based diagnostic 
methods in the identification of ascitic fluid fungal infections compared to 
culture-based diagnostics. This may be beneficial especially for patients in a 
critical care setting, who have an increased prevalence of comorbidities and 
high mortality. The implementation of such methods in standard diagnosis will 
require increased standardization of the workflows and interpretation of the 
sequencing results with respect to patients' clinical picture.

The phyllospheric microbial composition of tobacco plants is influenced by 
multiple factors. Disease severity level is one of the main influencing factors. 
This study was designed to understand the microbial community in tobacco 
wildfire disease with different disease severity levels. Tobacco leaves at 
disease severity level of 1, 5, 7, and 9 (L1, L5, L7, and L9) were collected; 
both healthy and diseased leaf tissues for each level were collected. The 
community structure and diversity in tobacco leaves with different disease 
severity levels were compared using high-throughput technique and Biolog Eco. 
The results showed that in all healthy and diseased tobacco leaves, the most 
dominant bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria with a high prevalence of genus 
Pseudomonas; the relative abundance of Pseudomonas was most found at B9 diseased 
samples. Ascomycota represents the most prominent fungal phylum, with 
Blastobotrys as the predominant genus. In bacterial communities, the Alpha 
diversity of healthy samples was higher than that of diseased samples. In fungal 
community, the difference in Alpha diversity between healthy and diseased was 
not significant. LEfSe analysis showed that the most enriched bacterial 
biomarker was unclassified_Gammaproteobacteria in diseased samples; 
unclassified_Alcaligenaceae were the most enrich bacterial biomarker in healthy 
samples. FUNGuild analysis showed that saprotroph was the dominated mode in 
health and lower diseased samples, The abundance of pathotroph-saprotroph and 
pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph increases at high disease levels. PICRUSt 
analysis showed that the predominant pathway was metabolism function, and most 
bacterial gene sequences seem to be independent of the disease severity level. 
The Biolog Eco results showed that the utilization rates of carbon sources 
decrease with increasing disease severity level. The current study revealed the 
microbial community's characteristic of tobacco wildfire disease with different 
disease severity levels, providing scientific references for the control of 
tobacco wildfire disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Otitis externa (OE) is a very common disease in 
Australia. It is associated with swimming and exposure to water. Typically, 
treatment consists of aural toileting and the use of topical antimicrobial 
drops. Antimicrobial treatment is empiric, and most Australian guidelines advise 
the use of dexamethasone/framycetin/gramicidin as first-line therapy. This study 
aimed to identify the most prevalent pathogens implicated in OE in Queensland, 
Australia, and determine if there was any variability with the season, proximity 
to a coastline, age, gender and First Nations status.
METHOD: The primary pathogen cultured, the specimen type, the date of collection 
and the patient demographics were retrieved from microbiology swabs sent from 
hospitals to Pathology Queensland. Multivariate analysis was performed on the 
swabs.
RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent pathogen cultured in the 
external ear in Queensland, at 37.9%. In inland regions, Staphylococcus aureus 
was the most prevalent organism. Children were three-fold less likely to have OE 
resulting from a fungal pathogen.
DISCUSSION: The use of targeted antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
coastal regions during summer is sensible. Due to the low burden of fungal 
disease in children, there should be a high threshold for the commencement of 
antifungal ear drops.

Candida albicans is a fungal constituent of the human gastrointestinal 
microbiota that can tolerate acidic environments like the stomach, where it can 
be associated with ulcers and chronic gastritis. In mice, C. albicans induces 
gastritis without concurrent intestinal inflammation, suggesting that the 
stomach is particularly prone to fungal infection. We previously showed that C. 
albicans invasion in the limiting ridge does not extend to or elicit an 
inflammatory response in the adjacent glandular region, indicating regionalized 
gastritis in the murine stomach. However, the molecular pathways involved in the 
host response to C. albicans specifically in the limiting ridge have not been 
investigated. Here, we found that gastric dysbiosis was associated with C. 
albicans limiting ridge colonization and gastritis. We isolated the limiting 
ridge and evaluated the expression of over 90 genes involved in mucosal 
responses. C. albicans infection triggered a type 3 immune response marked by 
elevated Il17a, Il17f, Il1b, Tnf, and Il36g, as well as an upregulation of 
Il12a, Il4, Il10, and l13. Chemokine gene induction (including Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, 
Ccl1l, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10) coincided with an influx of neutrophils, 
monocytes/macrophages, and eosinophils. Hyphal invasion caused tissue damage, 
epithelial remodeling, and upregulation of genes linked to epithelium signaling 
and antimicrobial responses in the limiting ridge. Our findings support a need 
for continued exploration into the interactions between the immunological 
milieu, the host microbiota, and clinical interventions such as the use of 
antibiotics and immunotherapeutic agents and their collective impact on invasive 
candidiasis risk.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a critical condition with high mortality 
rates and is worsened by infections. Organ failure is strongly associated with 
intestinal dysbiosis. Emerging research suggests that gut microbiota modulation 
with probiotics can improve AH outcomes. This study investigated the clinical 
and microbiome effects of high-dose probiotic infusion (HDPI) compared with 
corticosteroid therapy (CST) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in 
severe AH. Patients with biopsy-proven severe-AH were enrolled from March 2019 
to June 2020 and matched for age and disease severity. The patients received 
HDPI (n = 20), FMT (n = 16), or CST (n = 14). HDPI consists of a potent 
probiotic mix delivered via a nasoduodenal tube for 6 days. The primary outcome 
was survival at 90-days. Stool samples were subjected to 16S and 18S rRNA 
sequencing to assess significant bacterial and fungal taxa and their 
interactions at baseline and post treatment. At 90-days, survival rates were 
55%, 64.3%, and 87.5% (HDPI, CST, respectively). HDPI did not beneficially 
impact bacterial alpha-diversity but significantly altered beta-diversity. 
Notably, the number of pathogenic bacteria, such as Bilophila and Roseburia 
increased. Fungal analysis revealed no significant changes in alpha diversity, 
but significant dissimilarities in beta diversity post-HDPI. New fungal genera 
such as Basidiomycota and Phragmoplastophyta have emerged, with significant 
deleterious expansion in fungal communities and damaging modifications between 
fungal-bacterial interactions. HDPI failed to outperform CST in improving the 
clinical outcomes of patients with severe AH. While HDPI influenced both 
bacterial and fungal microbiomes, it also led to the persistence of pathogenic 
communities. FMT showed superior survival outcomes, highlighting the urgent need 
for further controlled trials.

Drug repurposing for cancer treatment is a valuable strategy to identify 
existing drugs with known safety profiles that could combat the neoplasm, by 
reducing costs. Oral squamous cell carcinoma, an ulcer-proliferative lesion on 
the mucosal epithelium, is the most common oral malignancy. About 10% of cancer 
patients within the Indian subcontinent suffer from OSCC, primarily due to 
chewing of betel plant derivatives. Concomitant administration of the 
chemotherapeutic agent (Cisplatin/Paclitaxel) is the treatment of choice. 
Analysis of the oral mycobiome of OSCC patients has projected the role of 
Candida albicans in potentiating OSCC. Hence, repurposing antifungal drugs 
emerges as a promising approach, as these drugs could target both the cancer 
cells and the infection. Cancer cells often have heightened energy requirements, 
and targeting mitochondrial proteins to disrupt mitochondrial division and 
induce dysfunction contributing to cell death, offers a method for treating 
OSCC. We identified 18 mitochondrial targets playing a crucial role in the 
maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. They were docked against 125 
antifungal ligand molecules sourced from PUBCHEM. Ligand profiling was performed 
using Lipinski's rule of 5, SwissADME and ProTox. Also, molecular dynamics and 
MM-PBSA were performed to validate our results. Among all protein ligand 
interactions, we observed that targeting DRP1 with itraconazole yielded superior 
binding and stability. Overall, lower toxicity and thumping ADME properties 
solidified the choice of ligand. We hope this experimental approach will enable 
us to provide a basis for selecting a lead molecule for a possible novel 
nano-formulation and validate our finding through in-vitro cell line-based 
testing.

Thermal seed treatment can be used as an alternative method to prevent infection 
by seed-borne diseases, but exposure duration and temperature during thermal 
treatment are important to maintain high seed viability and emergence whilst 
decreasing infection rate. A method for predicting suitable treatment parameters 
to maintain viability and eliminate seed-borne pathogens is therefore needed. 
Seeds of winter wheat were subjected to thermal treatment at four levels of 
intensity and pre-treatments with or without imbibition. Treatment impact was 
measured by metabolome analysis using LC-MS and GC-MS, analysis of spermosphere 
bacterial and fungal metagenomes using Illumina MiSeq, and detection of presence 
of Fusarium spp. and Microdochium spp. using ddPCR. The results showed that 
moderate treatment intensity reduced signs of infection and increased seedling 
emergence. In imbibed samples, myo-inositol concentration and myo-inositol: 
glucose ratio were positively correlated with treatment intensity, whereas 
concentrations of glucose and citric acid were negatively correlated. No 
correlations were found for non-imbibed samples. Imbibition had a large 
significant impact on microbial community composition of the wheat spermosphere. 
Imbibition of wheat seeds prior to thermal treatment altered wheat spermosphere 
microbiota. The concentration of myo-inositol, potentially in combination with 
glucose, could be a candidate predictor for suitable thermal treatment intensity 
of wheat seeds.

BACKGROUND: Identifying effective biological control agents against fungal 
pathogens and determining their mechanisms of action are important in the 
control of plant diseases.
RESULTS: In this study, we isolated an endophytic bacterial strain, GsB01, from 
the branches of asymptomatic Gleditsia sinensis. Multi-locus sequence analysis 
identified the strain as Bacillus velezensis. GsB01 exhibited significant 
antifungal activity against Thyronectria austroamericana, the causative agent of 
G. sinensis wilt. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified four 
consistently present antimicrobial compounds in GsB01 metabolite fractions with 
high antifungal activity: macrolactin A, bacillaene A, surfactin, and iturin. 
GsB01's active metabolite fractions altered the metabolic profiles of T. 
austroamericana, disrupting seven pathways, including arginine biosynthesis, 
nucleotide metabolism, purine metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway. 
Furthermore, absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested 
that GsB01 may increase the abundance of endophytic bacteria in G. sinensis. The 
16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed changes in the endophytic landscape in 
stems and roots following GsB01 introduction, particularly with significant 
variation in the dominant bacterial genera within the stems.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights GsB01's potential against plant wilt and 
suggests that its antifungal activity is achieved by secreting antifungal 
metabolites. The study also recorded changes in the symbiotic microbiota within 
trees that had been infected with a pathogenic fungus and subsequently treated 
with an endophytic antagonistic bacterial strain. © 2024 Society of Chemical

Adaptation of Candida albicans to specific host environments by gain-of-function 
mutations in transcription factors.

Morschhäuser J(1).

Germany.

The yeast Candida albicans is usually a harmless member of the normal microbiota 
in healthy persons but is also a major fungal pathogen that can colonize and 
infect almost every human tissue. A successful adaptation to environmental 
changes encountered in different host niches requires an appropriate regulation 
of gene expression. The zinc cluster transcription factors are the largest 
family of transcriptional regulators in C. albicans and are involved in the 
control of virtually all aspects of its biology. Under certain circumstances, 
mutations in these transcription factors that alter their activity and the 
expression of their target genes confer a selective advantage, which results in 
the emergence of phenotypically altered variants that are better adapted to new 
environmental challenges. This review describes how gain-of-function mutations 
in different zinc cluster transcription factors enable C. albicans to overcome 
antifungal therapy and to successfully establish itself in specific host niches.

This article reviews of the original research published by Wu et al in the World 
Journal of Gastroenterology, delving into the pivotal role of the gut microbiota 
in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Insights were gained from fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mouse models, revealing the intricate 
interplay between the gut microbiota, mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT), and 
creeping fat. The study uncovered the characteristics of inflammation and 
fibrosis in the MAT and intestinal tissues of patients with CD; moreover, 
through the FMT mouse model, it observed the impact of samples from healthy 
patients and those with CD on symptoms. The pathogenesis of CD is complex, and 
its etiology remains unclear; however, it is widely believed that gut microbiota 
dysbiosis plays a significant role. Recently, with the development and 
application of next-generation sequencing technology, research on the role of 
fungi in the pathogenesis and chronicity of CD has deepened. This editorial 
serves as a supplement to the research by Wu et al who discussed advances 
related to the study of fungi in CD.

Innate immunity in asthma may be influenced by alterations in lung microbiota, 
potentially affecting disease severity. This study investigates the differences 
in lung inflammation and microbiome between asthma-ovalbumin (OVA) administered 
with and without fluconazole treatment in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, the role 
of inflammation was examined in an in vitro study using a pulmonary cell line. 
At 30 days post-OVA administration, allergic asthma mice exhibited increased 
levels of IgE and IL-4 in serum and lung tissue, higher pathological scores, and 
elevated eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) compared to control 
mice. Asthma inflammation was characterized by elevated serum IL-6, increased 
lung cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10), and higher fungal abundance confirmed by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fluconazole-treated asthma mice displayed 
higher levels of cytokines in serum and lung tissue (TNF-α and IL-6), increased 
pathological scores, and a higher number of mononuclear cells in BALF, with 
undetectable fungal levels compared to untreated mice. Lung microbiome analysis 
revealed similarities between control and asthma mice; however, 
fluconazole-treated asthma mice exhibited higher Bacteroidota levels, lower 
Firmicutes, and reduced bacterial abundance. Pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production was increased in supernatants of the pulmonary cell line (NCI-H292) 
after co-stimulation with LPS and beta-glucan (BG) compared to LPS alone. 
Fluconazole treatment in OVA-induced asthma mice exacerbated inflammation, 
partially due to fungi and Gram-negative bacteria, as demonstrated by 
LPS+BG-activated pulmonary cells. Therefore, fluconazole should be reserved for 
treating fungal asthma rather than asthma caused by other etiologies.

BACKGROUND: This article employs bibliometric methods and visual maps to 
delineate the research background, collaborative relationships, hotspots, and 
trends in the study of gut fungi in human diseases and health.
METHODS: Publications related to human gut fungi were retrieved from the Web of 
Science Core Collection. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, R software and Microsoft Excel 
were employed to generate visual representations illustrating the contributions 
made by countries/regions, authors, organizations, and journals. Employing 
VOSviewer and CiteSpace, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the retrieved 
publications, revealing underlying tendencies, research hotspots, and intricate 
knowledge networks.
RESULTS: This study analyzed a total of 3,954 publications. The United States 
ranks first in the number of published papers and has the highest number of 
citations and h-index. Mostafa S Elshahed is the most prolific author. The 
University of California System is the institution that published the most 
papers. Frontiers In Microbiology is the journal with the largest number of 
publications. Three frequently co-cited references have experienced a citation 
burst lasting until 2024.
CONCLUSION: Advancements in sequencing technologies have intensified research 
into human gut fungi and their health implications, shifting the research focus 
from gut fungal infections towards microbiome science. Inflammatory bowel 
diseases and Candida albicans have emerged as pivotal areas of interest in this 
endeavor. Through this study, we have gained a deeper insight into global trends 
and frontier hotspots within this field, thereby enhancing our understanding of 
the intricate relationship between gut fungi and human health.

Candida albicans infection poses a significant global health threat. It is 
imperative to exploit new antifungal agents against C. albicans infections 
without leading to drug resistance, so that these potential agents can 
complement or combine with current medications to effectively treat diseases 
caused by C. albicans. We screened moscatin, and assessed the inhibitory 
effectiveness against C. albicans SC5314 on hyphae production and biofilm 
formation. It was revealed that moscatin exhibited significant effects on 
morphological transition and biofilm formation in C. albicans SC5314. It also 
lowered the pathogenicity of C. albicans SC5314 in a concentration-dependent way 
in both A549 cells and mice fungal infection models, but had no cytotoxicity to 
A549 cells. In addition, moscatin attenuated the virulence of clinical 
fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and exhibited synergistic activity with 
fluconazole. It could also restore the composition and richness of the 
intestinal microbiota in mice infected by C. albicans. These findings indicate 
that these moscatin has great potential to be developed as a new therapeutic 
drug against C. albicans infection.

BACKGROUND: The importance of gut microbes in mediating the benefits of 
lifestyle intervention is increasingly recognized. However, compared to the 
bacterial microbiome, the role of intestinal fungi in exercise remains elusive. 
With our established randomized controlled trial of exercise intervention in 
Chinese males with prediabetes (n = 39, ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03240978), we 
investigated the dynamics of human gut mycobiome and further interrogated their 
associations with exercise-elicited outcomes using multi-omics approaches.
METHODS: Clinical variations and biological samples were collected before and 
after training. Fecal fungal composition was analyzed using the internal 
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing and integrated with paired shotgun 
metagenomics, untargeted metabolomics, and Olink proteomics.
RESULTS: Twelve weeks of exercise training profoundly promoted fungal ecological 
diversity and intrakingdom connection. We further identified exercise-responsive 
genera with potential metabolic benefits, including Verticillium, Sarocladium, 
and Ceratocystis. Using multi-omics approaches, we elucidated comprehensive 
associations between changes in gut mycobiome and exercise-shaped metabolic 
phenotypes, bacterial microbiome, and circulating metabolomics and proteomics 
profiles. Furthermore, a machine-learning algorithm built using baseline 
microbial signatures and clinical characteristics predicted exercise 
responsiveness in improvements of insulin sensitivity, with an area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97) in the 
discovery cohort and of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86) in the independent validation 
cohort (n = 30).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intense exercise training significantly 
remodels the human fungal microbiome composition. Changes in gut fungal 
composition are associated with the metabolic benefits of exercise, indicating 
gut mycobiome is a possible molecular transducer of exercise. Moreover, baseline 
gut fungal signatures predict exercise responsiveness for diabetes prevention, 
highlighting that targeting the gut mycobiome emerges as a prospective strategy 
in tailoring personalized training for diabetes prevention.

China.

RATIONALE: Elderly patients with acute liver failure are highly susceptible to 
severe complications, such as invasive fungal infections, due to weakened immune 
systems and altered gut microbiota. A thorough understanding of liver failure 
and opportunistic infections is crucial for effective management.
PATIENT CONCERNS: An 84-year-old male with acute liver failure from hepatitis E 
experienced worsening jaundice despite standard treatments. He also developed 
respiratory symptoms, including blood-streaked sputum, raising concerns about a 
potential fungal infection.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with acute liver failure secondary to 
hepatitis E and an invasive fungal infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. 
Initial treatments included artificial liver plasma exchange and antifungal 
prophylaxis. Further diagnostics, including bronchoscopy and next-generation 
sequencing of alveolar lavage fluid, confirmed the Aspergillus infection.
LESSONS: Elderly liver failure patients are particularly prone to opportunistic 
infections, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and early 
intervention. Despite aggressive treatments, including antifungal therapy and 
artificial liver support, prognosis remains poor, highlighting the importance of 
prompt diagnosis and comprehensive management to enhance patient outcomes.

Bats are known reservoirs for a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, 
including viruses, bacteria, fungi, helminths, and protozoa, which can be 
transmitted and infect other zoonotic organisms. Various studies have utilised 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) to describe the pathogens associated with bats. 
Although most have characterised microbial communities in specific body fluids, 
few have analysed the composition and diversity of these microbial communities 
across different body fluids at the individual level. In this study, we employed 
two next-generation sequencing techniques: amplicon-based sequencing of the V4 
hypervariable region of the 16S- and 18S-rRNA genes and viral metagenomics, to 
describe the prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral communities present in blood, 
faeces, and oral swab samples collected from two genera of bats (Carollia and 
Phyllostomus) in the department of Casanare, eastern Colombia. A total of 60 
samples corresponding to the three bodily fluids were processed and analysed. 
The results indicated that the microbial communities across the body fluids were 
mainly composed of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and various DNA and RNA viruses, 
showing a variability of microbial genera and species. The abundances, diversity 
metrics, and correlations of these microorganisms displayed patterns associated 
with bat genus and body fluids, suggesting that the ecological characteristics 
of these microbial communities may be influenced by the ecological and 
physiological traits of the bats. Additionally, we found similar community 
compositions of bacteria, some fungal genera, and viruses in the three body 
fluids, indicating a possible circulation of these microbes within the same bat. 
This could be due to microbial movement from the gut microbiota to other 
physiological systems or transmission via blood-feeding vectors. Furthermore, 
our results revealed the presence of various microbes of public health concern, 
including Bartonella spp., Mannheimia haemolytica, Rhodotorula spp., 
Piroplasmida spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Alphacoronavirus spp., and Bat circovirus. 
The abundance of these pathogenic microbial species across the three bodily 
fluids suggests potential transmission routes from bats to other organisms, 
which may contribute to the emergence of zoonotic disease outbreaks. These 
findings highlight the variability of microorganisms present within the same bat 
and the different pathogen-host interactions that may regulate the presence and 
transmission of these zoonotic microbes. Further research is required to 
elucidate the genomic features, ecological interactions, and biological 
activities of these microbial communities in bats.

This study aimed to investigate the presence and diversity of fungal parasites 
in Arctic coastal microphytobenthic communities. These communities represent a 
key component in the functioning of Arctic trophic food webs. Fungal parasites, 
particularly Chytridiomycota (chytrids), play significant roles by controlling 
microalgal bloom events, impacting genetic diversity, modifying microbial 
interactions, and accelerating nutrient and energy transfer to higher trophic 
levels. In the context of rapid Arctic warming and increased glacier meltwater, 
which significantly affects these communities, we used high-throughput 
sequencing to explore fungal community composition. Our results show that 
chytrids dominate fungal communities in Arctic benthic habitats and that the 
overall fungal diversity is primarily influenced by the salinity gradient. 
Chytrid representation is positively correlated with the presence of potential 
benthic diatom (Surirella, Nitzschia, Navicula) and green algae (Ulvophyceae) 
hosts, while microscopic observations provide further evidence for the presence

Fungi of the genus Aspergillus are widespread in the environment, where they 
produce large quantities of airborne conidia. Inhalation of Aspergillus spp. 
conidia in immunocompromised individuals can cause a wide spectrum of diseases, 
ranging from hypersensitivity responses to lethal invasive infections. Upon 
deposition in the lung epithelial surface, conidia encounter and interact with 
complex microbial communities that constitute the lung microbiota. The lung 
microbiota has been suggested to influence the establishment and growth of 
Aspergillus spp. in the human airways. However, the mechanisms underlying this 
interaction have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we aimed 
to enrich and isolate bacterial strains capable of inhibiting the germination 
and growth of A. fumigatus conidia from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 
samples of lung transplant recipients using a novel enrichment method. This 
method is based on a soft agar overlay plate assay in which bacteria are 
directly in contact with conidia, allowing inhibition to be readily observed 
during enrichment. We isolated a total of five clonal bacterial strains with 
identical genotypic fingerprints, as shown by random amplified polymorphic DNA 
PCR (RAPD-PCR). All strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strains 
b1-b5). The strains were able to inhibit the germination and growth of 
Aspergillus fumigatus in a soft agar confrontation assay, as well as in a 
germination multiplate assay. Moreover, when compared with ten P. aeruginosa 
strains isolated from expectoration through standard methods, no significant 
differences in inhibitory potential were observed. Additionally, we showed 
inhibition of A. fumigatus growth on Calu-3 cell culture monolayers. However, 
the isolated P. aeruginosa strains were shown to cause significant damage to the 
cell monolayers. Overall, although P. aeruginosa is a known opportunistic lung 
pathogen and antagonist of A. fumigatus, we validated this novel one-step 
enrichment approach for the isolation of bacterial strains antagonistic to A. 
fumigatus from BALF samples as a proof-of-concept. This opens up a new venue for 
the targeted enrichment of antagonistic bacterial strains against specific 
fungal pathogens.

Microbiomes are sustained through infinite yet mutually interacting microbial 
communities, with bacteria and fungi serving as the major constituents. In 
recent times, microbial interventions have become popular for microbiome 
manipulation to achieve sustainable goals. Whether and how the introduced 
biocontrol agent drives fungal microbial assemblages (mycobiome) and the role of 
interkingdom signaling in shaping the microbiome structure and function remain 
poorly understood. Here, we implemented wild-type (WT) Bacillus subtilis L1-21 
and its quorum quenching (QQ) mutants (L1-21Δytnp, and L1-21Δyxel) individually 
and as consortia to explore the enrichment patterns of key mycobiome members in 
Huanglongbing (HLB) infected citrus compartments including leaf endosphere, root 
endosphere, and rhizosphere soil. The application of WT and its QQ mutants 
produced differential mycobiome enrichment across citrus compartments. Our 
findings reveal that application of WT B. subtilis enriched beneficial fungi 
such as Trichoderma (15.82 %) in leaf endosphere. In contrast, pathogenic fungi 
Fusarium (47.5 %) and Gibberella (0.47 %) involved in citrus root decline were 
adundant in the L1-21Δytnp treated root endosphere while Nigrospora (11 %) was 
predominant in L1-21Δyxel treated leaf endosphere, affirming the role of 
bacterial quorum sensing (QS) molecules in shaping the fungal community 
composition. In general, based on the fungal functional prediction, fungal 
pathogens were highly abundant in mutant-treated plants, particularly in leaf 
endosphere (L1-21Δytnp: 25 %; L1-21Δyxel: 36.35 %) compared to WT (20.93%). 
Additionally, some fungal members exhibited strong compartment specificity and 
both mutants induced distinct mycobiome shifts in rhizosphere soil, leaf, and 
root endopshere. In conclusion, B. subtilis QQ modifies bacterial QS networks 
facilitating beneficial fungi to establish, while loss of QQ leads to enrichment 
of pathogenic fungal groups. Our study provides a direct link of perception and 
regulation of mycobiome through bacterial-based QS and QQ system, and its 
association with disease outcomes.

Increasing researches reveal gut microbiota was associated with the development 
of tuberculosis (TB). How to prevent or reduce Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
colonization in the lungs is a key measure to prevent TB. However, the data on 
gut microbiota preventing Mycobacterium colonization in the lungs were scarce. 
Here, we established the clindamycin-inducing intestinal microbiome dysbiosis 
and fecal microbial transplantation models in mice to identify gut microbiota's 
effect on Mycobacterium's colonization in the mouse lungs and explore its 
potential mechanisms. The results showed that clindamycin treatment altered the 
diversity and composition of the intestinal bacterial and fungal microbiome, 
weakened the trans-kingdom network interactions between bacteria and fungi, and 
induced gut microbiome dysbiosis in the mice. Gut microbiota dysbiosis increases 
intestinal permeability and enhances the susceptibility of Mycobacterium 
colonization in the lungs of mice. The potential mechanisms were gut microbiota 
dysbiosis altered the lung transcriptome and increased Nos2 expression through 
the 'gut-lung axis'. Nos2 high expression disrupts the intracellular 
antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment by increasing the concentration 
of nitric oxide, decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and Defb1 in 
the cells, and promoting Mycobacteria colonization in the lungs of mice. The 
present study raises a potential strategy for reducing the risks of Mycobacteria 
infections and transmission by regulating the gut microbiome balance.

The transmission of microorganisms via hands is a critical factor in 
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), underscoring the importance of rigorous 
hand hygiene. The rise of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, driven in part 
by the overuse of antibiotics in clinical medicine, presents a significant 
global health challenge. Antimicrobial soaps, although commonly used, may 
exacerbate bacterial resistance and disrupt skin microbiota, posing additional 
health risks and environmental hazards. Essential oils, with their 
broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, offer a promising alternative. This 
study evaluates the antimicrobial activity of essential oils against various 
bacterial and fungal strains, including multidrug-resistant isolates. Using a 
range of in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial assays, including minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal 
fungicidal concentration (MFC), the essential oils were tested against a broad 
spectrum of pathogens. Additionally, the chemical composition of the oils was 
analyzed in detail using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS). Clove, 
oregano, and thyme oils demonstrated potent inhibition of all tested ATCC 
bacterial strains, with MIC values ranging from 3.125 to 50 μL/mL. These oils 
also showed significant activity against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Notably, clove oil exhibited remarkable 
efficacy against fungal strains such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton 
rubrum, with MIC values as low as 1.56 μL/mL. Synergy tests revealed that 
combinations of clove, oregano, and thyme oils yielded significantly lower MIC 
values than individual oils, indicating additive or synergistic effects. The 
formulation of a soap incorporating clove and oregano oils demonstrated efficacy 
comparable to synthetic antiseptics in vivo. These findings highlight the 
exceptional antimicrobial potential of essential oils, mainly clove and oregano, 
against resistant microorganisms, offering a viable alternative to conventional 
antimicrobial agents.

BACKGROUND: Entomopathogenic fungal infection-induced dysbiosis of host 
microbiota offers a window into understanding the complex interactions between 
pathogenic fungi and host symbionts. Such insights are critical for enhancing 
the efficacy of mycoinsecticides. However, the utilization of these interactions 
in pest control remains largely unexplored.
RESULTS: Here, we found that infection by the host-specialist fungus Metarhizium 
acridum alters the composition of the symbiotic microbiota and increases the 
dominance of some bacterial symbionts in locusts. Meanwhile, M. acridum also 
effectively limits the overgrowth of the predominant bacteria. Comparative 
transcriptomic screening revealed that the fungus upregulates the production of 
MaCFEM1, an iron-binding protein, in the presence of bacteria. This protein 
sequesters iron, thereby limiting its availability. Functionally, overexpression 
of MaCFEM1 in the fungus induces iron deprivation, which significantly 
suppresses bacterial growth. Conversely, MaCFEM1 knockout relieves the 
restriction on bacterial iron availability, resulting in iron reallocation. Upon 
ΔMaCFEM1 infection, some host bacterial symbionts proliferate uncontrollably, 
turning into opportunistic pathogens and significantly accelerating host death.
CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the critical role of pathogenic 
fungal-dominated iron allocation in mediating the shift of host microbes from 
symbiosis to pathogenicity. It also highlights a unique biocontrol strategy that 
jointly exploits pathogenic fungi and bacterial symbionts to increase host 
mortality. Video Abstract.

The role of the skin microbiome in resistance and susceptibility of wildlife to 
fungal pathogens has been examined from a taxonomic perspective but skin 
microbial function, in the context of fungal infection, has yet to be studied. 
Our objective was to understand effects of a bat fungal pathogen site infection 
status and course of invasion on skin microbial function. We sampled seven 
hibernating colonies of Myotis lucifugus covering three-time points over the 
course of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) invasion and white nose syndrome 
(pre-invasion, epidemic, and established). Our results support three new 
hypotheses about Pd and skin functional microbiome: (1) there is an important 
effect of Pd invasion stage, especially at the epidemic stage; (2) disruption by 
the fungus at the epidemic stage could decrease anti-fungal functions with 
potential negative effects on the microbiome and bat health; (3) the collection 
site might have a larger influence on microbiomes at the pre-invasion stage 
rather than at epidemic and established stages. Future studies with larger 
sample sizes and using meta-omics approaches will help confirm these hypotheses, 
and determine the influence of the microbiome on wildlife survival to fungal 
disease.

Introduction. Fungal infections are relevant health risks for individuals with 
acquired immunodeficiency in the resource-limited tropics, but available 
surveillance data are scarce. For Candida auris and Cryptococcus spp., the 
evolution from environmental reservoirs to human pathogens causing 
life-threatening diseases is currently discussed as a public health concern in 
the context of climate change and limited treatment options.Gap statement. 
Uncovering the gastrointestinal tract as an epidemiological niche of fungi 
emerging from the environment into individuals for whom fungal infections are 
not diagnosed.Aim. To contribute to data on the local epidemiology of C. auris 
and Cryptococcus spp. in Western African Ghana by analysing gastrointestinal 
samples of Ghanaian individuals.Methodology. Four real-time PCR assays targeting 
C. auris and five real-time PCR assays targeting Cryptococcus spp. were applied 
with stool samples of 875 non-age-stratified Ghanaian HIV patients and 30 
Ghanaian control individuals without known HIV infection. Also, 664 samples from 
Ghanaian children under 2 years of age were investigated. The true abundance of 
the target micro-organism was considered as unlikely in the case of one or fewer 
positive signals, likely in the case of two to three positive signals and highly 
likely in the case of four or more positive signals per sample in the real-time 
PCR assays.Results. The combined application of sensitive, target-specific 
real-time PCR assays indicates that neither C. auris, Cryptococcus neoformans 
complex nor Cryptococcus gattii complex were part of the gut microbiota of 
Ghanaian individuals with or without HIV infection.Conclusion. Despite the 
significant disease burden from these pathogens in immunosuppressed Ghanaian 
individuals, detection from gastrointestinal samples was unlikely, which should 
be taken into account when discussing screening strategies for these fungi of 
public health concern. In contrast, the detection of these fungi from such 
samples should not routinely be considered as commensal colonization flora.

The resident microbiota are a key component of a healthy organism. The vast 
majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacterial members, which 
constitute a significant portion of resident microbial biomass. Recent studies 
have demonstrated how the fungal component of the microbiota, or the mycobiome, 
influences mammalian biology despite its low abundance compared to other 
microbes. Fungi are known for their pathogenic potential, yet fungi are also 
prominent colonizers in healthy states, highlighting their duality. We summarize 
the characteristics that define the gut mycobiome across life, the factors that 
can impact its composition, and studies that identify mechanisms of how fungi 
confer health benefits. The goal of this review is to synthesize our knowledge 
regarding the composition and function of a healthy mycobiome with a view to 
inspiring future therapeutic advances.

Candida spp. are members of the human mucosal microbiota that can cause 
opportunistic diseases ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening 
invasive candidiasis. In humans, the most common infection caused by Candida 
spp. is vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which affects >70% of women at least 
once in their lifetime. Of those women, ∼5%-10% develop recurrent VVC (RVVC). In 
this review, we summarize our current understanding of the host and fungal 
factors that contribute to susceptibility to VVC and RVVC. We synthesize key 
findings that support the notion that disease symptoms are driven by 
neutrophil-associated dysfunction and immunopathology and describe how 
antifungal immune mechanisms in the vagina are distinct from other mucosal 
barrier sites. Finally, we highlight key, unanswered research areas within the 
field that can help us better understand the immunopathogenesis of this 
infection and facilitate the development of novel preventive, therapeutic, 
and/or vaccination strategies to combat these common, poorly understood 
diseases.

Myeloid phagocytes are essential for antifungal immunity against pulmonary 
Aspergillus fumigatus and systemic Candida albicans infections. However, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying fungal clearance by phagocytes remain 
incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of perforin-2 
(Mpeg1) in antifungal immunity. We found that Mpeg1 -/- mice generated on a 
mixed C57BL/6J-DBA/2 background exhibited enhanced survival, reduced lung fungal 
burden, and greater neutrophil fungal killing activity compared to wild-type 
C57BL/6J (B6) mice, suggesting that perforin-2 may impair antifungal immune 
responses. However, when we compared Mpeg1 -/- mice with co-housed Mpeg +/+ 
littermate controls, these differences were no longer observed, indicating that 
initial findings were likely influenced by differences in the murine genetic 
background or the microbiota composition. Furthermore, perforin-2 was 
dispensable for antifungal immunity during C. albicans bloodstream infection. 
These results suggest that perforin-2 is not essential for host defense against 
fungal infections in otherwise immune competent mice and highlight the 
importance of generating co-housed littermate controls to minimize murine 
genetic and microbiota-related factors in studies of host defense mechanisms.

Leaf surface microbial communities play an important role in forest ecosystems 
and are known to be affected by environmental and host conditions, including 
diseases impacting the host. Phytophthora agathidicida is a soil-borne pathogen 
that causes severe disease (kauri dieback) in one of New Zealand's endemic 
trees, Agathis australis (kauri). This research characterised the microbial 
communities of the A. australis phyllosphere (i.e. leaf surface) using modern 
molecular techniques and explored the effects of P. agathidicida on those 
communities. Fresh leaves were collected from trees where P. agathidicida was 
and was not detected in the soil and characterisation of the leaf surface 
microbial community was carried out via high-throughput amplicon sequencing of 
the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S ribosomal RNA regions. Nutrients 
in leaf leachates were also measured to identify other possible drivers of 
microbial diversity. The dominant phyllosphere microbial phylum was 
Proteobacteria followed by Acidobacteria. The phyllosphere microbial richness of 
A. agathis associated with P. agathidicida-infected soils was found to be 
generally lower than where the pathogen was not detected for both prokaryote 
(bacterial) and fungal phyla. Leaf leachate pH as well as boron and silicon had 
significant associations with bacterial and fungal community structure. These 
findings contribute to the development of a comprehensive understanding of A. 
australis leaf surface microbial communities and the effects of the soil 
pathogen P. agathidicida on those communities.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory diseases impose an immense health burden worldwide. 
Epidemiological studies have revealed extensive disparities in the incidence and 
severity of respiratory tract infections between men and women. It has been 
hypothesized that there might also be a nasal microbiome axis contributing to 
the observed sex disparities.
RESULTS: Here, we study the nasal microbiome of healthy young adults in the 
largest cohort to date with 1593 individuals, using shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing. We compile the most comprehensive reference catalog for the nasal 
bacterial community containing 4197 metagenome-assembled genomes and integrate 
the mycobiome, to provide a valuable resource and a more holistic perspective 
for the understudied human nasal microbiome. We systematically evaluate sex 
differences and reveal extensive sex-specific features in both taxonomic and 
functional levels in the nasal microbiome. Through network analyses, we capture 
markedly higher ecological stability and antagonistic potentials in the female 
nasal microbiome compared to the male's. The analysis of the keystone bacteria 
reveals that the sex-dependent evolutionary characteristics might have 
contributed to these differences.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we construct the most comprehensive catalog of 
metagenome-assembled-genomes for the nasal bacterial community to provide a 
valuable resource for the understudied human nasal microbiome. On top of that, 
comparative analysis in relative abundance and microbial co-occurrence networks 
identify extensive sex differences in the respiratory tract community, which may 
help to further our understanding of the observed sex disparities in the 
respiratory diseases.

Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing is commonly used to evaluate microbiome 
profiles in health and disease and document the impact of interventional 
treatments. Nanopore sequencing is attractive since it can provide greater 
classification at the species level. However, optimized protocols to target 
marker genes for bacterial and fungal profiling are needed. To achieve an 
increased taxonomic resolution, we developed extraction and full-length amplicon 
PCR-based approaches using Nanopore sequencing. Three lysis conditions were 
applied to a mock microbial community, including known bacterial and fungal 
species: ZymoBIOMICS lysis buffer (ML) alone, incorporating bead-beating (MLB) 
or bead-beating plus MetaPolyzyme enzymatic treatment (MLBE). In profiling of 
bacteria in comparison to reference data, MLB had more statistically different 
bacterial phyla and genera than the other two conditions. In fungal profiling, 
MLB had a significant increase of Ascomycota and a decline of Basidiomycota, 
subsequently failing to detect Malassezia and Cryptococcus. Also, a principal 
coordinates analysis plot by the Bray-Curtis metric showed a significant 
difference among groups for bacterial (P=0.033) and fungal (P=0.012) profiles, 
highlighting the importance of understanding the biases present in pretreatment. 
Overall, microbial profiling and diversity analysis revealed that ML and MLBE 
are more similar than MLB for both bacteria and fungi; therefore, using this 
specific pipeline, bead-beating is not recommended for whole gene amplicon 
sequencing. However, ML alone was suggested as an optimal approach considering 
DNA yield, taxonomic classification, reagent cost and hands-on time. This could 
be an initial proof-of-concept study for simultaneous human bacterial and fungal 
microbiome studies.

Root-knot nematodes (RKNs) of the genus Meloidogyne are one of the most damaging 
genera to cultivated woody plants with a worldwide distribution. The knowledge 
of the soil and rhizosphere microbiota of almonds infested with Meloidogyne 
could help to establish new sustainable and efficient management strategies. 
However, the soil microbiota interaction in deciduous woody plants infected with 
RKNs is scarcely studied. This research was carried out in six commercial almond 
groves located in southern Spain and infested with different levels of 
Meloidogyne spp. within each grove. Several parameters were measured: nematode 
assemblages, levels and biocontrol agents in Meloidogyne's eggs, levels of 
specific biocontrol agents in rhizoplane and soil, levels of bacteria and fungi 
in rhizoplane and soil, fungal and bacterial communities by high-throughput 
sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and 16S rRNA gene in soil and 
rhizosphere of the susceptible almond hybrid rootstock GF-677 infested with 
Meloidogyne spp. The studied almond groves showed soil degradation by nematode 
assemblies and fungi:bacterial ratio. Fungal parasites of Meloidogyne eggs were 
found in 56.25% of the samples. However, the percentage of parasitized eggs by 
fungi ranged from 1% to 8%. Three fungal species were isolated from Meloidogyne 
eggs, specifically Pochonia chlamydosporia, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and 
Trichoderma asperellum. The diversity and composition of the microbial 
communities were more affected by the sample type (soil vs rhizosphere) and by 
the geographical location of the samples than by the Meloidogyne density, which 
could be explained by the vigorous hybrid rootstock GF-677 and a possible 
dilution effect. However, the saprotrophic function in the functional guilds of 
the fungal ASV was increased in the highly infected roots vs the low infected 
roots. These results indicate that the presence of biocontrol agents in almond 
fields and the development of new management strategies could increase their 
populations to control partially RKN infection levels.

Seed microbial communities have been known to have a crucial role in the life 
cycle of a plant. In this study, we examined the distribution of the fungal 
communities in three compartments (husk, brown rice, and milled rice) of the 
fourteen rice seed samples. Ten fungal genera distributed throughout the three 
compartments of the rice seeds were identified as the core mycobiome of the rice 
seeds, regardless of collecting regions or cultivars. Based on the diversity 
analysis, the distribution of the fungal community in milled rice was found to 
be more diversified, evenly distributed, and differently clustered from the 
other two compartments. Among the core mycobiome, Moesziomyces dominated almost 
80% of the fungal communities in the outer compartments of rice seeds, whereas 
the abundances of other endophytic pathogenic fungi declined. Our results 
provide that antagonistic yeast Moesziomyces may be able to control the 
endogenous pathogenic fungal communities in rice seeds, hence maintaining the 
quality of rice seeds. In addition, the distribution of fungal communities 
differs depending on the rice seed's compartment, indicating that the 
compartment can affect the distribution of the seed microbial community.

Microbial assemblages naturally living on the skin are an integral part of 
immunity. In amphibians, this skin microbiota may hold a mitigation solution 
against the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes 
the panzootic disease chytridiomycosis. We used 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to 
test the adaptive microbiome hypothesis. We compared the community composition, 
richness, and putative Bd-inhibitory function of the skin microbiome of three 
amphibian host species in the Pyrenees, as well as three species in Taiwan, in 
both Bd-positive and negative mountain populations. In both geographical 
regions, the amphibian host species played a decisive role in shaping the 
microbial assemblage and putative anti-Bd properties. In the Pyrenees, the 
species most susceptible to chytridiomycosis, Alytes obstetricans, had the 
lowest relative abundances of putative protective bacteria. In Bd-positive and 
negative sites, individuals had different skin microbiomes, with all anuran 
species showing increased relative abundances of potential anti-Bd bacteria, 
while the Taiwanese caudata Hynobius sonani showed the opposite pattern. Our 
results suggest that, in response to exposure to the pathogen, the skin 
microbiota shifted to a defensive state with increased anti-Bd function, which 
may contribute to promoting disease resistance, as proposed by the adaptive 
microbiome hypothesis.

Penicillium expansum is a major postharvest pathogen of apples, causing loss in 
fruits through tissue damage, as well as in apple products due to contamination 
with the mycotoxin patulin. During infections, patulin is a cultivar-dependent 
virulence factor that facilitates apple lesion development. Patulin also has 
characterized antimicrobial activity and is important for inhibiting other 
competitive phytopathogens, but the role of this inhibitory activity has not 
been investigated in the context of the apple microbiome. In our current study, 
we isolated 68 apple microbiota and characterized their susceptibility to P. 
expansum extracts. We found Gram-negative bacteria and Basidiomycete yeast to 
demonstrate largely patulin-specific growth inhibition compared to Gram-positive 
and Ascomycete isolates. From co-cultures, we identified a Hanseniaspora and 
Gluconobacter pairing that reduced P. expansum biomass and found that 
Hanseniaspora uvarum alone is sufficient to reduce apple disease progression in 
vivo. We investigated possible mechanisms of H. uvarum biocontrol activity and 
found modest inhibition on apple puree plates, as well as a trend toward lower 
patulin levels at the wound site. Active biocontrol activity required live 
yeast, which also were effective in controlling Botrytis cinerea apple 
infections. Lastly, we explored the breadth of H. uvarum biocontrol activity 
with over 30 H. uvarum isolates and found consistent inhibition of P. expansum 
apple disease.

The use of compounds produced by hosts or symbionts for defence against 
antagonists has been identified in many organisms, including in fungus-farming 
termites (Macrotermitinae). The obligate mutualistic fungus Termitomyces plays a 
pivotal role in plant biomass decomposition and as the primary food source for 
these termites. Despite the isolation of various specialized metabolites from 
different Termitomyces species, our grasp of their natural product repertoire 
remains incomplete. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive 
analysis of 39 Termitomyces genomes, representing 21 species associated with 
members of five termite host genera. We identified 754 biosynthetic gene 
clusters (BGCs) coding for specialized metabolites and categorized 660 BGCs into 
61 biosynthetic gene cluster families (GCFs) spanning five compound classes. 
Seven GCFs were shared by all 21 Termitomyces species and 21 GCFs were present 
in all genomes of subsets of species. Evolutionary constraint analyses on the 25 
most abundant GCFs revealed distinctive evolutionary histories, signifying that 
millions of years of termite-fungus symbiosis have influenced diverse 
biosynthetic pathways. This study unveils a wealth of non-random and largely 
undiscovered chemical potential within Termitomyces and contributes to our 
understanding of the intricate evolutionary trajectories of biosynthetic gene 
clusters in the context of long-standing symbiosis.

The dynamics of the gut mycobiome and its association with cardiometabolic 
health remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ internal transcribed spacer 
(ITS) sequencing to capture the gut mycobiome composition and dynamics within a 
nationwide human cohort of 12,641 Chinese participants, including 1,946 
participants with repeated measurements across three years. We find that the gut 
mycobiome is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and related biomarkers in 
both cross-sectional and dynamic analyses. Fungal alpha diversity indices and 19 
mycobiome genera are the major contributors to the mycobiome-cardiometabolic 
disease link. Particularly, Saccharomyces emerges as an effect modifier of 
traditional risk factors in promoting type 2 diabetes risk. Further integration 
of multi-omics data reveals key metabolites such as γ-linolenic acid and 
L-valine linking the gut mycobiome to type 2 diabetes. This study advances our 
understanding of the potential roles of the gut mycobiome in cardiometabolic 
health.

PURPOSE: Chronic wounds caused by infections impose a considerable global 
healthcare burden. The microbial features of these infections and possible 
correlations between bacteria and fungi may influence wound healing. However, 
metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analyses of these features remain 
sparse. Therefore, we performed mNGS on chronic wound infection samples to 
investigate features and correlations between the bacteriome and mycobiome in 66 
patients (28: chronic wounds; 38: non-chronic wounds).
METHODS: Microbial community characteristics in patients with wound infections, 
microbiome-systemic inflammation associations, and bacteria-fungi correlations 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: Infections constituted the primary cause of wounds in this study. 
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (23%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%) were the 
most common pathogens associated with chronic wounds, whereas Staphylococcus 
aureus (15%) was the most prevalent in non-chronic wound infections. Patients 
with chronic wound infections had a higher abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
than those without chronic wounds. Microbes with a high relative abundance in 
chronic wound infections were less significantly associated with plasma 
inflammatory factors than those in non-chronic wound infections. Additionally, a 
positive correlation between Candida glabrata and P. aeruginosa and an 
association between Malassezia restricta and anaerobic species were detected in 
patients with chronic wound infections.
CONCLUSION: Our results further support the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa is a 
microbial biomarker of chronic wound infection regardless of the causative 
pathogens. Moreover, we propose a positive correlation between C. glabrata and 
P. aeruginosa in chronic wound infections, which advances the current 
understanding of fungi-bacteria correlations in patients with chronic wound 
infections.

Until recently, the data on the diversity of the entire microbial community from 
the Baltic Sea were relatively rare and very scarce. However, modern molecular 
methods have provided new insights into this field with interesting results. 
They can be summarized as follows. (i) Although low salinity causes a reduction 
in the biodiversity of multicellular species relative to the populations of the 
North-East Atlantic, no such reduction occurs in bacterial diversity. (ii) Among 
cyanobacteria, the picocyanobacterial group dominates when considering gene 
abundance, while filamentous cyanobacteria dominate in means of biomass. (iii) 
The diversity of diatoms and dinoflagellates is significantly larger than 
described a few decades ago; however, molecular studies on these groups are 
still scarce. (iv) Knowledge gaps in other protistan communities are evident. 
(v) Salinity is the main limiting parameter of pelagic fungal community 
composition, while the benthic fungal diversity is shaped by water depth, 
salinity, and sediment C and N availability. (vi) Bacteriophages are the 
predominant group of viruses, while among viruses infecting eukaryotic hosts, 
Phycodnaviridae are the most abundant; the Baltic Sea virome is contaminated 
with viruses originating from urban and/or industrial habitats. These features 
make the Baltic Sea microbiome specific and unique among other marine 
environments.

Diverse bacterial and fungal microbiota communities inhabit the human body, and 
their presence is essential for maintaining host homeostasis. The oral cavity, 
lung, gut, and vagina are just a few of the bodily cavities where these 
microorganisms communicate with one another, either directly or indirectly. The 
effects of this interaction can be either useful or detrimental to the host. 
When the healthy microbial diversity is disturbed, for instance, as a result of 
prolonged treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, this allows the growth of 
specific microbes at the expense of others and alters their pathogenicity, 
causing a switch of commensal germs into pathogenic germs, which could promote 
tissue invasion and damage, as occurs in immunocompromised patients. 
Consequently, antimicrobials that specifically target pathogens may help in 
minimizing secondary issues that result from the disruption of useful 
bacterial/fungal interactions (BFIs). The interface between Candida albicans and 
Aspergillus fumigatus with bacteria at various body sites is emphasized in the 
majority of the medically important BFIs that have been reported thus far. This 
interface either supports or inhibits growth, or it enhances or blocks the 
generation of virulence factors. The aim of this review is to draw attention to 
the link between the bacterial and fungal microbiota and how they contribute to 
both normal homeostasis and disease development. Additionally, recent research 
that has studied microbiota as novel antimicrobials is summarized.

Fungal lung disease encompasses a wide spectrum of organisms and associated 
clinical conditions, presenting a significant global health challenge. The type 
and severity of disease are determined by underlying host immunity and infecting 
fungal strain. The most common group of diseases are associated with the 
filamentous fungus Aspergillus species and include allergic bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis, sensitisation, aspergilloma and chronic and invasive pulmonary 
aspergillosis. Fungal lung disease remains epidemiologically heterogenous and is 
influenced by geography, environment and host comorbidities. Diagnostic 
modalities continue to evolve and now include novel molecular assays and 
biomarkers; however, persisting challenges include achieving rapid and accurate 
diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings, and in differentiating 
fungal infection from other pulmonary conditions. Treatment strategies for 
fungal lung diseases rely mainly on antifungal agents but the emergence of 
drug-resistant strains poses a substantial global threat and adds complexity to 
existing therapeutic challenges. Emerging antifungal agents and increasing 
insight into the lung mycobiome may offer fresh and personalised approaches to 
diagnosis and treatment. Innovative methodologies are required to mitigate drug 
resistance and the adverse effects of treatment. This state-of-the-art review 
describes the current landscape of fungal lung disease, highlighting key 
clinical insights, current challenges and emerging approaches for its diagnosis 
and treatment.

Uropygial gland secretions of birds consist of host and bacteria derived 
compounds and play a major sanitary and feather-protective role. Here we report 
on our microbiome studies of the New Guinean toxic bird Pachycephala schlegelii 
and the isolation of a member of the Amycolatopsis genus from the uropygial 
gland secretions. Bioactivity studies in combination with co-cultures, MALDI 
imaging and HR-MS/MS-based network analyses unveil the basis of its activity 
against keratinolytic bacteria and fungal skin pathogens. We trace the 
protective antimicrobial activity of Amycolatopsis sp. PS_44_ISF1 to the 
production of rifamycin congeners, ciromicin A and of two yet unreported 
compound families. We perform NMR and HR-MS/MS studies to determine the relative 
structures of six members belonging to a yet unreported lipopeptide family of 
pachycephalamides and of one representative of the demiguisins, a new 
hexapeptide family. We then use a combination of phylogenomic, transcriptomic 
and knock-out studies to identify the underlying biosynthetic gene clusters 
responsible for the production of pachycephalamides and demiguisins. Our 
metabolomics data allow us to map molecular ion features of the identified 
metabolites in extracts of P. schlegelii feathers, verifying their presence in 
the ecological setting where they exert their presumed active role for hosts. 
Our study shows that members of the Actinomycetota may play a role in avian 
feather protection.

This letter emphasizes the need to expand discussions on gut microbiome's role 
in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) by including the 
often-overlooked non-bacterial components of the human gut flora. It highlights 
how viral, fungal and archaeal inhabitants of the gut respond towards gut 
dys-biosis and contribute to disease progression. Viruses such as bacteriophages 
target certain bacterial species and modulate the immune system. Other viruses 
found associated include Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus, John 
Cunningham virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex virus type 6. Fungi 
such as Candida albicans and Malassezia contribute by forming tissue-invasive 
filaments and producing inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Archaea, mainly 
metha-nogens are also found altering the microbial fermentation pathways. This 
corres-pondence, thus underscores the significance of considering the 
pathological and physiological mechanisms of the entire spectrum of the gut 
microbiota to develop effective therapeutic interventions for both IBD and CRC.

The root-knot nematode (RKN) causes significant yield loss in tomatoes. 
Understanding the interaction of biocontrol agents (BCAs)-nematicides-soil 
microbiomes and RKNs is essential for enhancing the efficacy of biocontrol 
agents and nematicides to curb RKN damage to crops. The present study aimed to 
evaluate the in vitro effectiveness of BACa and nematicide against RKN and to 
apply the amplicon sequencing to assess the interaction of Bacillus velezensis 
(VB7) and Trichoderma koningiopsis (TK) against RKNs. Metagenomic analysis 
revealed the relative abundance of three phyla such as Proteobacteria (42.16%), 
Firmicutes (19.57%), and Actinobacteria (17.69%) in tomato rhizospheres. Those 
tomato rhizospheres treated with the combined application of B. velezensis 
VB7 + T. koningiopsis TK and RKN had a greater frequency of diversity and 
richness than the control. RKN-infested tomato rhizosphere drenched with 
bacterial and fungal antagonists had the maximum diversity index of bacterial 
communities. A strong correlation with a maximum number of interconnection edges 
in the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria was evident in soils 
treated with both B. velezensis VB7 and T. koningiopsis TK challenged against 
RKN in infected soil. The present study determined a much greater diversity of 
bacterial taxa observed in tomato rhizosphere soils treated with B. velezensis 
VB7 and T. koningiopsis TK than in untreated soil. It is suggested that the 
increased diversity and abundance of bacterial communities might be responsible 
for increased nematicidal properties in tomato plants. Hence, the combined 
applications of B. velezensis VB7 and T. koningiopsis TK can enhance the 
nematicidal action to curb RKN infecting tomatoes.

The currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant, while causing mild 
respiratory symptoms, exhibits high transmissibility, drug resistance, and 
immune evasion. We investigated whether the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 affected 
the dynamics of fecal microbial composition isolated in culture in moderate 
COVID-19 patients. Blood, stool, and medical records were collected from 50 
patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were taken per 
patient, at disease onset (within 5 days) and after symptom resolution (30-35 
days). The part of the gut microbiota identifiable using MALDI-TOF MS was 
analyzed, and inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured in serum. 
The analysis identified 566 isolates at the species level, including 83 
bacterial and 9 fungal species. Our findings indicate a change in the gut 
microbiota composition isolated in culture during the initial phase of 
infection, characterized by the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria such as 
Enterococcus spp. and Citrobacter spp., at the expense of beneficial commensal 
bacteria from the genus Bacillus and Lactobacillus. Additionally, the enrichment 
of fungal pathogens in fecal samples collected 30 days after the cessation of 
disease symptoms might suggest a prolonged disruption of the gut microbiota even 
after the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. This study contributes to a growing 
body of evidence on the systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the 
importance of considering gastrointestinal involvement in the management and 
treatment of COVID-19.

Differences in the cervicovaginal microbiome may influence the persistence of 
HPV and therefore, the progression to cervical cancer. We aimed to analyze and 
compare the metatranscriptome of cervical cancers positive for HPV 16 and 18 
with those positive for other HPV types to understand the microbiome's influence 
on oncogenicity. RNA sequencing data from a total of 222 invasive cervical 
cancer cases (HPV16/18 positive (n=42) and HPV "Other types" (n=180)) were 
subjected to taxonomy classification (Kraken 2) including bacteria, virus and 
fungi to the level of species. With a median depth of 288,080.5 reads per 
sample, up to 107 species (38 bacterial, 16 viral and 53 fungal) were 
identified. Diversity analyses revealed no significant differences in viral or 
fungal species between HPV16/18 and other HPV types. Bacterial alpha diversity 
was significantly higher in the "Other HPV types" group for the Observed index 
(p=0.0074) (but not for Shannon). Cumulative species curves revealed greater 
species diversity in the "Other HPV types" group compared to "HPV16/18 but no 
significant differences in species abundance were found between HPV groups. The 
study did not detect strong significant microbiome differences between HPV 16/18 
and other HPV types in cervical cancers. Further research is necessary to 
explore potential factors influencing the oncogenicity of different HPV types 
and their interaction with the cervical microbiome.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a large-vessel disease with high mortality, 
characterized by complex pathogenic mechanisms. Current therapeutic approaches 
remain insufficient to halt its progression. Fungi are important members of the 
gut microbiota. However, their characteristic alterations and roles in AAA 
remain unclear. This study investigated the role of gut fungal communities in 
the development of AAA through metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from 31 
healthy individuals and 33 AAA patients. We observed significant dysbiosis in 
the gut mycobiomes of AAA patients compared to healthy individuals, 
characterized by an increase in pathogenic fungi like Candida species and a 
decrease in beneficial yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The changes in 
fungal populations correlated strongly with clinical indicators of AAA, 
highlighting their potential for diagnosing and predicting AAA progression. 
Furthermore, our animal experiments demonstrated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
significantly ameliorated pathological alterations in AAA mice, suggesting a 
protective role for specific yeast strains against AAA development. These 
findings underscore the significant impact of gut mycobiomes on AAA and suggest 
that modulating these fungal communities could offer a novel therapeutic 
approach. Our research advances the understanding of the influence of gut 
microbiome on vascular diseases and suggests potential non-surgical approaches 
for managing AAA. By elucidating the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of gut 
fungi in AAA, this study provided important clues for future clinical strategies 
and therapeutic developments in the field of vascular medicine.
IMPORTANCE: Our research highlights the crucial role of gut fungi in abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. By analyzing fecal samples from AAA patients 
and healthy controls, we discovered significant dysbiosis in gut fungal 
communities, characterized by an increase in harmful Candida species and a 
decrease in beneficial yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This dysbiosis was 
correlated with the severity of AAA. Importantly, in animal experiments, 
supplementing with Saccharomyces cerevisiae significantly slowed AAA 
progression. These findings suggest that modulating gut fungi may offer a novel, 
non-surgical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of AAA, potentially 
reducing the need for invasive procedures.

BACKGROUND: The skin fungal communities of animals play a crucial role in 
maintaining host health and defending against pathogens. Because fungal 
infections can affect the skin microbiota of bats, gaining a comprehensive 
understanding of the characteristics of healthy bat skin fungal communities and 
the ecological processes driving them provides valuable insights into the 
interactions between pathogens and fungi.
METHODS: We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of 
Variance (PERMANOVA) to clarify differences in skin fungal community structure 
among bat species. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) based on a quasi-Poisson 
distribution and partial distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) was 
performed to assess the influence of variables on skin fungal communities. Using 
community construction models to explore the ecological processes driving fungal 
community changes, t-tests and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the alpha 
diversity and species abundance differences between the fungal structure on bat 
species' skin and the environmental fungal pool.
RESULTS: We found significant differences in the composition and diversity of 
skin fungal communities among bat species influenced by temperature, sampling 
site, and body mass index. Trophic modes and skin fungal community complexity 
also varied among bat species. Null model and neutral model analysis 
demonstrated that deterministic processes dominated the assembly of skin fungal 
communities, with homogeneous selection as the predominant process. Skin fungal 
communities on bat species were impacted by the environmental fungal reservoir, 
and actively selected certain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from the 
environmental reservoir to adhere to the skin.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we revealed the structure and the ecological process 
driving the skin fungal community across bat species in northern China. Overall, 
these results broaden our knowledge of skin fungal communities among bat 
species, which may be beneficial to potential strategies for the protection of 
bats in China.

BACKGROUND: Systemic inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines affects the skin 
microbiome; however, the impact of systemic anti-inflammatory therapy on the 
skin fungal microbiome is poorly understood. To examine the effects of cytokine 
inhibition on the fungal community on human skin and oral mucosa, we analyzed 
the composition of the skin mycobiome before and after IL-23 inhibition.
METHODS: The study enrolled 15 psoriasis patients. Swab samples were collected 
from the psoriasis-free skin of antecubital fossa, post-auricular, and the 
tongue surface before and after 16 weeks of treatment with anti-IL-23 
antibodies. Fungal DNA was sequenced by ITS1 metagenomic analysis, and taxonomic 
classification was performed.
RESULTS: Data from samples collected from the antecubital fossa revealed that 
the α diversity of the skin mycobiome decreased significantly after treatment 
with anti-IL-23 antibodies (p = 0.0120). Fungal DNAs were not amplified in 6/15 
swab samples after 16 weeks of IL-23 inhibition; by contrast, sufficiently 
detected in all 15 samples before treatment (p = 0.0554). A comparison of 9/15 
paired samples containing well-detected reads revealed that the percentage of 
genus Malassezia in the mycobiome fell significantly after treatment with IL-23 
inhibitors (before, 29.3% ± 9.9%; after; 8.5% ± 3.4%, p = 0.0137). The mycobiome 
on post-auricular skin and on the tongue surface showed no marked changes after 
IL-23 inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data suggest that inhibition of systemic IL-23 
provokes dysbiosis of the mycobiome at the antecubital fossa skin, a finding 
characterized by reduced fungal diversity and a reduction in the percentage of 
the genus Malassezia.

Major symbiotic organisms have evolved to establish beneficial relationships 
with hosts. However, understanding the interactions between symbionts and insect 
hosts, particularly for their roles in defense against pathogens, is still 
limited. In a previous study, we proposed that the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae 
can infect the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a harmful pest for rice 
crops. To expand on this, we investigated changes in N. lugens' intestinal 
commensal community after M. anisopliae infection and identified key gut 
microbiotas involved. Our results showed significant alterations in gut 
microbiota abundance and composition at different time points following 
infection with M. anisopliae. Notably, certain symbionts, like Acinetobacter 
baumannii, exhibited significant variations in response to the fungal infection. 
The decrease in these symbionts had a considerable impact on the insect host's 
survival. Interestingly, reintroducing A. baumannii enhanced the host's 
resistance to M. anisopliae, emphasizing its role in pathogen defense. 
Additionally, A. baumannii stimulated host immune responses, as evidenced by 
increased expression of immune genes after reintroduction. Overall, our findings 
highlight the significance of preserving a stable gut microbial community for 
the survival of insects. In specific conditions, the symbiotic microorganism A. 
baumannii can enhance the host's ability to resist entomopathogenic pathogens 
through immune regulation.

Grapes have been cultivated for wine production for millennia. Wine production 
involves a complex biochemical process where sugars in grape must are converted 
into alcohol and other compounds by microbial fermentation, primarily by the 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Commercially available S. cerevisiae strains are 
often used in winemaking, but indigenous (native) strains are gaining attention 
for their potential to contribute unique flavors. Recent advancements in 
high-throughput DNA sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of 
microbial communities during wine fermentation. Indeed, transcriptomic analysis 
of S. cerevisiae during wine fermentation has revealed a core gene expression 
program and provided insights into how this yeast adapts to fermentation 
conditions. Here, we assessed how the age of vines impacts the grape fungal 
microbiome and used transcriptomics to characterize microbial functions in grape 
must fermented with commercial and native S. cerevisiae. We discovered that 
~130-year-old Zinfandel vines harbor higher fungal loads on their grapes 
compared to 20-year-old Zinfandel vines, but fungal diversity is similar. 
Additionally, a comparison of inoculated and uninoculated fermentations showed 
distinct fungal dynamics, with uninoculated fermentations harboring the yeasts 
Metschnikowia and Pichia. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant 
differences in gene expression between fermentations inoculated and not 
inoculated with a commercial S. cerevisiae strain. Genes related to metabolism, 
stress response, and cell adhesion were differentially expressed, indicating 
varied functionality of S. cerevisiae in these fermentations. These findings 
provide insights into S. cerevisiae function during fermentation and highlight 
the potential for indigenous yeast to contribute to wine diversity.
IMPORTANCE: Understanding microbial functions during wine fermentation, 
particularly the role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is crucial for enhancing wine 
quality. While commercially available S. cerevisiae strains are commonly used, 
indigenous strains can offer unique flavors, potentially reflecting vineyard 
terroir. By leveraging high-throughput DNA sequencing and transcriptomic 
analysis, we explored the impact of vine age on the grape mycobiome and 
characterized microbial functions during grape fermentation. Our findings 
revealed that older vines harbor higher fungal loads, but fungal diversity 
remains similar across vine ages. Additionally, uninoculated fermentations 
exhibited diverse fungal dynamics, including the beneficial wine yeasts 
Metschnikowia and Pichia. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered significant 
differences in S. cerevisiae gene expression between inoculated and uninoculated 
fermentations, highlighting the potential of indigenous yeast to enhance wine 
diversity and inform winemaking practices.

The oral microbiome is a critical determinant of health and disease, as 
interactions between oral microorganisms can influence their physiology and the 
development or severity of oral infections. Lactobacilli have a widely 
recognized antagonistic relationship with Candida albicans and may exhibit 
probiotic properties that limit oral fungal infection. We previously reported 
that Lactobacillus johnsonii strain MT4, an oral strain isolated from C57BL/6 
mice, can induce global changes in the murine oral microbiome and has 
anti-Candida activity in vitro. To build on this information, we analyzed its 
abundance on the mouse oral mucosa, tested its impact on the severity and 
progression of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in a mouse model, and further 
explored the mechanism of antifungal activity in vitro. Our findings reveal that 
L. johnsonii MT4 is a dominant cultivable Lactobacillus in the oral mucosa of 
C57BL/6 mice. Strain MT4 has chitinase activity against C. albicans, which 
damages the cell wall and compromises fungal metabolic activity. Oral 
inoculation with strain MT4 causes a reduction in the Candida-induced rise in 
the abundance of oral enterococci and oral mucosal damage. This research 
underscores the potential of L. johnsonii strain MT4 as a novel probiotic agent 
in the prevention or management of OPC, and it contributes to a better 
understanding of the role of oral bacterial microbiota role in the pathogenesis 
of fungal infections.
IMPORTANCE: The interactions between the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans 
and resident oral bacteria are particularly crucial in maintaining oral health. 
Emerging antifungal drug-resistant strains, slow-paced drug discovery, and the 
risk of side effects can compromise the effectiveness of current treatments 
available for oropharyngeal candidiasis. This study advances the search for 
alternative microbiome-targeted therapies in oral fungal infections. We report 
that Lactobacillus johnsonii strain MT4 prevents the Candida-induced bloom of 
dysbiotic oral enterococci and reduces oral mucosal lesions in an oropharyngeal 
candidiasis murine model. We also show that this strain directly compromises the 
cell wall and reduces fungal metabolic activity, partly due to its chitinase 
activity.

The healthy cervicovaginal microbiota is dominated by various Lactobacillus 
species, which support a condition of eubiosis. Among their many functions, 
vaginal lactobacilli contribute to the maintenance of an acidic pH, produce 
antimicrobial compounds, and modulate the host immune response to protect 
against vaginal bacterial and fungal infections. Increasing evidence suggests 
that these beneficial bacteria may also confer protection against sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) caused by viruses such as human papillomavirus 
(HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Viral 
STIs pose a substantial public health burden globally, causing a range of 
infectious diseases with potentially severe consequences. Understanding the 
molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli exert their protective effects 
against viral STIs is paramount for the development of novel preventive and 
therapeutic strategies. This review aims to provide more recent insights into 
the intricate interactions between lactobacilli and viral STIs, exploring their 
impact on the vaginal microenvironment, host immune response, viral infectivity 
and pathogenesis, and highlighting their potential implications for public 
health interventions and clinical management strategies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The ocular surface is perpetually exposed to the 
external environment, rendering it susceptible to microbial contamination. The 
ocular surface microbiota consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit 
the conjunctiva and cornea. This study's objective was to extensively review the 
prevalence of bacterial and fungal organisms in the conjunctiva of healthy and 
diseased cats. (Herpes- and Calici-infected groups).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study was performed on 240 cats that had 
visited veterinary health centers (Tehran, Iran) for examination. Sterile swabs 
from each cat's eyes were investigated for microbiological assessment. After 
sample collection, viral pathogens (Herpes and Calici viruses) were isolated and 
identified using the PCR method. The ages of the investigated group were 3.76, 
3.93, and 4.15 months.
RESULTS: The highest frequency of bacteria in the normal, 
Herpes-infected/Calici-infected, and Herpes/Calici-infected groups were 
associated with Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus agalactiae, 
Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus intermedius, respectively. In 
addition, it was found that the high prevalence of fungal microorganisms in the 
isolated samples was related to yeasts, Aspergillus (Aspergillus fumigatus, 
Aspergillus niger), and Penicillium species.
CONCLUSION: Bacterial prevalence was significantly higher in all groups than the 
prevalence of fungi in the eyes of cats. The statistical comparison between the 
study groups regarding microbial and fungal frequency showed that significant 
differences were found between them, such that the frequency was higher in all 
disease groups, against the control group. In addition, a significant relation 
was observed between the Herpes-infected and Calici-infected groups regarding 
microbial and fungal prevalence.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by chronic microbial 
colonization and inflammation of the respiratory tract (RT), leading to 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) and lung damage. Although the lung bacterial 
microbiota has been extensively studied, the mycobiome remains understudied. 
However, its importance as a contributor to CF pathophysiology has been 
highlighted. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the 
current state of knowledge regarding the mycobiome, as described through 
NGS-based studies, in patients with CF (pwCF).Several studies have demonstrated 
that the mycobiome in CF lungs is a dynamic entity, exhibiting a lower diversity 
and abundance than the bacterial microbiome. Nevertheless, the progression of 
lung damage is associated with a decrease in fungal and bacterial diversity. The 
core mycobiome of the RT in pwCFs is mainly composed of yeasts (Candida spp., 
Malassezia spp.) and molds with lower abundance. Some fungi (Aspergillus, 
Scedosporium/Pseudallescheria) have been demonstrated to play a role in PEx, 
while the involvement of others (Candida, Pneumocystis) remains uncertain. The 
"climax attack" ecological model has been proposed to explain the complexity and 
interplay of microbial populations in the RT, leading to PEx and lung damage. 
NGS-based studies also enable the detection of intra- and interkingdom 
correlations between fungi and bacteria. Further studies are required to 
ascertain the biological and pathophysiological relevance of these correlations. 
Finally, with the recent advent of CFTR modulators, our understanding of the 
pulmonary microbiome and mycobiome in pwCFs is about to change.

Microbiomes play crucial roles in insect adaptation, especially under stress 
such as pathogen invasion. Yet, how beneficial microbiomes assemble remains 
unclear. The wood-boring beetle Monochamus alternatus, a major pest and vector 
of the pine wilt disease (PWD) nematode, offers a unique model. We conducted 
controlled experiments using amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS) within 
galleries where beetles and microbes interact. PWD significantly altered 
bacterial and fungal communities, suggesting distinct assembly processes. 
Deterministic factors like priority effects, host selection, and microbial 
interactions shaped microbiome composition, distinguishing healthy from 
PWN-infected galleries. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ophiostomataceae emerged 
as potentially beneficial, aiding beetle's development and pathogen resistance. 
This study unveils how nematode-induced changes in gallery microbiomes influence 
beetle's development, shedding light on microbiome assembly amid insect-pathogen 
interactions. Insights gleaned enhance understanding of PWD spread and suggest 
novel management strategies via microbiome manipulation.IMPORTANCEThis study

wood-boring beetles, Monochamus alternatus, a vector of the pine wilt disease 
(PWD). By conducting controlled comparison experiments and employing amplicon 
approaches, the study reveals significant changes in taxonomic composition and 
functional adaptation of bacterial and fungal communities induced by PWD. It 
identifies deterministic processes, including priority effects, host selection, 
and microbial interactions, as major drivers in microbiome assembly. 
Additionally, the study highlights the presence of potentially beneficial 
microbes such as Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ophiostomataceae, which could 
enhance beetle development and resistance to pathogens. These findings shed 
light on the intricate interplay among insects, microbiomes, and pathogens,

Plants associate with a wealth of microbes, collectively referred to as the 
plant microbiota, whose composition is determined by host plant genetics, immune 
responses, environmental factors and intermicrobial relations. Unsurprisingly, 
microbiota compositions change during disease development. Recent evidence 
revealed that some of these changes can be attributed to effector proteins with 
antimicrobial activities that are secreted by plant pathogens to manipulate host 
microbiota to their advantage. Intriguingly, many of these effectors have 
ancient origins, predating land plant emergence, and evolved over long 
evolutionary trajectories to acquire selective antimicrobial activities to 
target microbial antagonists in host plant microbiota. Thus, we argue that 
host-pathogen co-evolution likely involved arms races within the host-associated 
microbiota.

To address this issue, a comparative analysis of the microbiota of sand fly 
vector populations of Leishmania major and L. tropica in a mixed focus of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia was performed. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were used to characterize and 
compare the overall bacterial and fungal composition of field-collected sand 
flies: Phlebotomus papatasi, Ph. perniciosus, Ph. riouxi, and Ph. sergenti. 
Thirty-eight bacterial genera belonging to five phyla were identified in 117 
female specimens. The similarities and differences between the microbiome data 
from different samples collected from three collections were determined using 
principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Substantial variations in the bacterial 
composition were found between geographically distinct populations of the same 
sand fly species, but not between different species at the same location, 
suggesting that the microbiota content was structured according to environmental 
factors rather than host species. These findings suggest that host phylogeny may 
play a minor role in determining the insect gut microbiota, and its potential to 
affect the transmission of the Leishmania parasite appear to be very low. These 
results highlight the need for further studies to decode sand fly 
Leishmania-microbiota interactions, as even the same bacterial species, such as 
Enterococcus faecalis, can exert completely opposite effects when confronted 
with different pathogens within various host insects and vice versa.

Due to its nutritional value and health benefits, the date palm (Phoenix 
dactylifera L.) is an essential dietary food crop throughout Middle Eastern and 
African countries. Consumers are concerned about the possible microbial 
contamination of dates, especially since most dates arriving in local markets 
are unprocessed. The absence of processing increases the possibility of 
microbial contamination, which raises the probability of microbial 
contamination. This study aims to analyze and evaluate the variability of fungal 
and bacterial microbiota identified in the most popular date palm fruits in 
Saudi Arabia. The study assessed ten date variety fruits from the most popular 
date palm varieties for consumption in Saudi Arabia and analyzed the microbial 
count. Morphological and molecular characterization and comparison of nuclear 
ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences identified 78 fungi, 
including 36 distinct species across 15 fungal genera. Alternaria, Fusarium, 
Curvilaria, Aspergillus, and Penicillium were the most frequent genera among the 
ten fruit cultivars studied, according to ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. 
Furthermore, 36 bacterial isolates were obtained from ten date varieties 
studied, each with a unique colony morphology. These isolates were identified 
based on sequence alignment and comparison of their 16S rDNA internal spacer 
regions to those available in public databases. The results showed that the 
bacterial isolates included 15 species from five bacterial genera. The results 
suggested that Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Brucella were the prevailing 
genera among the ten tested fruit varieties. Some bacterial genera, such as 
Brucella, Achromobacter, and Stenotrophomonas, are well-known potential human 
pathogens. Chaetomium globosum was also recognized as air pollution causing 
adverse health effects such as allergies and as the causal agent of human fungal 
infections among the tested date varieties; the Rashodiah type exhibited the 
highest fungal contamination, whereas the Sagai variety displayed the lowest 
fungal contamination. Conversely, the Sukkari, Barhi, and Mejdool varieties were 
the most contaminated with bacteria among the ten tested varieties, while the 
Khalas variety showed the least bacterial contamination. To the best of the 
authors' knowledge, this study provides the initial comprehensive account of the 
molecular and morphological identification of all fungal and bacterial genera 
associated with date palm (P. dactylifera) fruits.

1. Candidemia.

Mora Carpio AL, Climaco A.

Jan–.
2024 Sep 2.

Candida spp are commensal yeasts that are normally found on human skin, in 
mucosal and intestinal microbiota, and in the mycobiome. Still, these fungi 
can become pathogenic and opportunistic if the appropriate circumstances are 
present. The human mycobiome makes up less than 0.1% of the intestinal 
microbiome, and up to 60% of people can be colonized with Candida 
spp. Candida spp can become pathogenic when the equilibrium between commensal 
organisms is disturbed, and risk factors for Candida spp overgrowth and 
invasiveness are present. Such risk factors include immunosuppression, the 
presence of central lines, and exposure to antibiotics. Candida spp can cause 
invasive and deep-seated candidiasis via the dissemination of Candida spp to 
sterile parts of the body, such as the peritoneum. Precise global 
epidemiological data is lacking, but studies from the United States report that 
candidemia is the fourth most common healthcare-associated bloodstream infection 
(BSI) and the most common fungal BSI in patients who are 
hospitalized. Candidemia is generally defined as the presence of Candida spp in 
the blood; more precisely, it is defined as the presence of Candida spp in "at 
least 1 positive blood culture from a peripheral or a central line." Candidemia 
is associated with poorer patient outcomes, longer hospital stays, and increased 
healthcare costs—and carries an attributable mortality rate that varies from 35% 
to 70%. Although C albicans is still the most common Candida species to cause 
candidemia, there has been an increased incidence of BSI with nonalbicans 
Candida spp, which have different epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility 
profiles. In addition, the emergence of C auris, presents a novel, 
multidrug-resistant Candida spp. This changing epidemiology can result in 
difficulties when selecting the correct antifungal medication, causing delays in 
treatment, which is associated with poor patient outcomes and higher 
attributable mortality. Managing candidemia should include immediate blood 
cultures, focus on the prompt selection and administration of appropriate 
antifungal therapy with adjustment of antifungals when necessary, removal of 
indwelling vascular devices if possible, documentation of clearing of blood 
cultures, and ensuring that the candidemia has not seeded remote sites, leading 
to complications.

BACKGROUND: Cabbage Fusarium wilt (CFW) is a devastating disease caused by the 
soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Foc). One of the 
optimal measures for managing CFW is the employment of tolerant/resistant 
cabbage varieties. However, the interplay between plant genotypes and the 
pathogen Foc in shaping the rhizosphere microbial community, and the consequent 
influence of these microbial assemblages on biological resistance, remains 
inadequately understood.
RESULTS: Based on amplicon metabarcoding data, we observed distinct differences 
in the fungal alpha diversity index (Shannon index) and beta diversity index 
(unweighted Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) within the rhizosphere of the YR 
(resistant to Foc) and ZG (susceptible to Foc) cabbage varieties, irrespective 
of Foc inoculation. Notably, the Shannon diversity shifts in the resistant YR 
variety were more pronounced following Foc inoculation. Disease-resistant plant 
variety demonstrate a higher propensity for harboring beneficial microorganisms, 
such as Pseudomonas, and exhibit superior capabilities in evading harmful 
microorganisms, in contrast to their disease-susceptible counterparts. 
Furthermore, the network analysis was performed on rhizosphere-associated 
microorganisms, including both bacteria and fungi. The networks of association 
recovered from YR exhibited greater complexity, robustness, and density, 
regardless of Foc inoculation. Following Foc infection in the YR rhizosphere, 
there was a notable increase in the dominant bacterium NA13, which is also a hub 
taxon in the microbial network. Reintroducing NA13 into the soil significantly 
improved disease resistance in the susceptible ZG variety, by directly 
inhibiting Foc and triggering defense mechanisms in the roots.
CONCLUSIONS: The rhizosphere microbial communities of these two cabbage 
varieties are markedly distinct, with the introduction of the pathogen eliciting 
significant alterations in their microbial networks which is correlated with 
susceptibility or resistance to soil-borne pathogens. Furthermore, we identified 
a rhizobacteria species that significantly boosts disease resistance in 
susceptible cabbages. Our results indicated that the induction of resistance 
genes leading to varied responses in microbial communities to pathogens may 
partly explain the differing susceptibilities of the cabbage varieties tested to 
CFW. Video Abstract.

Protocols to enable fluorescence microscopy of microbial interactions on living 
maize silks (style tissue).

There is interest in studying microbes that colonize maize silks (style tissue, 
critical for reproduction) including the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum 
(Fg) and its interactions with the microbiome and biocontrol agents. In planta 
imaging of these interactions on living silks using confocal fluorescence 
microscopy would provide key insights. However, newly discovered microbes have 
unknown effects on human health, and there are regulatory requirements to 
prevent the release of fluorescently tagged microbes into the environment. 
Therefore, the microbe infection, colonization, and interaction stages on silks 
prior to microscopy must be contained. At the same time, silk viability must be 
maintained and experiments conducted that are biologically relevant (e.g. silks 
should remain attached to the cob), yet the silk tissue must be accessible to 
the researcher (i.e. not within husk leaves) and allow for multiple replicates. 
Here we present methods that meet these five contrasting criteria. We tested 
these methods using Fg and four silk-derived bacterial endophytes. The 
endophytes were previously known to have anti-Fg activity in vitro, but in 
planta observations were lacking. In Method 1, a portion of the tip of a cob was 
dissected, and silks remained attached to the cob in a Petri dish. The cob was 
placed on a water agar disc to maintain hydration. DsRed-tagged bacteria and 
GFP-tagged Fg were inoculated onto the silks and incubated, allowing the two 
microbes to grow towards one another before staining with propidium iodide for 
confocal microscopy. A variation of the protocol was presented in Method 2, 
where detached silk segments were placed directly on water agar where they were 
inoculated with bacteria and Fg to promote dense colonization, and to allow for 
many replicates and interventions such as silk wounding. The bacterial 
endophytes were successfully observed colonizing Fg hyphae, silk trichomes, and 
entering silks via cut ends and wounds. These protocols can be used to study 
other silk-associated microbes including several globally important fungal 
pathogens that enter maize grain through silks.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
colitis, involves chronic inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. 
Oxidative stress, associated with increased reactive oxygen species generation, 
is a major risk factor for IBD pathogenesis. Industrialized lifestyles expose us 
to a variety of factors that contribute to deteriorating gut health, especially 
for IBD patients. Many alternative therapeutic strategies have been developed 
against oxidative stress along with conventional therapy to alleviate IBD 
pathogenesis. Polyphenol-rich foods have attracted growing interest from 
scientists due to their antioxidant properties. Polyphenols are natural 
compounds found in plants, fruits, vegetables, and nuts that exhibit antioxidant 
properties and protect the body from oxidative damage. This review presents an 
overview of polyphenol benefits and describes the different types of 
polyphenols. It also discusses polyphenols' role in inhibiting oxidative stress 
and fungal growth prevention. Overall, this review highlights how a healthy and 
balanced diet and avoiding the industrialized lifestyles of our modern society 
can minimize oxidative stress damage and protect against pathogen infections. It 
also highlights how polyphenol-rich foods play an important role in protecting 
against oxidative stress and fungal growth.

Irrigation practices and groundwater levels are critical factors contributing to 
soil salinization in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the impact of soil 
salinization resulting from Yellow River water irrigation and recharge on 
microbial communities and their functions in the Huinong District has not been 
thoroughly documented. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was 
employed to analyze the diversity, composition, and structure of bacterial and 
fungal communities across a gradient of salinized soils. The results indicated 
that the alpha diversity of bacterial communities was significantly higher in 
slightly saline soils compared to highly saline soils. Soil salinization notably 
influenced the composition of both bacterial and fungal communities. Highly 
salinized soils were enriched with bacterial taxa such as Halomonas, 
Salinimicrobium, Pseudomonas, Solibacillus, and Kocuria, as well as fungal taxa 
including Emericellopsis, Alternaria, and Podospora. In these highly saline 
soils, bacterial taxa associated with iron respiration, sulfur respiration, and 
hydrocarbon degradation were more prevalent, whereas fungal taxa linked to 
functions such as soil animal pathogens, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, 
endophytes, dung saprotrophy, leaf saprotrophy, soil saprotrophy, fungal 
parasitism, and plant pathogenicity were less abundant. Random forest analysis 
identified nine bacterial and eighteen fungal taxa as potential biomarkers for 
salinity discrimination in saline soils. Symbiotic network analysis further 
revealed that soil salinization pressure reduced the overall complexity and 
stability of bacterial and fungal communities. Additionally, bacterial community 
assembly showed a tendency shift from stochastic to deterministic processes in 
response to increasing salinity, while fungal community assembly remained 
dominated by deterministic processes. provide robust evidence that soil salinity 
is a major inhibitor of soil biogeochemical processes in the Huinong District 
and plays a critical role in shaping bacterial and fungal communities, their 
symbiotic networks, and their assembly processes.

The gut-lung axis: the impact of the gut mycobiome on pulmonary diseases and 
infections.

Sey EA(1), Warris A(1).

Exeter, EX4 4QD, UK.

The gastrointestinal tract contains a diverse microbiome consisting of bacteria, 
fungi, viruses and archaea. Although these microbes usually reside as commensal 
organisms, it is now well established that higher abundance of specific 
bacterial or fungal species, or loss of diversity in the microbiome can 
significantly affect development, progression and outcomes in disease. Studies 
have mainly focused on the effects of bacteria, however, the impact of other 
microbes, such as fungi, has received increased attention in the last few years. 
Fungi only represent around 0.1% of the total gut microbial population. However, 
key fungal taxa such as Candida, Aspergillus and Wallemia have been shown to 
significantly impact health and disease. The composition of the gut mycobiome 
has been shown to affect immunity at distal sites, such as the heart, lung, 
brain, pancreas, and liver. In the case of the lung this phenomenon is referred 
to as the 'gut-lung axis'. Recent studies have begun to explore and unveil the 
relationship between gut fungi and lung immunity in diseases such as asthma and 
lung cancer, and lung infections caused by viruses, bacteria and fungi. In this 
review we will summarize the current, rapidly growing, literature describing the 
impact of the gut mycobiome on respiratory disease and infection.

AIMS: The objective of this study was to elucidate the role and mechanism of 
changes in the rhizosphere microbiome following Arthrobotrys oligospora 
treatment in the biological control of root-knot nematodes and identify the key 
fungal and bacterial species that collaborate with A. oligospora to biocontrol 
root-knot nematodes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a pot experiment to investigate the impact of 
A. oligospora treatment on the biocontrol efficiency of A. oligospora against 
Meloidogyne incognita infecting tomatoes. We analyzed the rhizosphere bacteria 
and fungi communities of tomato by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA 
gene fragment and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS). The results indicated 
that the application of A. oligospora resulted in a 53.6% reduction in the 
disease index of M. incognita infecting tomato plants. The bacterial diversity 
of rhizosphere soil declined in the A. oligospora-treated group, while fungal 
diversity increased. The A. oligospora treatment enriched the tomato rhizosphere 
with Acidobacteriota, Firmicutes, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonadales, 
Glomeromycota, and Purpureocillium. These organisms are involved in the 
utilization of rhizosphere organic matter, nitrogen, and glycerolipids, or play 
the role of ectomycorrhiza or directly kill nematodes. The networks of bacterial 
and fungal co-occurrence exhibited a greater degree of stability and complexity 
in the A. oligospora treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the key fungal and bacterial species that 
collaborate with the A. oligospora in controlling the root-knot nematode and 
elaborated the potential mechanisms involved. The findings offer valuable 
insights and inspiration for the advancement of bionematicide based on 
nematode-trapping fungi.

Candida species primarily exist as harmless commensals in the gastrointestinal 
tract of warm-blooded animals. However, they can also cause life-threatening 
infections, which are often associated with gut microbial dysbiosis. Identifying 
the microbial actors that restrict Candida to commensalism remains a significant 
challenge. In vitro models could enable a mechanistic study of the interactions 
between Candida and simulated colon microbiomes. Therefore, this study aimed to 
elucidate the spatial and temporal colonization kinetics of specific Candida, 
including C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis, and their relative 
Nakaseomyces glabratus, by using an adapted SHIME® model, simulating the ileum, 
and proximal and distal colons. We monitored fungal and bacterial colonization 
kinetics under conditions of eubiosis (commensal lifestyle) and 
antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (pathogenic lifestyle). Our findings highlighted 
the variability in the colonization potential of Candida species across 
different intestinal regions. The ileum compartment proved to be the most 
favourable environment for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis under conditions of 
eubiosis. Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis resulted in resurgence of opportunistic 
Candida species, especially C. tropicalis and C. albicans. Future research 
should focus on identifying specific bacterial species influencing Candida 
colonization resistance and explore the long-term effects of antibiotics on the 
mycobiome and bacteriome.

The kiwifruit industry typically uses commercial pollen for artificial 
pollination. However, during the collection of male flowers and pollen 
production, pollen can be easily contaminated by pathogenic bacteria that cause 
diseases such as canker and flower rot. Consequently, it is crucial to 
understand the structure of the pollen microbial community. This study employed 
Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the fungal and 
bacterial composition in pollen samples from various regions in Shaanxi 
Province. Concurrently, potential pathogenic strains were isolated using 
traditional microbial isolation and cultivation techniques, and their molecular 
identification was performed through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A tieback test 
was conducted on healthy branches to verify the pathogenicity of the strains. 
The results revealed a rich diversity of fungi and bacteria in kiwifruit pollen. 
At the phylum level, pollen fungi were mainly distributed in Ascomycota, and 
bacteria were mainly distributed in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The dominant 
fungal genera were Mycosphaerella, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium; the dominant 
bacterial genera were Weissella, Pantoea, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas, 
respectively. Additionally, both Erwinia persicina and Pseudomonas fluorescens, 
isolated from pollen, exhibited high pathogenicity toward healthy kiwifruit 
branches. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the microbial 
diversity in commercial kiwifruit pollen used for mass pollination.

Pinewood nematodes (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) are destructive plant 
parasitic nematodes that cause pine wilt disease (PWD) by attacking the vascular 
systems of pine trees, resulting in widespread tree mortality. Research has 
shown that there are connections between nematode-associated microbes and PWD. 
Yet the variations in microbial communities across different geographic regions 
are not well-understood. In this study, we examined the bacterial and fungal 
communities associated with nematodes and infested wood collected from 34 sites 
across three vegetation zones in China, as well as samples from the United 
States, using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene amplicon 
sequencing. The predominant genera Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus were found in 
nematodes, and Acinetobacter was present in the wood of PWD-infected pine trees 
across China. Network analysis revealed that core bacterial taxa belonged to the 
Pseudomonadota and Actinomycetota phyla for the nematodes, whereas the 
Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota phyla were dominant in the infested wood. 
Identification of enriched key microbial taxa in nematodes and infested wood 
across vegetation zones indicates distinct biogeographic microbial community 
structures and key bacterial species. Although the nematode-associated bacterial 
community showed consistency across geographic distances, the similarity of the 
PWD pine trees' bacterial community decreased with distance, suggesting a 
spatial correlation with environmental variables. Our findings enhance our 
understanding of the microbiota associated with pinewood nematode (PWN) and 
offer valuable insights into PWD management.
IMPORTANCE: Our research uncovered specific bacteria and fungi linked to 
pinewood nematode (PWN) and infested wood in three different vegetation zones in 
China, as well as samples from the United States. This sheds light on the 
critical roles of certain microbial groups, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, 
and Stenotrophomonas, in influencing PWN fitness. Understanding these patterns 
provides valuable insights into the dynamics of PWN-associated microbiomes, 
offering potential strategies for managing pine wilt disease (PWD). We found 
significant correlations between geographic distance and similarity in bacterial 
communities in the infested wood, indicating a spatial influence on 
wood-associated microbial communities due to limited dispersal and localized 
environmental conditions. Further investigations of these spatial patterns and 
driving forces are crucial for understanding the ecological processes that shape 
microbial communities in complex ecosystems and, ultimately, for mitigating the 
transmission of PWN in forests.

Orius laevigatus (Hemiptera, Anthocoridae) is a generalist predator extensively 
used for the biocontrol of diverse agricultural pests. Previous studies on O. 
laevigatus have focused on the improvement of insect genetic traits, but little 
is known about its association with microbes, especially viruses that may 
influence its production and efficacy. More than 280 RNA viruses have been 
described in other Hemiptera insects, in line with the continuous discovery of 
insect-specific viruses (ISVs) boosted by next-generation sequencing. In this 
study, we characterized the repertoire of RNA viruses associated with O. 
laevigatus. Its virome comprises 27 RNA viruses, classified within fourteen 
viral families, of which twenty-three viruses are specific to O. laevigatus and 
four are likely associated with fungal microbiota. The analysis of viral 
abundance in five O. laevigatus populations confirmed the presence of 
simultaneous viral infections and highlighted the ubiquitous presence and high 
abundance of one solinvivirus and three totiviruses. Moreover, we identified 24 
non-retroviral endogenous viral elements (nrEVEs) in the genome of O. 
laevigatus, suggesting a long-term relationship between the host and its virome. 
Although no symptoms were described in the insect populations under study, the 
high diversity of viral species and the high abundance of certain RNA viruses 
identified indicate that RNA viruses may be significant for the applicability 
and efficacy of O. laevigatus in biocontrol programs.

When a pathogen invades a plant, it encounters a diverse microbiota with some 
members contributing to the health and growth of the plant host. So far, the 
relevance of interactions between pathogens and the plant microbiota are poorly 
understood; however, new lines of evidence suggest that pathogens play an 
important role in shaping the microbiome of their host during invasion. This 
review aims to summarize recent findings that document changes in microbial 
community composition during the invasion of filamentous pathogens in plant 
tissues. We explore the known mechanisms of interaction between plant pathogens 
and the host microbiota that underlie these changes, particularly the 
pathogen-encoded traits that are produced to target specific microbes. Moreover, 
we discuss the limitations of current strategies and shed light on new 
perspectives to study the complex interaction networks between filamentous 
pathogens and the plant microbiome.

OBJECTIVES: Microorganisms are likely present in continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) devices used daily. Considering the potential risk of infections 
among CPAP device users, here we aimed to compare the microbiomes in CPAP 
devices with those in nasal mucosal samples obtained from corresponding 
individuals using these devices.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at tertiary medical institutes. 
Samples were collected from the tubes and filters of CPAP devices and the nasal 
mucosa of corresponding individuals using these devices. Microbiomes and 
mycobiomes were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer 
region sequencing. Results were compared according to the sampling site and 
usage duration for each patient.
RESULTS: Overall, 27 paired human nasal mucosa and CPAP samples were analyzed. 
Bacteria were present in 7 of 27 tubes (29.6%) and 22 of 27 filters (81.5%). 
Fungi were present in 2 of the 27 tubes (7.4%) and 16 of the 27 filters (59.3%). 
Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla among all samples. 
Fungi were not detected in any of the nasal mucosal samples. However, 
Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were predominant in the CPAP filters and tube 
samples. No significant associations were identified among the results according 
to sampling site and usage duration.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria or fungi can be detected to some extent in CPAP samples 
even if the CPAP usage period is short. The association between respiratory 
infections and these microbiomes or mycobiomes was not investigated. Further 
research might be required to determine the risk posed by CPAP devices as a 
microbial contamination source.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is typically caused by a variety of pathogenic 
microorganisms. Traditional research often focuses on the infection of a few 
microorganisms, whereas metagenomic studies focus on the impact of the 
bacteriome and mycobiome on respiratory diseases. Reports on the virome 
characteristics of pediatric pneumonia remain relatively scarce.
METHODS: We employed de novo assembly and combined homology- and feature-based 
methods to characterize the respiratory virome in whole-genome DNA sequencing 
samples from oropharynx (OP) swabs, nasopharynx (NP) swabs, and bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluids (BALF) of children with pneumonia.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the alpha and beta diversity 
indexes, as well as in the composition of the oropharyngeal virome, between 
pneumonia cases and controls. We identified 1137 viral operational taxonomic 
units (vOTUs) with significant differences, indicating a preference of 
pneumonia-reduced vOTUs for infecting Prevotella, Neisseria, and Veillonella, 
whereas pneumonia-enriched vOTUs included polyomavirus, human adenovirus, and 
phages targeting Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Granulicatella, and Actinomyces. 
Comparative analysis revealed higher relative abundances and prevalence rates of 
pneumonia-enriched OP vOTUs in NP and BALF samples compared to pneumonia-reduced 
vOTUs. Additionally, virome analysis identified six pediatric patients with 
severe human adenovirus or polyomavirus infections, five of whom might have been 
undetected by targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into pediatric pneumonia respiratory 
viromes, highlighting frequent transmission of potentially pathogenic viruses 
and demonstrating virome analysis as a valuable adjunct for pathogen detection.

Chronic liver disease and its complications are a significant global health 
burden. Changes in fungal communities (mycobiome), an integral component of the 
gut microbiome, are associated with and contribute to the development of liver 
disease. Fungal dysbiosis can induce intestinal barrier dysfunction and allow 
fungal products to translocate to the liver causing progression of disease. This 
review explores recent progress in understanding the compositional and 
functional diversity of gut mycobiome signatures across different liver 
diseases. It delves into causative connections between gut fungi and liver 
diseases. We emphasize the significance of fungal translocation, with a 
particular focus on fungal-derived metabolites and immune cells induced by 
fungi, as key contributors to liver disease. Furthermore, we review the 
potential impact of the intrahepatic mycobiome on the progression of liver 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Trichosporon asahii (T. asahii) is part of the cutaneous fungal 
microbiota in humans and can cause lethal opportunistic infection. During 
infection, microorganisms can adapt to their environment by adjusting gene 
expression and cellular activities.
OBJECTIVES: Investigation of the microevolutionary changes in T. asahii during 
chronic infection.
METHODS: Two T. asahii strains were isolated from a chronic trichosporonosis 
patient between a 15-year interval, and the microevolutionary changes were 
compared by the immune response of dendritic cell (DC), mice survival model, and 
transcriptome sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with the primary T. asahii strain, the microevolved strain 
induced much lower expression of TNF-α by mice bone marrow-derived DC and had a 
much superior survival rate, a total of 2212 significantly differentially 
expressed genes were identified in the microevolved strain, and functional 
analysis showed significance in the downregulated transcription and metabolic 
process, especially the valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation pathways, 
which were associated with pathogenicity and virulence; hence, the results were 
highly consistent with the decreased immunogenicity and virulence of the 
microevolved strain.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that the microevolution during chronic 
infection could induce changes in immunogenicity, virulence, and transcriptome, 
which might lead T. asahii to coexist with the host.

The spread and adaptation of fungal plant pathogens in agroecosystems are 
facilitated by environmental homogeneity. Metagenomic sequencing of infected 
tissues allowed us to monitor eco-evolutionary dynamics and interactions between 
host, pathogen and plant microbiome. Exserohilum turcicum, the causal agent of 
northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) in maize, is distributed in multiple clonal 
lineages throughout Europe. To characterize regional pathogen diversity, we 
conducted metagenomic DNA sequencing on 241 infected leaf samples from the 
highly susceptible Swiss maize landrace Rheintaler Ribelmais, collected over 
3 years (2016-2018) from an average of 14 agricultural farms within the Swiss 
Rhine Valley. All major European clonal lineages of E. turcicum were identified. 
Lineages differ by their mating types which indicates potential for sexual 
recombination and rapid evolution of new pathogen strains, although we found no 
evidence of recent recombination. The associated eukaryotic and prokaryotic leaf 
microbiome exhibited variation in taxonomic diversity between years and 
locations and is likely influenced by local weather conditions. A network 
analysis revealed distinct clusters of eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa that 
correlates with the frequency of E. turcicum sequencing reads, suggesting causal 
interactions. Notably, the yeast genus Metschnikowia exhibited a strongly 
negative association with E. turcicum, supporting its known potential as 
biological control agent against fungal pathogens. Our findings show that 
metagenomic sequencing is a useful tool for analysing the role of environmental 
factors and potential pathogen-microbiome interactions in shaping pathogen 
dynamics and evolution, suggesting their potential for effective pathogen 
management strategies.

BACKGROUND: The interplay between root-knot nematode (RKN) parasitism and the 
complex web of host-associated microbiota has been recognized as pivotal for 
effective management of the pest. However, studies assessing this relationship 
have focussed on the bacterial and fungal communities, neglecting the 
unicellular eukaryotic members. Here, we employed amplicon sequencing analysis 
of the bacterial 16S rRNA, fungal ITS and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes, and 
comprehensively examined how the microbiome composition, diversity and 
networking developed with time in the rhizospheres and roots of RKN-inoculated 
and non-inoculated tomato plants.
RESULTS: As expected, infection with the RKN Meloidogyne incognita decreased 
plant growth. At individual timepoints, we found distinct bacterial, fungal and 
eukaryote community structures in the RKN-inoculated and non-inoculated 
rhizospheres and roots, and RKN inoculation affected several taxa in the 
root-associated microbiome differentially. Correlation analysis revealed several 
bacterial and fungal and few protist taxa that correlated negatively or 
positively with M. incognita. Moreover, network analysis using bacterial, fungal 
and eukaryotic data revealed more dynamic networks with higher robustness to 
disturbances in the RKN-inoculated than in the non-inoculated 
rhizospheres/roots. Hub taxa displayed a noticeable successional pattern that 
coincided with different phases of M. incognita parasitism. We found that fungal 
hubs had strong negative correlations with bacteria and eukaryotes, while 
positive correlations characterized hub members within individual kingdoms.
CONCLUSION: Our results reveal dynamic tomato-associated microbiomes that 
develop along different trajectories in plants suffering M. incognita 
infestation and non-infested plants. Overall, the results identify stronger 
associations between RKN and bacterial and fungal taxa than between eukaryotic 
taxa and RKN, suggesting that fungal and bacterial communities could play a 
larger role in the regulation of RKN. The study identifies several putative 
RKN-antagonistic bacterial and fungal taxa and confirms the antagonistic 
potential previously identified in other taxa.

The oral cavity remains an underappreciated site for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
despite the myriad of oral conditions in COVID-19 patients. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 
was shown to replicate in the salivary gland cells causing tissue inflammation. 
Given the established association between inflammation and microbiome 
disruption, we comparatively profiled oral microbial differences at a 
metagenomic level in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and matched 
healthy controls. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate colonization by the 
opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the etiologic agent of oral 
candidiasis. Comprehensive shotgun metagenomic analysis indicated that, overall, 
COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly reduced bacterial and viral 
diversity/richness; we identified 12 differentially abundant bacterial species 
to be negatively associated with COVID-19, and the functional pathways of 
certain bacteria to be highly associated with COVID-19 status. Strikingly, C. 
albicans was recovered from approximately half of the COVID-19 subjects but not 
from any of the healthy controls. The prevalence of Candida is likely linked to 
immune hypo-dysregulation caused by COVID-19 favoring Candida proliferation, 
warranting investigations into the interplay between Candida and SARS-CoV2 and 
potential therapeutic approaches directed toward oral candidiasis. Collectively, 
our findings prompt a reassessment of oral opportunistic infection risks during 
COVID-19 disease and their potential long-term impacts on oral health.

The human gastrointestinal ecosystem, or microbiome (comprising the total 
bacterial genome in an environment), plays a crucial role in influencing host 
physiology, immune function, metabolism, and the gut-brain axis. While bacteria, 
fungi, viruses, and archaea are all present in the gastrointestinal ecosystem, 
research on the human microbiome has predominantly focused on the bacterial 
component. The colonization of the human intestine by microbes during the first 
two years of life significantly impacts subsequent composition and diversity, 
influencing immune system development and long-term health. Early-life exposure 
to pathogens is crucial for establishing immunological memory and acquired 
immunity. Factors such as maternal health habits, delivery mode, and 
breastfeeding duration contribute to gut dysbiosis. Despite fungi's critical 
role in health, particularly for vulnerable newborns, research on the gut 
mycobiome in infants and children remains limited. Understanding early-life 
factors shaping the gut mycobiome and its interactions with other microbial 
communities is a significant research challenge. This review explores potential 
factors influencing the gut mycobiome, microbial kingdom interactions, and their 
connections to health outcomes from childhood to adulthood. We identify gaps in 
current knowledge and propose future research directions in this complex field.

Mal secco is a vascular disease of citrus caused by the mitosporic fungus 
Plenodomus tracheiphilus. Soil containing infected plant material constitutes an 
inoculum source for root infections. In this study, the soil bacterial and 
fungal communities of five lemon orchards located in Syracuse Province (Sicily, 
Italy) affected by mal secco were analyzed. Soil samples were collected under 
lemon tree canopies and subjected to total genomic DNA extraction. The fungal 
DNA was detected through qPCR in all orchards, with variable concentrations. 
Bacterial and fungal communities were profiled using 16S and ITS amplicon-based 
high-throughput sequencing, respectively. According to our results, the relative 
abundances of the most represented bacterial phyla (e.g., Proteobacteria, 
Actinobacteriota, Acidobacteriota) changed across the orchards, while in the 
fungal community, the phylum Ascomycota was dominant, with Basidiomycota and 
Mortierellomycota abundances fluctuating. On the whole, β diversity analysis 
showed significant variation in the composition of the soil microbial 
communities across the orchards. This result was confirmed by the analysis of 
the core community (taxa present at ≥ 75% of total samples), where putative 
beneficial bacteria resulted in significantly enriched fungus-infected soil 
samples, suggesting complex microbial interactions. Our findings shed light on 
the composition and diversity of the soil microbiome in lemon orchards with the 
occurrence of mal secco infections.

INTRODUCTION: Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is a severe phenotype of 
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), characterised by localised 
and exaggerated type 2 inflammation. While fungal antigenic stimulation of 
unregulated Th2-mediated inflammation is the core pathophysiological mechanism, 
the direct and synergistic role of bacteria in disease modification is a 
pervasive hypothesis. We set out to define the microenvironment of AFRS to 
elucidate virulent organisms that may be implicated in the pathophysiology of 
AFRS.
METHODOLOGY: We undertook a cross-sectional study of AFRS patients and 
non-fungal CRSwNP patients. Demographics, disease severity, culture and 
microbiome sequences were analysed. Multimodality microbiome sequencing included 
short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina Miseq (16S rRNA and 
ITS) and full-length 16S rRNA sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies 
GridION (ONT).
RESULTS: Thirty-two AFRS and 29 non-fungal CRSwNP patients (NF) were included in 
this study. Staphylococcus aureus was the dominant organism cultured and 
sequenced in both AFRS and NF groups (AFRS 27.54%; NF 18.04%; p = .07). 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (AFRS 12.31%; NF 0.98%; p = .03) and Haemophilus 
influenzae (AFRS 15.03%; NF 0.24%; p = .005) were significantly more abundant in 
AFRS. Bacterial diversity (Shannon's index) was considerably lower in AFRS 
relative to NF (AFRS 0.6; NF 1.0, p = .008). Aspergillus was the most cultured 
fungus in AFRS (10/32, 31.3%). The AFRS sequenced mycobiome was predominantly 
represented by Malassezia (43.6%), Curvularia (18.5%) and Aspergillus (16.8%), 
while the NF mycobiome was nearly exclusively Malassezia (84.2%) with an absence 
of Aspergillus or dematiaceous fungi.
CONCLUSION: A low diversity, dysbiotic microenvironment dominated by 
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae 
characterised the bacterial microbiome of AFRS, with a mycobiome abundant in 
Malassezia, Aspergillus and Curvularia. While Staphylococcus aureus has been 
previously implicated in AFRS through enterotoxin superantigen potential, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are novel findings that may 
represent alternate cross-kingdom pathophysiological mechanisms.

Head and neck dermatitis (HND) is a form of atopic dermatitis (AD) that affects 
the seborrheic areas of the body and causes greater quality of life detriments 
than other types of AD. HND can be challenging to treat since first-line topical 
therapies may be ineffective or intolerable for long-term use on areas affected 
by HND while dupilumab may cause dupilumab-associated HND (DAHND). Current 
evidence implicates fungi, particularly Malassezia spp., in the pathogenesis of 
HND. Penetration of fungal antigens through the defective AD skin barrier 
activates the innate and adaptive immune systems to cause cutaneous inflammation 
via the T helper (Th)17 and/or Th2 axes. Malassezia sensitization may 
distinguish HND from other forms of AD. Multiple double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trials have shown antifungals to benefit HND, yet the 
persistence of symptom relief with sustained use remains unclear. Oral 
antifungals appear more effective than topical antifungals but may be harmful 
with long-term use. DAHND may also be fungal-mediated given improvement with 
antifungals and evidence of an overactive immune response against Malassezia in 
these patients. Janus kinase inhibitors are effective for HND, including DAHND, 
but may cause significant side effects when administered systemically. 
OX40/OX40L inhibitors and tralokinumab may be promising options for HND on the 
horizon. Demographic and environmental factors influence the host mycobiome and 
should be considered in future precision-medicine approaches as microbiome 
composition and diversity are linked to severity of HND.

Companion animals such as cats and dogs harbor diverse microbial communities 
that can potentially impact human health due to close and frequent contact. To 
better characterize their total infectomes and assess zoonotic risks, we 
characterized the overall infectomes of companion animals (cats and dogs) and 
evaluated their potential zoonotic risks. Meta-transcriptomic analyses were 
performed on 239 samples from cats and dogs collected across China, identifying 
24 viral species, 270 bacterial genera, and two fungal genera. Differences in 
the overall microbiome and infectome composition were compared across different 
animal species (cats or dogs), sampling sites (rectal or oropharyngeal), and 
health status (healthy or diseased). Diversity analyses revealed that viral 
abundance was generally higher in diseased animals compared to healthy ones, 
while differences in microbial composition were mainly driven by sampling site, 
followed by animal species and health status. Disease association analyses 
validated the pathogenicity of known pathogens and suggested potential 
pathogenic roles of previously undescribed bacteria and newly discovered 
viruses. Cross-species transmission analyses identified seven pathogens shared 
between cats and dogs, such as alphacoronavirus 1, which was detected in both 
oropharyngeal and rectal swabs albeit with differential pathogenicity. Further 
analyses showed that some viruses, like alphacoronavirus 1, harbored multiple 
lineages exhibiting distinct pathogenicity, tissue, or host preferences. 
Ultimately, a systematic evolutionary screening identified 27 potential zoonotic 
pathogens in this sample set, with far more bacterial than viral species, 
implying potential health threats to humans. Overall, our meta-transcriptomic 
analysis reveals a landscape of actively transcribing microorganisms in major 
companion animals, highlighting key pathogens, those with the potential for 
cross-species transmission, and possible zoonotic threats.
IMPORTANCE: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of the entire 
community of infectious microbes (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) in companion 
animals like cats and dogs, termed the "infectome." By analyzing hundreds of 
samples from across China, the researchers identified numerous known and novel 
pathogens, including 27 potential zoonotic agents that could pose health risks 
to both animals and humans. Notably, some of these zoonotic pathogens were 
detected even in apparently healthy pets, highlighting the importance of 
surveillance. The study also revealed key microbial factors associated with 
respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in pets, as well as potential 
cross-species transmission events between cats and dogs. Overall, this work 
sheds light on the complex microbial landscapes of companion animals and their 
potential impacts on animal and human health, underscoring the need for 
monitoring and management of these infectious agents.

INTRODUCTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent vaginal infection 
affecting women of childbearing age worldwide. It is associated with significant 
adverse healthcare outcomes, especially during pregnancy. Although screening for 
BV could reduce potential pregnancy-related obstetric complications, there is no 
routine screening of pregnant women for BV in Vietnam. We aimed to identify the 
prevalence of BV among pregnant women and the associated factors in two tertiary 
hospitals in Hue, Vietnam.
METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 885 pregnant women 
in third trimester, who received routine antenatal care in the Hue Central 
Hospital and Hue University Hospital of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hue city, Thua 
Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Gram-stained vaginal smears were used for 
calculating the Nugent score and recording the fungal elements.
RESULTS: In total, 435 (49.1%) women had a normal BV score, 352 (39.8%) had 
intermediate vaginal microbiota, and 98 (11.1%) had BV. Among the 98 women with 
BV, 71 (72.4%) also had fungal infection. There was a significant association of 
BV with discharge (p = 0.004) and abnormal cervix (p = 0.014). BV was 
significantly more frequent among the women who reported previous abortion or 
miscarriage (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: About a tenth of women in Thua Thien Hue province have BV in the 
third trimester of pregnancy being associated with previous adverse outcome. 
Discharge with fishy odour is still a characteristic feature among subtle 
clinical presentations of BV. Better awareness about this disease and routine 
test-and-treat management during pregnancy may improve pregnancy outcome.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to demonstrate the correlation between altered balance 
of the vaginal ecosystem and increased risk of vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, 
and sexually transmitted diseases and the association between specific 
alterations found in fresh bacterioscopic examinations (FBE) and the risk of 
certain infections.
METHODS: A retrospective, monocentric study was conducted from January 2013 to 
December 2023. Patients who underwent FBE and vaginal swabs following reported 
symptoms or suspected syndromic pictures of vulvovaginal infections were 
included.
RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred ten patients were included and divided into a 
control group (n = 811, 38.4%) and a pathological group (n = 1299 patients, 
61.6%), based on the presence of alterations at the FBE. In the pathological 
group, 1185 women (91% of positive FBE) had vaginal infections detected through 
vaginal swabs. The presence of lactobacilli and typical inflammatory cells was 
detected in 111 (8%) women with pathological FBE and correlated with higher 
rates of positive swabs for common germs (n = 104, 94%), often leading to 
co-infections (n = 30, 29%). Conversely, Döderlein's cytolysis (n = 56, 4.3% of 
positive FBE) indicated a predominance of positive human papillomavirus (HPV) 
swabs (n = 33, 59%). The presence of fungal elements (n = 208, 16% of positive 
FBE) suggested a higher prevalence of co-infections (n = 62, 30%). Similarly, 
mixed bacterial flora (n = 470, 36% of positive FBE) and Trichomonas vaginalis 
(n = 11, 0.8% of positive FBE) correlated with positive swabs for other 
pathogens, except for Mycoplasma (n = 0). Bacterial vaginosis (n = 443, 34% of 
positive FBE) was linked to co-infections (n = 142, 32%) and HPV (n = 123, 28%).
CONCLUSION: The importance of conducting FBE in patients with vulvovaginal 
symptoms is emphasized. This approach aids in determining the need for further 
diagnostic tests like vaginal swabs, guided by microscopic findings. A strong 
correlation emerges between the presence of specific alterations in the FBE and 
an increased prevalence of certain infections.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, 
modulate immune cell functions, particularly macrophages. This review explores 
the potential therapeutic applications of SCFAs in pulmonary fungal infections, 
a critical concern due to their high mortality rates and antifungal resistance. 
SCFAs enhance macrophage functions by promoting phagosome-lysosome fusion, 
increasing reactive oxygen species production, and balancing cytokine responses. 
Pulmonary fungal infections, caused by pathogens like Aspergillus fumigatus, are 
prevalent in immunocompromised patients, including those with diabetes, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and those on high-dose corticosteroids. SCFAs 
have shown promise in improving macrophage function in these contexts. However, 
the application of SCFAs must be balanced against potential side effects, 
including gut microbiota disruption and metabolic disorders. Further research is 
needed to optimize SCFA therapy for managing pulmonary fungal infections.

Entomopathogenic fungi may interact with insects' symbiotic bacteria during 
infection. We hypothesized that topical infection with Beauveria bassiana may 
alter the microbiota of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) and that these 
modifications may alter the course of mycoses. We used a model with two 
concentrations of conidia: (1) high concentration that causes rapid (acute) 
pathogenesis with fast mortality followed by bacterial decomposition of insects; 
(2) lower concentration that leads to prolonged pathogenesis ending in 
conidiation on cadavers. The fungal infections increased loads of enterobacteria 
and bacilli on the cuticle surface and in hemolymph and midgut, and the greatest 
increase was detected during the acute mycosis. By contrast, stronger activation 
of IMD and JAK-STAT signaling pathways in integuments and fat body was observed 
during the prolonged mycosis. Relatively stable (nonpathogenic) conditions 
remained in the midgut during both scenarios of mycosis with slight changes in 
bacterial communities, the absence of mesh and stat expression, a decrease in 
reactive oxygen species production, and slight induction of Toll and IMD 
pathways. Oral administration of antibiotic and predominant CPB bacteria 
(Enterobacteriaceae, Lactococcus, Pseudomonas) led to minor and mainly 
antagonistic effects in survival of larvae infected with B. bassiana. We believe 
that prolonged mycosis is necessary for successful development of the fungus 
because such pathogenesis allows the host to activate antibacterial reactions. 
Conversely, after infection with high concentrations of the fungus, the host's 
resources are insufficient to fully activate antibacterial defenses, and this 
situation makes successful development of the fungus impossible.

The human microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem populated by bacteria, 
fungi, viruses, protists, and archaea. The coexistence of fungi alongside with 
many billions of bacteria, especially in the gut, involves complex interactions, 
ranging from antagonistic to beneficial, between the members of these two 
kingdoms. Bacteria can impact fungi through various means, such as physical 
interactions, secretion of metabolites, or alteration of the host immune 
response, thereby affecting fungal growth and virulence. This review summarizes 
recent progress in this field, delving into the latest understandings of 
bacterial-fungal-immune interactions and innovative therapeutic approaches 
addressing the challenges of treating fungal infections associated with 
microbiota imbalances.

The upper respiratory tract (URT) is home to a diverse range of microbial 
species. Respiratory infections disturb the microbial flora in the URT, putting 
people at risk of secondary infections. The potential dangers and clinical 
effects of bacterial and fungal coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 support the need to 
investigate the microbiome of the URT using clinical samples. Mass spectrometry 
(MS)-based metaproteomics analysis of microbial proteins is a novel approach to

coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is 
responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a plethora of microbial

Fungal infections of fresh fruits and vegetables (FFVs) can lead to safety 
problems, including consumer poisoning by mycotoxins. Various strategies exist 
to control fungal infections of FFVs, but their effectiveness and sustainability 
are limited. Recently, new concepts based on the microbiome and pathobiome have 
emerged and offer a more holistic perspective for advancing postharvest pathogen 
control techniques. Understanding the role of the microbiome in FFV infections 
is essential for developing sustainable control strategies. This review examines 
current and emerging approaches to postharvest pathology. It reviews what is 
known about the initiation and development of infections in FFVs. As a promising 
concept, the pathobiome offers new insights into the basic mechanisms of 
microbial infections in FFVs. The underlying mechanisms uncovered by the 
pathobiome are being used to develop more relevant global antifungal strategies. 
This review will also focus on new technologies developed to target the 
microbiome and members of the pathobiome to control infections in FFVs and 
improve safety by limiting mycotoxin contamination. Specifically, this review 
stresses emerging technologies related to FFVs that are relevant for modifying 
the interaction between FFVs and the microbiome and include the use of microbial 
consortia, the use of genomic technology to manipulate host and microbial 
community genes, and the use of databases, deep learning, and artificial 
intelligence to identify pathobiome markers. Other approaches include 
programming the behavior of FFVs using synthetic biology, modifying the 
microbiome using sRNA technology, phages, quorum sensing, and quorum quenching 
strategies. Rapid adoption and commercialization of these technologies are 
recommended to further improve the overall safety of FFVs.

Vaginal colonization by fungi may elicit genital inflammation and enhance the 
risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes, such as HIV acquisition. 
Cross-sectional studies have linked fungi with an absence of bacterial vaginosis 
(BV), but it is unclear whether shifts in vaginal bacteria alter the abundance 
of vaginal fungi. Vaginal swabs collected following topical metronidazole 
treatment for BV during the phase 2b, placebo-controlled trial of LACTIN-V, a 
Lactobacillus crispatus-based live biotherapeutic, were assayed with 
semi-quantitative PCR for the relative quantitation of fungi and key bacterial 
species and multiplex immunoassay for immune factors. Vaginal fungi increased 
immediately following metronidazole treatment for BV (adjusted P = 0.0006), with 
most of this increase attributable to Candida albicans. Vaginal fungi were 
independently linked to elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine 
interleukin (IL) 17A, although this association did not remain significant after 
correcting for multiple comparisons. Fungal relative abundance by 
semi-quantitative PCR returned to baseline levels within 1 month of 
metronidazole treatment and was not affected by LACTIN-V or placebo 
administration. Fungal abundance was positively associated with Lactobacillus 
species, negatively associated with BV-associated bacteria, and positively 
associated with a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including 
IL-17A, during and after study product administration. Antibiotic treatment for 
BV resulted in a transient expanded abundance of vaginal fungi in a subset of 
women which was unaffected by subsequent administration of LACTIN-V. Vaginal 
fungi were positively associated with Lactobacillus species and IL-17A and 
negatively associated with BV-associated bacteria; these associations were most 
pronounced in the longer-term outcomes.IMPORTANCEVaginal colonization by fungi 
can enhance the risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes and HIV 
acquisition, potentially by eliciting genital mucosal inflammation. We show that 
standard antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV) results in a 
transient increase in the absolute abundance of vaginal fungi, most of which was 
identified as Candida albicans. Vaginal fungi were positively associated with 
proinflammatory immune factors and negatively associated with BV-associated 
bacteria. These findings improve our understanding of how shifts in the 
bacterial composition of the vaginal microbiota may enhance proliferation by 
proinflammatory vaginal fungi, which may have important implications for risk of 
adverse reproductive health outcomes among women.

The existence of microbiome in human tumors has been determined widely, but 
evaluating the contribution of intratumoral bacteria and fungi to tumor immunity 
and prognosis from a pan-cancer perspective remains absent. We designed an 
improved microbial analysis pipeline to reduce interference from host sequences, 
complemented with integration analysis of intratumoral microbiota at species 
level with clinical indicators, tumor microenvironment, and prognosis across 
cancer types. We found that intratumoral microbiota is associated with 
immunophenotyping, with high-immunity subtypes showing greater bacterial and 
fungal richness compared to low-immunity groups. We also noted that the 
combination of fungi and bacteria demonstrated promising prognostic value across 
cancer types. We, thus, present The Cancer Microbiota (TCMbio), an interactive 
platform that provides the intratumoral bacteria and fungi data, and a 
comprehensive analysis module for 33 types of cancers. This led to the discovery 
of clinical and prognostic significance of intratumoral microbes.

The human vagina harbours diverse microorganisms-bacteria, viruses and 
fungi-with profound implications for women's health. Genome-level analysis of 
the vaginal microbiome across multiple kingdoms remains limited. Here we utilize 
metagenomic sequencing data and fungal cultivation to establish the Vaginal 
Microbial Genome Collection (VMGC), comprising 33,804 microbial genomes spanning 
786 prokaryotic species, 11 fungal species and 4,263 viral operational taxonomic 
units. Notably, over 25% of prokaryotic species and 85% of viral operational 
taxonomic units remain uncultured. This collection significantly enriches 
genomic diversity, especially for prevalent vaginal pathogens such as BVAB1 (an 
uncultured bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium) and Amygdalobacter spp. 
(BVAB2 and related species). Leveraging VMGC, we characterize functional traits 
of prokaryotes, notably Saccharofermentanales (an underexplored yet prevalent 
order), along with prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, offering insights into 
their niche adaptation and potential roles in the vagina. VMGC serves as a 
valuable resource for studying vaginal microbiota and its impact on vaginal 
health.

Candida albicans is a commensal of the human microbiota that can form biofilms 
on implanted medical devices. These biofilms are tolerant to antifungals and to 
the host immune system. To identify novel genes modulating C. albicans biofilm 
formation, we performed a large-scale screen with 2,454 C. albicans 
doxycycline-dependent overexpression strains and identified 16 genes whose 
overexpression significantly hampered biofilm formation. Among those, 
overexpression of the ZCF15 and ZCF26 paralogs that encode transcription factors 
and have orthologs only in biofilm-forming species of the Candida clade, caused 
impaired biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, 
overexpression of ZCF15 impeded biofilm formation without any defect in hyphal 
growth. Transcript profiling, transcription factor binding, and phenotypic 
microarray analyses conducted upon overexpression of ZCF15 and ZCF26 
demonstrated their role in reprogramming cellular metabolism by regulating 
central metabolism including glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes. 
Taken together, this study has identified a new set of biofilm regulators, 
including ZCF15 and ZCF26, that appear to control biofilm development through 
their specific role in metabolic remodeling.

Microbes and enzymes play essential roles in soil and plant rhizosphere 
ecosystem functioning. However, fungicides and plant root secretions may impact 
the diversity and abundance of microbiota structure and enzymatic activities in 
the plant rhizosphere. In this study, we analyzed soil samples from the 
rhizosphere of four cannabinoid-rich hemp (Cannabis sativa) cultivars (Otto II, 
BaOx, Cherry Citrus, and Wife) subjected to three different treatments (natural 
infection, fungal inoculation, and fungicide treatment). DNA was extracted from 
the soil samples, 16S rDNA was sequenced, and data were analyzed for diversity 
and abundance among different fungicide treatments and hemp cultivars. Fungicide 
treatment significantly impacted the diversity and abundance of the hemp 
rhizosphere microbiota structure, and it substantially increased the abundance 
of the phyla Archaea and Rokubacteria. However, the abundances of the phyla 
Pseudomonadota and Gemmatimonadetes were substantially decreased in treatments 
with fungicides compared to those without fungicides in the four hemp cultivars. 
In addition, the diversity and abundance of the rhizosphere microbiota structure 
were influenced by hemp cultivars. The influence of Cherry Citrus on the 
diversity and abundance of the hemp rhizosphere microbiota structure was less 
compared to the other three hemp cultivars (Otto II, BaOx, and Wife). Moreover, 
fungicide treatment affected enzymatic activities in the hemp rhizosphere. The 
application of fungicides significantly decreased enzyme abundance in the 
rhizosphere of all four hemp cultivars. Enzymes such as dehydrogenase, 
dioxygenase, hydrolase, transferase, oxidase, carboxylase, and peptidase 
significantly decreased in all the four hemp rhizosphere treated with fungicides 
compared to those not treated. These enzymes may be involved in the function of 
metabolizing organic matter and degrading xenobiotics. The ecological 
significance of these findings lies in the recognition that fungicides impact 
enzymes, microbiota structure, and the overall ecosystem within the hemp 
rhizosphere.
