Leukemia poses significant challenges to its treatment, and understanding its 
complex pathogenesis is crucial. This study used metagenomic sequencing to 
investigate the interplay between chemotherapy, gut microbiota, and antibiotic 
resistance in patients with acute leukemia (AL). Pre- and post-chemotherapy 
stool samples from patients revealed alterations in microbial richness, taxa, 
and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The analysis revealed a decreased alpha 
diversity, increased dispersion in post-chemotherapy samples, and changes in the 
abundance of specific bacteria. Key bacteria such as Enterococcus, Klebsiella, 
and Escherichia coli have been identified as prevalent ARG carriers. Correlation 
analysis between gut microbiota and blood indicators revealed potential links 
between microbial species and inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and adenosine deaminase (ADA). This study investigated the impact 
of antibiotic dosage on microbiota and ARGs, revealing networks connecting 
co-occurring ARGs with microbial species (179 nodes, 206 edges), and networks 
associated with ARGs and antibiotic dosages (50 nodes, 50 edges). Antibiotics 
such as cephamycin and sulfonamide led to multidrug-resistant Klebsiella 
colonization. Our analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles with Salmonella 
enterica elevated post-chemotherapy in NF patients and Akkermansia muciniphila 
elevated pre-chemotherapy. These microbial signatures could inform strategies to 
modulate the gut microbiome, potentially mitigating the risk of neutropenic 
fever in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of 
KEGG modules shed light on disrupted metabolic pathways after chemotherapy, 
providing insights into potential targets for managing side effects. Overall, 
this study revealed intricate relationships between gut microbiota, 
chemotherapy, and antibiotic resistance, providing new insights into improving 
therapy and enhancing patient outcomes.

The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we 
perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, 
and healthy controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene 
functions, and antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External 
metagenomic datasets from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were 
analyzed to validate our multi-biome findings. We found that Enterococcus 
faecium and Bifidobacterium spp. were enriched in both diseases. Enriched 
Escherichia coli was characteristic of CD and was linked to numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes involved in efflux pumps and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli 
virulence factors. Virome changes correlated with shifts in the bacteriome, 
including increased abundances of phages encoding pathogenic genes. 
Saccharomyces paradoxus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in UC and CD, 
respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli had negative 
associations with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in CD. 
Multi-biome signatures and their interactions in UC and CD showed high 
similarities between Japan and other countries. Since bacteria, phages, and 
fungi formed multiple hubs of intra- or trans-kingdom networks with SCFA 
producers and pathobionts in UC and CD, an approach targeting the interaction 
network may hold therapeutic promise.

Pelagic transport causes oil pollution via international tanker routes in the 
open ocean across southern Asia and the Indian Territory. Nutrient-rich runoff 
from residential, commercial, and industrial wastes, oil tanker mishaps, and 
sailing flags have all resulted in pollution. The natural flow of ocean water 
from east to west dragged pollutants into Indian Territory. We have investigated 
that the severe deposition of oil spills and biohazardous wastes is causing 
faunal mortality. Microbiome analyses helped us understand the sample's 
microbial load. 16S amplicon metagenome analysis, followed by enumeration and 
confirmation using molecular methods, indicates the presence of diverse 
microbial profiles. The presence of non-native hydrocarbon- and AMR-resistant 
bacterial taxa, such as Brevundimonas, Staphylococcus spp., Mycolicibacterium, 
Spingomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Chitinophaga spp., Priestia spp., Domibacillus 
spp., Rossellomorea spp., and Acinetobacter spp., confirms the impacts of oil 
and urban pollution. This indicates that the coastal soil of Goa and Andhra 
Pradesh has hydrocarbon- and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which confirms that 
the present pollution status and that high-traffic recreational activities put 
biodiversity and humans at risk of getting illnesses linked to antibiotic 
resistance.

Targeting specific gut microbiota (GM) species to prevent and treat acute upper 
respiratory tract infection (AURTI) has attracted researchers' attention, but 
the relationship between the two is unclear. Based on the summary data from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on GM and five types of AURTIs (acute 
nasopharyngitis (common cold), acute pharyngitis, acute sinusitis, acute upper 
respiratory infections, and acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and 
unspecified sites), we performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship. Through inverse variance 
weighting (IVW) method, we found that 33 potential microbial taxa can influence 
the occurrence of AURTI. Sensitivity analysis showed no potential horizontal 
pleiotropy and heterogeneity bias. We further employed multivariable Mendelian 
randomization to investigate the impact of potential interference factors on the 
significant associations previously identified, considering aspects such as 
comorbidities associated with AURTI, seasonal variations, pathogen specificity, 
and history of antibiotic allergies. Ultimately, 11 microbial taxa remained 
significantly associated. This study provides robust evidence for a causal 
relationship between GM and five types of AURTIs, thereby offering a foundation 
for the development of microbiota-targeted therapies and related probiotic 
interventions aimed at AURTI.

BACKGROUND: The extensive use of antibiotics in the global livestock industry in 
recent decades has accelerated the accumulation and dissemination of 
antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) within terrestrial ecosystems. This occurs 
due to the limited absorption of most antibiotics, leading to their release into 
the environment through feces and urine. This poses a significant threat to both 
the environment and human health. However, the response of antibiotic-resistant 
microorganisms and their ARGs in grasslands to prolonged grazing, as well as the 
primary microbial taxa driving the ARG distribution, remain poorly understood, 
especially within various microhabitats. In this study, we characterized ARGs in 
the phyllosphere, litter, and soil after decades of livestock grazing in a 
meadow steppe. We particularly focused on identifying the major members of the 
microbial community influencing ARGs and the distinction between microbial 
generalists and specialists.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that a core set of ARGs accounted for 90% of the 
abundance in this plant-soil ecosystem. While the soil exhibited the highest ARG 
abundance, the phyllosphere, and litter displayed higher ARG diversity and 
diverse distribution patterns after overgrazing. Grazing increased ARG abundance 
by elevating the proportion of core ARGs and suppressing stochastic ARGs in the 
phyllosphere and litter, while it had little effect on the ARGs in the soil. 
Additionally, microbial generalist abundance increased, but specialist abundance 
decreased in the phyllosphere and litter, with no effect in the soil, under 
grazed conditions. Ultimately, microbial microhabitats and grazing influenced 
ARG community characteristics through direct (i.e., feces and other exogenous 
ARG input) and indirect (i.e., trampling and selective feeding) effects on 
nutrient availability, microbial community composition, and mobile genetic 
elements. The generalist community, with its broad ecological niches and 
phylogenetic composition, made the most significant contribution to the ARG 
characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the impact of environmental disturbances on 
the distributional patterns of ARGs in ecosystems, mediated by the regulation of 
microbial generalized species. These insights enhance our understanding of 
microbial control over ARGs and facilitate predictions regarding the dynamics 
and risk of ARGs in diverse ecological niches subjected to anthropogenic 
disturbances. Video Abstract.

The high-latitude regions of Antarctica remain among the most remote, extreme, 
and least explored areas on Earth. Still, microbial life has been reported in 
these environments, with limited information on their genetic properties and 
functional capabilities. Although diverse autochthonous multidrug-resistant 
bacteria were found in Antarctic Peninsula soils, posing whether these soils 
could act as a source of resistance determinants that could emerge among 
pathogens, we still lack information regarding the resistome of areas closer to 
the South Pole. Moreover, no previous studies have evaluated the pathogenic 
potential of microbes inhabiting Antarctic soils. In this work, we combined 
metagenomic and culture-dependent approaches to investigate the microbial 
diversity, resistome, virulome, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in soils from 
Union Glacier, a cold desert in West Antarctica. Despite the extreme conditions, 
several bacterial phyla were found, predominating Actinomycetota and 
Pseudomonadota, with limited archaeal and fungal taxa. Contrastive with Ecology 
Glacier soils from King George Island, the Union Glacier soil bacterial 
community is significantly less diverse, mainly attributed to scarce moisture. 
We recovered >80 species-level representative genomes (SRGs) of predominant 
bacteria and an ammonia-oxidating nitrogen- and carbon-fixing archaeon from a 
novel species of Nitrosocosmicus. Several resistance and virulence genes were 
found in Union Glacier soils, similar to those in other Antarctic cold desert 
areas but significantly distinct from those observed in maritime Antarctica and 
other non-cryosphere biomes. Furthermore, we characterized bacterial isolates 
resistant to up to 24 clinical antibiotics, mainly Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, 
Plantibacter, and Flavobacterium. Moreover, some isolates produced putative 
virulence factors, including siderophores, pyocyanins, and exoenzymes with 
hemolytic, lecithinase, protease, and DNAse activity. This evidence uncovers a 
largely unexplored resistome and virulome hosted by deep Antarctica's soil 
microbial communities and the presence of bacteria with pathogenic potential, 
highlighting the relevance of One Health approaches for environmental 
surveillance in this continent.

Marine sponges are a prolific source of biologically active small molecules, 
many of which originate from sponge-associated bacteria. Identifying the 
producing bacteria is a key step in developing sustainable routes for the 
production of these metabolites. To facilitate the required computational 
analyses, we developed MetaSing, a reproducible singularity-based pipeline for 
assembly, identification of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), 
and analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from metagenomic short-read 
data. We applied this pipeline to metagenomic sequencing data from 16 marine 
sponges collected from New Zealand, Tonga, and the Mediterranean Sea. This 
analysis yielded 643 MAGs representing 510 species. Of the 2,670 BGCs identified 
across all samples, 70.8% were linked to a MAG. Comparison of BGCs to those 
identified from previously sequenced bacteria revealed high biosynthetic novelty 
in variety of underexplored phyla, including Poribacteria, Acidobacteriota, and 
Dadabacteria. Alongside the observation that each sample contains unique 
biosynthetic potential, this holds great promise for natural product discovery 
and for furthering the understanding of different sponge 
holobionts.IMPORTANCEDiscovery of new chemical compounds such as natural 
products is a crucial endeavor to combat the increasing resistance to 
antibiotics and other drugs. This manuscript demonstrates that microbial 
communities associated with marine sponges investigated in this work encode the 
potential to produce novel chemistry. Lesser studied bacterial taxa that are 
often difficult to cultivate are particularly rich in potential.

IMPORTANCE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is linked with alterations 
in the gut microbiome. The influence of adenotonsillectomy (AT), a primary 
intervention for OSA, on gut microbiota dynamics relative to disease severity 
remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of OSA severity and AT on 
the gut microbiome in pediatric patients.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 55 pediatric patients treated with AT for OSA.
INTERVENTION: Total tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive evaluations included in-laboratory 
polysomnography and 16S rRNA gut microbiome profiling at baseline, and again at 
3rd and 12thmonth following surgery.
RESULTS: Initial findings showed uniform α-diversity across different severities 
of OSA, while β-diversity was significantly elevated in the severe OSA subgroup. 
Certain gut microbiota taxa (Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Ruminococcaceae 
UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Alloprevotella, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, 
Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Lactobacillus murinus, and Prevotella nigrescens) were 
found to inversely correlate with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Significant 
post-AT improvements in AHI and other polysomnographic metrics were observed. 
Notably, AHI changes post-AT were positively associated with microbial 
α-diversity (species richness), β-diversity, and specific bacterial taxa 
(Enterobacter, Parasutterella, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Bacteroides plebeius 
DSM 17135), but negatively with other taxa (Fusicatenibacter, Bifidobacterium, 
UBA1819, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. Longum, and 
Parabacteroides distasonis) and specific metabolic pathways (purine metabolism, 
transcription factors, and type II diabetes mellitus). The postoperative 
patterns of α- and β-diversity mirrored baseline values.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study documents significant changes in the gut 
microbiome of pediatric patients after AT, including variations in α- and 
β-diversities, bacterial communities, and inferred metabolic functions. These 
changes suggest a potential association between the surgical intervention and 
microbiome alterations, although further studies are necessary to discern the 
specific contributions of AT amidst possible confounding factors such as 
antibiotic use.

resistance genes (ARGs), quantifying their relative contributions remains a 
fundamental challenge. Similarly, it is important to differentiate acute human 
health risks from environmental exposure, versus broader ecological risk of ARG 
evolution and spread across microbial taxa. Recent studies have proposed various 
methods for achieving such aims. Here, we introduce MetaCompare 2.0, which 
improves upon original MetaCompare pipeline by differentiating indicators of 
human health resistome risk (HHRR, potential for human pathogens of acute 
resistance concern to acquire ARGs) from ecological resistome risk (ERR, overall 
mobility of ARGs and potential for pathogen acquisition). The updated pipeline's 
sensitivity was demonstrated by analyzing diverse publicly-available metagenomes 
from wastewater, surface water, soil, sediment, human gut, and synthetic 
microbial communities. MetaCompare 2.0 provided distinct rankings of the 
metagenomes according to both HHRR and ERR, with both scores trending higher 
when influenced by anthropogenic impact or other stress. We evaluated the 
robustness of the pipeline to sequence assembly methods, sequencing depth, 
contig count, and metagenomic library coverage bias. The risk scores were 
remarkably consistent despite variations in these technological aspects. We 
packaged the improved pipeline into a publicly-available web service 
(http://metacompare.cs.vt.edu/) that provides an easy-to-use interface for 
computing resistome risk scores and visualizing results.

Menaquinone (MK) in bacterial membrane is an attractive target for the 
development of novel therapeutic agents. Mining the untapped chemical diversity 
encoded by Gram-negative bacteria presents an opportunity to identify additional 
MK-binding antibiotics (MBAs). By MK-binding motif searching of 
bioinformatically predicted linear non-ribosomal peptides from 14,298 sequenced 
genomes of 45 underexplored Gram-negative bacterial genera, here we identify a 
novel MBA structural family, including silvmeb and pseudomeb, using structure 
prediction-guided chemical synthesis. Both MBAs show rapid bacteriolysis by 
MK-dependent membrane depolarization to achieve their potent activities against 
a panel of Gram-positive pathogens. Furthermore, both MBAs are proven to be 
effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a murine 
peritonitis-sepsis model. Our findings suggest that MBAs are a kind of 
structurally diverse and still underexplored antibacterial lipodepsipeptide 
class. The interrogation of underexplored bacterial taxa using synthetic 
bioinformatic natural product methods is an appealing strategy for discovering 
novel biomedically relevant agents to confront the crisis of antimicrobial 
resistance.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are hotspots for pathogens, and can 
facilitate horizontal gene transfer, potentially releasing harmful genetic 
material and antimicrobial resistance genes into the environment. Little 
information exists on the composition and behavior of microbes in WWTPs, 
especially in developing countries. This study used environmental DNA (eDNA) 
techniques to examine the microbiome load of wastewater from WWTPs. The DNA was 
isolated from wastewater samples collected from the treatment trains of three 
WWTPs in Kimberley, South Africa, and the microbial diversity and composition 
was compared through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The microbes detected were of 
the Kingdom Bacteria, and of these, 48.27% were successfully identified to genus 
level. The majority of reads from the combined bacterial data fall within the 
class Gammaproteobacteria, which is known to adversely impact ecological and 
human health. Arcobacteraceae constituted 19% of the bacterial reads, which is 
expected as this family is widespread in aquatic environments. Interestingly, 
the most abundant bacterial group was Bacteroides, which contain a variety of 
antibiotic-resistant members. Overall, various antibiotic-resistant taxa were 
detected in the wastewater, indicating a concerning level of antibiotic 
resistance within the bacterial community. Therefore, eDNA analysis can be a 
valuable tool in monitoring and assessing the bacterial microbiome in 
wastewater, thus providing important information for the optimization and 
improvement of wastewater treatment systems and mitigate public health risks.

The growing demand for sustainable natural products to replace harmful synthetic 
ones requires comprehensive ecotoxicity assessments to ensure their eco-friendly 
nature. This study explored for the first time the changes in microbial 
community growth and metabolic profiles from river and natural soil samples 
exposed to the two structural isomers, thymol (THY) and carvacrol (CARV), 
utilizing Biolog EcoPlate™ assays and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for taxonomic 
analysis. In addition, we addressed existing ecotoxicity data gaps for these two 
compounds by using aquatic (Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri) and soil (Eisenia 
fetida and Allium cepa) indicators. Results show acute toxicity of both CARV and 
THY on all indicators. V. fischeri (LC50 = 0.59 mg/L) > D. magna 
(4.75 mg/L) > A. cepa (6.47 mg/L) for CARV, and V. fischeri 
(LC50 = 1.71 mg/L) > A. cepa (4.05 mg/L) > D. magna (8.13 mg/L) for THY. E. 
fetida showed LC50 = 7.68 mg/kg for THY and 1.04 for CARV. River and soil 
microbial communities showed resilience, likely because they contain taxa 
capable of biodegrading these products. No significant growth inhibition effects 
were observed up to 100 mg/L, though substrate utilization decreased at higher 
concentrations, particularly for polymers and amines in soil microorganisms and 
polymers in aquatic communities. Soil microorganisms were more affected than 
aquatic ones, with CARV being more toxic than THY (EC50120h = THY 94.13 and CARV 
29.79 mg/L in soil microorganisms). These findings suggest that an increase in 
the consumption of these products and their subsequent ecotoxicity effects from 
environmental discharge should still be monitored before being ruled out. 
However, long-term effects are unlikely due to microbial degradation of these 
natural products, potentially reducing risks to other target species and opening 
the way for their use as substitutes for commercial antibiotics.

Intermittently closed and opened lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) provide important 
ecosystem services, including food provision and nutrient cycling. These 
ecosystems generally experience low watershed outflow, resulting in substantial 
fluctuations in physicochemical parameters that are often compounded by 
anthropogenic contamination, however, how this impacts the patterns in 
microbiology within these environments remains uncharacterised. Therefore, we 
aimed to determine how seasonal heterogeneity in the physicochemical parameters, 
in comparison to faecal contamination, alter the dynamics of bacterial 
communities inhabiting ICOLLs on the eastern Australian coast. To address these 
aims, we sampled four ICOLLs on a monthly basis for one year, using 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon sequencing to monitor patterns in bacterial diversity and 
qPCR-based methods to measure faecal contamination from humans (sewage), dogs, 
and birds. Additionally, we used qPCR to monitor patterns of a suite of 
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including sulI, tetA, qnrS, dfrA1, and vanB. 
Differences in bacterial community composition were often associated with 
temporal shifts in salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved 
organic matter, but following periods of high rainfall, bacterial assemblages in 
two of four ICOLLs changed in direct response to sewage inputs. Within these 
ICOLLs, indicator taxa for stormwater identified using the 16S rRNA amplicon 
sequencing data, as well as markers for sewage and dog faeces, and levels of the 
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) sulI, tetA, and dfrA1 were significantly more 
abundant after rainfall. Notably many of the stormwater indicator taxa were 
potential human pathogens including Arcobacter and Aeromonas hydrophilia, which 
also displayed significant correlations, albeit weak to moderate, with levels of 
the ARGs sulI, tetA, and dfrA1. This broad-scale shift in the nature of the 
bacterial community following rainfall will likely lead to a substantial, and 
perhaps detrimental, divergence in the ecosystem services provided by the 
bacterial assemblages within these ICOLLs. We conclude that following rainfall 
events, sewage was a principal driver of shifts in the microbiology of ICOLLs 
exposed to stormwater, while natural seasonal shifts in the physicochemical 
parameters controlled bacterial communities at other times. Increased occurrence 
of intense precipitation events is predicted as a ramification of climate 
change, which will lead to increased impacts of stormwater and sewage 
contamination on important ICOLL ecosystems in the future.

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition marked by facial erythema, 
telangiectasia, and acne-like eruptions, affecting millions worldwide. While 
antibiotics remain a common treatment, prolonged use has significant adverse 
effects and can lead to antibiotic resistance. This study evaluated the impact 
of combined probiotics and doxycycline treatment on rosacea, emphasizing the 
gut-skin axis. Sixty rosacea patients were randomly assigned to the probiotic, 
placebo, or control groups. After a 2-week doxycycline treatment, participants 
underwent a 3-month intervention with either a placebo, probiotic, or no further 
treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the 14-week 
intervention. Our results showed that probiotic administration improved facial 
skin conditions, alleviated inflammation, and reduced facial skin microbiota 
diversity while enhancing gut microbiota heterogeneity. Multivariate analysis 
identified microbial markers distinguishing the probiotic group from the control 
and placebo groups, and some markers were associated with skin health 
parameters. After the probiotic intervention, some facial skin-associated taxa, 
such as Aquabacterium sp., UBA4096 sp. 1, UBA4096 sp. 2, and Yimella indica, 
decreased in abundance. Additionally, the fecal microbiota of the probiotic 
group was enriched in specific gut microbes, including Streptococcus 
parasanguinis, Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, and Coprobacillus cateniformis, 
while showing a reduced abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus. These changes were 
associated with reduced facial sebum levels and a lower physician's global 
assessment score. Finally, fewer antibiotic resistance genes, particularly 
tetracycline resistance genes, were detected in the probiotic group compared 
with the control and placebo groups. Our study supports the existence of a 
gut-skin axis and the application of probiotics in managing rosacea.
IMPORTANCE: This research elucidates rosacea management with novel insights into 
probiotic use alongside doxycycline, showing dual benefits in symptom relief and 
inflammation reduction in patients. The study maps probiotic-induced shifts in 
gut and skin microbiota, underscoring microbial shifts correlating with skin 
health improvements. Crucially, it deciphers the gut-skin axis modulation by 
probiotics, proposing a method to curb antibiotic resistance in rosacea 
therapies. This study furnishes robust evidence for probiotics in rosacea, 
advancing our grasp of the gut-skin relationship.

Plasmids, as independent genetic elements, carrying resistance or virulence 
genes and transfer them among different pathogens, posing a significant threat 
to human health. Under the 'One Health' approach, it is crucial to control the 
spread of plasmids carrying such genes. To achieve this, a comprehensive 
characterization of plasmids in pathogens is essential. Here we present the 
Plasmids in Pathogens Database (PIPdb), a pioneering resource that includes 
792 964 plasmid segment clusters (PSCs) derived from 1 009 571 assembled genomes 
across 450 pathogenic species from 110 genera. To our knowledge, PIPdb is the 
first database specifically dedicated to plasmids in pathogenic bacteria, 
offering detailed multi-dimensional metadata such as collection date, 
geographical origin, ecosystem, host taxonomy, and habitat. PIPdb also provides 
extensive functional annotations, including plasmid type, insertion sequences, 
integron, oriT, relaxase, T4CP, virulence factors genes, heavy metal resistance 
genes and antibiotic resistance genes. The database features a user-friendly 
interface that facilitates studies on plasmids across diverse host taxa, 
habitats, and ecosystems, with a focus on those carrying antimicrobial 
resistance genes (ARGs). We have integrated online tools for plasmid 
identification and annotation from assembled genomes. Additionally, PIPdb 
includes a risk-scoring system for identifying potentially high-risk plasmids. 
The PIPdb web interface is accessible at https://nmdc.cn/pipdb.

BACKGROUND: The maternal gut microbiome is the direct and important source of 
early colonization and development of the neonatal gut microbiome. However, 
differences in unique and shared features between mothers with different 
physiological phenotypes and their newborns still lack exhaustive investigation. 
Here, using a cow-to-calf model, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to 
elucidate the pattern and characterization of microbial transfer from the 
maternal source to the offspring.
RESULTS: The microbiota in the rumen and feces of dairy cows were divided into 
two clusters via enterotype analysis. The cows from the enterotype distinguished 
by Prevotella in the rumen had better production performance, whereas no 
difference was observed in the cows classified by feces enterotype. Furthermore, 
through a pairwise combination of fecal and ruminal enterotypes, we screened a 
group of dairy cows with excellent phenotypes. The gastrointestinal microbiomes 
of cows with different phenotypes and their offspring differed significantly. 
The rumen was a more important microbial source for meconium than feces. 
Transmission of beneficial bacteria from mother to offspring was observed. 
Additionally, the meconium inherits advantageous metabolic functions of the 
rumen. The resistome features of the rumen, feces, and meconium were consistent, 
and resistome abundance from cows to calves showed an expanding trend. The 
interaction between antibiotic-resistance genes and mobile genetic elements from 
the rumen to meconium was the most remarkable. The diversity of core metabolites 
from cows to calves was stable and not affected by differences in phenotypes. 
However, the abundance of specific metabolites varied greatly.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the microbial taxa, metabolic function, and 
resistome characteristics of maternal and neonatal microbiomes, and reveals the 
potential vertical transmission of the microbiome from a cow-to-calf model. 
These findings provide new insights into the transgenerational transmission 
pattern of the microbiome. Video Abstract.

Periodontitis disproportionately affects racial/ethnic populations. Besides 
social determinants contributing to disparities in periodontal health, 
variations of oral microbial communities may also be a key factor influencing 
oral immune responses. To characterize the oral microbiome from different 
racial/ethnic populations, we collected 161 dental plaque samples from African 
Americans (AAs), Caucasian Americans (CAs), and Hispanic Americans (HAs) with 
clinical gingival health or biofilm-induced gingivitis on an intact 
periodontium. Using metagenomic sequencing, we found significant difference in 
diversity and abundance of microbial taxa in the dental plaque samples from AA, 
CA, and HA groups and unique microbial species that can only be detected in a 
particular racial/ethnic group. Moreover, we revealed racial/ethnic associated 
variations in functional potential of the oral microbiome, showing that 
diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistant genes were greater in the oral 
microbiome of the AAs than those in CAs or HAs, and that the AAs exhibited 
higher levels of genes involving in modification of glycoconjugates, oligo- and 
polysaccharides. These findings indicate more complex and higher virulence 
potential oral microbiome in AA and HA populations, which likely contributes to 
higher prevalence of periodontitis in AAs and HAs.

Development of genome-editing tools in diverse microbial species is an important 
step both in understanding the roles of those microbes in different 
environments, and in engineering microbes for a variety of applications. 
Freshwater-specific clades of Actinobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant in 
surface freshwaters worldwide. Here, we show that Rhodoluna lacicola and 
Aurantimicrobium photophilum, which represent widespread clades of freshwater 
Actinobacteria, are naturally transformable. We also show that gene inactivation 
via double homologous recombination and replacement of the target gene with 
antibiotic selection markers can be used in both strains, making them convenient 
and broadly accessible model organisms for freshwater systems. We further show 
that in both strains, the predicted phytoene synthase is the only phytoene 
synthase, and its inactivation prevents the synthesis of all pigments. The tools 
developed here enable targeted modification of the genomes of some of the most 
abundant microbes in freshwater communities. These genome-editing tools will 
enable hypothesis testing about the genetics and (eco)physiology of freshwater 
Actinobacteria and broaden the available model systems for engineering 
freshwater microbial communities.
IMPORTANCE: To advance bioproduction or bioremediation in large, unsupervised 
environmental systems such as ponds, wastewater lagoons, or groundwater systems, 
it will be necessary to develop diverse genetically amenable microbial model 
organisms. Although we already genetically modify a few key species, tools for 
engineering more microbial taxa, with different natural phenotypes, will enable 
us to genetically engineer multispecies consortia or even complex communities. 
Developing genetic tools for modifying freshwater bacteria is particularly 
important, as wastewater, production ponds or raceways, and contaminated surface 
water are all freshwater systems where microbial communities are already 
deployed to do work, and the outputs could potentially be enhanced by genetic 
modifications. Here, we demonstrate that common tools for genome editing can be 
used to inactivate specific genes in two representatives of a very widespread, 
environmentally relevant group of Actinobacteria. These Actinobacteria are found 
in almost all tested surface freshwater environments, where they co-occur with 
primary producers, and genome-editing tools in these species are thus a step on 
the way to engineering microbial consortia in freshwater environments.

Background: Peanut consumption could impact cardiometabolic health through gut 
microbiota, a hypothesis that remains to be investigated. A randomized clinical 
trial in Vietnam evaluated whether peanut consumption alters gut microbiome 
communities. Methods: One hundred individuals were included and randomly 
assigned to the peanut intervention and control groups. A total of 51 
participants were provided with and asked to consume 50 g of peanuts daily, 
while 49 controls maintained their usual dietary intake for 16 weeks. Stool 
samples were collected before and on the last day of the trial. After excluding 
22 non-compliant participants and those who received antibiotic treatment, 35 
participants from the intervention and 43 from the control were included in the 
analysis. Gut microbiota composition was measured by shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing. Associations of changes in gut microbial diversity with peanut 
intervention were evaluated via linear regression analysis. Linear mixed-effects 
models were used to analyze associations of composition, sub-community 
structure, and microbial metabolic pathways with peanut intervention. We also 
performed beta regression analysis to examine the impact of peanut intervention 
on the overall and individual stability of microbial taxa and metabolic 
pathways. All associations with false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values of 
<0.1 were considered statistically significant. Results: No significant changes 
were found in α- and β-diversities and overall gut microbial stability after 
peanut intervention. However, the peanut intervention led to lower enrichment of 
five phyla, five classes, two orders, twenty-four metabolic pathways, and six 
species-level sub-communities, with a dominant representation of Bifidobacterium 
pseudocatenulatum, Escherichia coli D, Holdemanella biformis, Ruminococcus D 
bicirculans, Roseburia inulinivorans, and MGYG-HGUT-00200 (p < 0.05 and FDR < 
0.1). The peanut intervention led to the short-term stability of several 
species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii F and H, and a metabolic pathway 
involved in nitrate reduction V (p < 0.05; FDR < 0.1), known for their potential 
roles in human health, especially cardiovascular health. Conclusions: In 
summary, a 16-week peanut intervention led to significant changes in gut 
microbial composition, species-level sub-communities, and the short-term 
stability of several bacteria, but not overall gut microbial diversity and 
stability. Further research with a larger sample size and a longer intervention 
period is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the direct impact of 
gut-microbiome-mediated health effects of peanut consumption. Trial

The concept and application of probiotic intervention for restoring intestinal 
microbial dysbiosis induced by antibiotics in aquaculture are still in early 
stages. This study aimed to investigate potential responses of various recovery 
strategies, including natural recovery and probiotic intervention, in restoring 
the growth and intestinal microbial community of Penaeus vannamei following 
florfenicol perturbation. The basal diet (control, CN) was supplemented with 
florfenicol (FC) or Lactobacillus plantarum W2 (LM) throughout the entire 
feeding trial. Meanwhile, the basal diet was supplemented with florfenicol for 7 
days, followed by a period without florfenicol (natural recovery, FB), or with 
live strain W2 (probiotic recovery, FM), for a duration of 35 days. Results 
indicated that dietary supplementation of strain W2, whether continuous or 
following florfenicol perturbation, along with continuous florfenicol 
supplementation, significantly enhanced the growth performance of shrimp. Early 
natural recovery and probiotic intervention did not induce significant 
alterations in microbial diversity and community structure. Florfenicol 
perturbation resulted in a decrease in the abundance of potentially beneficial 
bacteria in intestinal microbial community of shrimp. However, both probiotic 
intervention and natural recovery strategies gradually reduced the abundance of 
potentially pathogenic bacteria while increasing the abundance of potentially 
beneficial ones. The robustness of microbial network decreased during 
florfenicol perturbation, showed gradual improvement during probiotic recovery, 
and remained relatively low during natural recovery and continuous florfenicol 
supplementation. Moreover, the microbial community composition in intestinal 
habitat significantly differed under various recovery strategies compared to the 
control. Notably, the microbial community composition of intestinal habitat 
following probiotic recovery exhibited greater similarity to that of continuous 
strain W2 supplementation without florfenicol perturbation. In summary, dietary 
supplementation of florfenicol perturbed intestinal microbial community 
stability of shrimp, whereas probiotic intervention and natural recovery 
facilitated the attainment of new stable states by altering keystone taxa. 
Considering intestinal microbial community stability of shrimp, the recovery of 
microbial community through probiotic intervention appears to be more effective 
than natural recovery.

The article presents a processed dataset from amplicon sequencing of the V4 
region of the 16S rRNA gene to recover bacterial and archaeal taxa from the 
caeca of multiple chicken breeds of Pakistan. These include chicken breeds 
commonly raised at commercial level, Naked Neck, Black Australorp, Rhode Island 
Red, White Layer, and Broiler. All the breeds were challenged with Newcastle 
Disease Virus (NDV), with vaccination against the disease also explored. This 
resulted in samples belonging to four treatment groups as: Control; Vaccinated; 
Vaccinated and Challenged; and Non-vaccinated and Challenged. These were raised 
on an antibiotic free diet in a semi-controlled farming setup. 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing of caecal DNA from day old and mature chicken samples (22 
weeks for Naked Neck, Black Australorp, Rhode Island Red and White Layer; 8 
weeks for Broiler) of the four groups was performed. The paired-end reads from 
all the samples were quality trimmed, error corrected, and overlapped, on which 
unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were obtained at 99 % similarity. 
Using predictive modelling, the MetaCyc functional pathways, as well as KEGG 
orthologs were also recovered. The generated data may be used to explore 
microbial interactions in gastrointestinal tract with respect to NDV vaccination 
and infection, together with increased understanding of chicken health and 
productivity.

The pervasive presence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic systems facilitates the 
transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), thereby posing risks to 
ecosystems and human well-being. However, owing to variations in environmental 
backgrounds and the limited scope of research subjects, studies on ARGs in MPs 
lack unified conclusions, particularly regarding whether different types of MPs 
selectively promote ARG enrichment. Analysing large-scale datasets can better 
encompass broad spatiotemporal scales and diverse samples, facilitating a more 
extensive exploration of the complex ecological relationships between MPs and 
ARGs. The present study integrated existing metagenomic datasets to conduct a 
comprehensive risk assessment and comparative analysis of resistance groups 
across various MPs. In addition, we endeavoured to elucidate potential 
associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa, as well as MP structural features, 
using machine learning (ML) methods. The findings of our research highlight the 
pivotal role of MP type in shaping plastispheres, accounting for 9.56 % of the 
biotic variation (Adonis index) and explaining 18.59 % of the ARG variance. 
Compared to conventional MPs, biodegradable MPs, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates 
(PHA) and polylactic acid (PLA), exhibit lower species uniformity and diversity 
but pose a higher risk of ARG occurrence. These ML approaches effectively 
forecasted ARG abundance by using the bacterial taxa and molecular structure 
descriptors (MDs) of MPs (average R2tra = 0.882, R2test = 0.759). Feature 
analysis showed that MDs associated with lipophilicity, solubility, toxicity, 
and surface potential significantly influenced the relative abundance of ARGs in 
the plastispheres. The interpretable multiple linear regression (MLR) model, 
particularly notable, elucidated a linear relationship between bacterial genera 
and ARGs, offering promise for identifying potential ARG hosts. This study 
offers novel insights into ARG dynamics and ecological risks within aquatic 
plastispheres, highlighting the importance of comprehensive MP monitoring 
initiatives.

INTRODUCTION: The impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota in kidney 
transplant recipients is not well characterized. In this study, we determine the 
impact of different subclasses of antibiotics on the gut microbiota in a cohort 
of 168 kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Gut microbiome profiling was performed on 510 fecal specimens using 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 hypervariable region. We classified fecal 
specimens by antibiotic exposure into 5 categories: Beta-lactam, Fluoroquinolone 
(FQ), Beta-lactam & FQ Group, Other Antibiotics, and No Antibiotic (No Abx). 
Mixed-effects regression models were utilized to identify changes in microbial 
diversity and in the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed abundance of genera 
while adjusting for important covariates.
RESULTS: Antibiotic administration was associated with a significant decrease in 
the Shannon alpha diversity index, a decreased abundance of 11 taxa including 
Eubacterium and Ruminococcus, and an increased abundance of 16 taxa including 
Enterococcus and Staphylococcus. Exposure to Beta-lactam antibiotics was 
associated with an increased abundance of 10 taxa including Enterococcus and a 
decreased abundance of 5 taxa including Eubacterium while exposure to FQ 
antibiotics was associated with an increased abundance of 3 taxa and a decreased 
abundance of 4 taxa including Ruminococcus.
CONCLUSIONS: Beta-lactam antibiotics and FQ antibiotics have a profound impact 
on the gut microbiota in kidney transplant recipients. Given the link of the gut 
microbiota to infectious complications, antibiotic associated changes in the 
microbiota may lead to an increased risk for further infections.

Antibiotics are known to cause loose stools, disrupt the fecal microbiota, and 
alter fecal bile acid (BA) profiles of dogs. Recovery may be aided by diet, but 
little research has been conducted. The objective of this study was to determine 
how a veterinary low-fat diet affected the fecal characteristics, metabolites, 
BA, and microbiota of dogs receiving antibiotics. Twenty-four healthy adult dogs 
[7.38 ± 1.95 yr; 7.67 ± 0.76 kg body weight (BW)] were used in an 8-wk 
completely randomized design study. During a 2-wk baseline, all dogs were fed a 
leading grocery brand diet (GBD). Over the next 2 wk, dogs were fed GBD and 
received metronidazole orally (20 mg/kg BW twice daily). At week 4, dogs were 
randomly allotted to one of two treatments [GBD or Blue Buffalo Natural 
Veterinary Diet GI Gastrointestinal Support Low-Fat (BB)] and fed for 4 wk. 
Fecal scores were recorded daily and fresh fecal samples were collected at weeks 
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 for measurement of pH, dry matter content, and metabolite 
and BA concentrations. Fecal microbiota populations were analyzed using 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR-based dysbiosis index (DI). All data were 
analyzed as repeated measures using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS 9.4, 
testing for effects of treatment, time, and treatment*time and significance set 
at P < 0.05. Metronidazole increased (P < 0.0001) fecal scores (looser stools), 
reduced fecal short-chain fatty acid, branched-chain fatty acid, phenol, and 
indole concentrations, increased primary BA concentrations, and decreased 
secondary BA concentrations. Metronidazole also reduced fecal bacterial alpha 
diversity, altered the abundance of 58 bacterial genera, and increased DI. 
During antibiotic recovery, changes in fecal pH, dry matter percentage, and 
metabolite and immunoglobulin A concentrations were altered (P < 0.05) by diet. 
Fecal BA concentrations recovered quickly for all dogs. Change in lithocholic 
acid was affected (P < 0.0001) by diet, but other BA were not. Recovery of over 
25 bacterial genera was impacted by diet (P < 0.05). While many bacterial taxa 
returned to baseline levels after 4 wk, others did not fully recover. DI and 
bacterial alpha diversity measures recovered quickly for all dogs but were not 
impacted by diet. In conclusion, metronidazole drastically altered the fecal 
microbiota and metabolites of dogs. While most variables returned to baseline by 
week 8, diet may be used to aid in recovery.

Plain Language Summary: The objective of this study was to determine how a 
veterinary gastrointestinal low-fat diet impacts the fecal characteristics, 
metabolites, and microbiota concentrations of adult dogs treated with 
metronidazole. All dogs were fed a leading grocery brand diet (GBD) during a 
2-wk baseline, dosed orally with metronidazole (20 mg/kg BW twice daily) for 
2 wk, then randomly allotted to one of two treatments (GBD or Blue Buffalo 
Natural Veterinary Diet GI Gastrointestinal Support Low-Fat) and fed for 4 wk. 
Fecal scores were recorded daily and fresh fecal samples were collected at weeks 
2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to assess fecal characteristics, microbiota populations, 
and metabolite and bile acid (BA) concentrations. Metronidazole increased fecal 
scores (looser stools), altered relative abundances of 58 bacterial genera and 
BA profiles (increased primary BA; reduced secondary BA), and increased 
dysbiosis index. While BA concentrations recovered quickly, some bacterial taxa 
did not fully recover after 4 wk. Recovery of over 25 bacterial genera was 
impacted by diet. Dysbiosis index and bacterial alpha diversity were not 
affected by diet. While most variables returned to pre-antibiotic levels by week 
8, these results demonstrate that diet may aid in the recovery of many important 
microbial markers.

This study systematically investigated the effects of temperature changes on the 
degradation of antibiotics in soil, as well as the alterations in microbial 
community structure and aggregation, through a field warming experiment in a 
greenhouse. Compared to non-warming soil, the warming treatment significantly 
accelerated the degradation rate of tetracyclines during soil freezing and 
mitigated the impact of environmental fluctuations on soil microbial 
communities. The greenhouse environment promoted the growth and reproduction of 
a wide range of microbial taxa, but the abundance of Myxococcota was positively 
correlated with antibiotic concentrations in both treatments, suggesting a 
potential specific association with antibiotic degradation processes. Long-term 
warming in the greenhouse led to a shift in the assembly process of soil 
microbial communities, with a decrease in dispersal limitation and an increase 
in the drift process. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis revealed a 
more loosely structured microbial community in the greenhouse soil, along with 
the emergence of new characteristic taxa. Notably, more than 60% of the key taxa 
that connected the co-occurrence networks in both groups belonged to rare taxa, 
indicating that rare taxa play a crucial role in maintaining community structure 
and function.

Eriocheir sinensis is the main aquaculture species in China. With the continuous 
expansion of the aquaculture scale, the demand for E. sinensis seedlings was 
also increased. The water used in breeding has well-nourished and its discharge 
into the sea posed significant risks. This study sampled the wastewater 
discharge points of the E. sinensis seedlings in Sheyang County, Jiangsu 
Province, and the areas far from the discharge points that were not affected in 
March and May 2023, respectively. A large number of antibiotic resistance genes 
(ARGs) were found in the sediment of the wastewater discharge area, and the 
highest ARG was sulfonamide ARG-sul1 using qPCR analysis, while ARGs were almost 
undetectable in the areas not affected by wastewater discharge. The 16S rRNA 
sequence analysis results showed that the main bacterial phyla at the wastewater 
discharge point were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Thermodesulfobacteria. 
In the control point, the main bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, 
Chlorobacterium, and Thermodesulfobacteria. There were significant differences 
in the composition of microbial communities between the two points, and the 
samples at the wastewater discharge point were more clustered and had higher 
similarity. The correlation network and redundancy analysis indicated that the 
phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria at the wastewater discharge 
points were positively correlated with most ARGs. The wastewater discharge had 
no effect on heavy metals from the two points. This study sets a foundation for 
future research by identifying key microbial taxa as potential ARG carriers and 
examining the interactions between microbial communities, ARGs, and heavy 
metals.

This study discussed the role of plant-associated microbiome in regulating ARG 
transfer in soil-plant systems. Results showed that target ARGs in plants were 
mainly derived from rhizosphere soil. Cooperative interactions among bacteria in 
rhizosphere soil, plant-roots, plant-shoots, and soil-roots-shoots systems 
occurred during ARG transfer. The number of modules and keystone taxa identified 
as positively correlated with ARG transfer in rhizosphere soil, roots, and 
shoots was 3 and 49, 3 and 41, 2 and 5, respectively. Among these modules, 
module 3 in roots was significantly positively correlated with module 3 in 
rhizosphere soils and module 2 in shoots, indicating that module 3 in roots 
played central hub roles in ARG transfer from rhizosphere soil to roost and 
shoots. This may be because module 3 in roots increased cell motility and 
xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. These keystone taxa mainly belonged 
to Proteobacteria that can carry ARGs to transfer in soil-plant systems, 
especially Clostridium-sensu_stricito and Pseudomonas in rhizosphere soil 
carried ARGs into the shoot. Additionally, they promoted ARG transfer by 
increasing plant biomass, net photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency. The 
findings helped reveal the mechanism of plant-associated bacterial interactions 
and provided understanding for potential risks of ARG transfer from soil to 
plants.

Specialized host-microbe symbioses are ecological communities, whose composition 
is shaped by various processes. Microbial community assembly in these symbioses 
is determined in part by interactions between taxa that colonize ecological 
niches available within habitat patches. The outcomes of these interactions, and 
by extension the trajectory of community assembly, can display priority 
effects-dependency on the order in which taxa first occupy these niches. The 
underlying mechanisms of these phenomena vary from system to system and are 
often not well resolved. Here, we characterize priority effects in colonization 
of the squash bug (Anasa tristis) by bacterial symbionts from the genus 
Caballeronia, using pairs of strains that are known to strongly compete during 
host colonization, as well as strains that are isogenic and thus functionally 
identical. By introducing symbiont strains into individual bugs in a sequential 
manner, we show that within-host populations established by the first colonist 
are extremely resistant to invasion, regardless of strain identity and 
competitive interactions. By knocking down the population of an initial colonist 
with antibiotics, we further show that colonization success by the second 
symbiont is still diminished even when space in the symbiotic organ is available 
and ostensibly accessible for colonization. We speculate that resident symbionts 
exclude subsequent infections by manipulating the host environment, partially 
but not exclusively by eliciting tissue remodeling of the symbiont organ.
IMPORTANCE: Host-associated microbial communities underpin critical ecosystem 
processes and human health, and their ability to do so is determined in turn by 
the various processes that shape their composition. While selection 
deterministically acts on competing genotypes and species during community 
assembly, the manner by which selection determines the trajectory of community 
assembly can differ depending on the sequence by which taxa are established 
within that community. We document this phenomenon, known as a priority effect, 
during experimental colonization of a North American insect pest, the squash bug 
Anasa tristis, by its betaproteobacterial symbionts in the genus Caballeronia. 
Our study demonstrates how stark, strain-level variation can emerge in 
specialized host-microbe symbioses simply through differences in the order by 
which strains colonize the host. Understanding the mechanistic drivers of 
community structure in host-associated microbiomes can highlight both pitfalls 
and opportunities for the engineering of these communities and their constituent 
taxa for societal benefit.

Organic pollutants can alter the physicochemical properties and microbial 
communities of water bodies. In water contaminated with organic pollutants, the 
unique extracellular electron transfer mechanisms that promote sulfamethoxazole 
(SMX) degradation in tri-electrode microbial electrochemical systems (TE-MES) 
may be impacted. To simulate biodegradable organic matter contamination, glucose 
(GLU) was added. Metagenomics and metabolomics were used to analyze changes in 
microbial community structure, metabolism, and function on the electrodes. GLU 
addition accelerated water quality deterioration, and enhanced SMX degradation. 
Microbial taxa on the electrodes experienced selective enrichment. Notably, 
methanogens and SMX-degrading bacteria were enriched, while denitrifying 
bacteria and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were suppressed. Enriched metabolites 
were linked to 15 metabolic pathways and other functions like microbial 
signaling and genetics. Non-redundant genes also clustered in metabolic 
pathways, aligning with metabolite enrichment results. Additional pathways 
involved life cycle processes and protein interactions. Enzymes related to 
carbon metabolism, particularly glycoside hydrolases, increased significantly, 
indicating a shift in carbon metabolism on microbial electrodes after GLU 
addition. The abundance of intracellular electron transfer enzymes rose, while 
outer membrane proteins decreased. This contrasts with the typical TE-MES 
mechanism where outer membrane proteins facilitate SMX degradation. The presence 
of organic pollution may shift SMX degradation from an extracellular 
electrochemical process to an intracellular metabolic process, possibly 
involving co-metabolism with simple organic compounds. This study provides 
mechanistic insights and theoretical guidance for using TE-MES with embedded 
microbial electrodes to treat antibiotic-contaminated water affected by organic 
pollution.

Rationale: Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has been implicated in cognitive 
deficits and gastrointestinal dysfunction in humans, with the gut microbiota 
emerging as a pivotal mediator of these diet-associated pathologies. The 
introduction of plant-based polysaccharides into the diet as a therapeutic 
strategy to alleviate such conditions is gaining attention. Nevertheless, the 
mechanistic paradigm by which polysaccharides modulate the gut microbiota 
remains largely undefined. This study investigated the mechanisms of action of 
Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides (EPs) in mitigating gut dysbiosis and examined 
their contribution to rectifying diet-related cognitive decline. Methods: 
Initially, we employed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and gut microbiota 
depletion to verify the causative role of changes in the gut microbiota induced 
by HFD in synapse engulfment-dependent cognitive impairments. Subsequently, 
colonization of the gut of chow-fed mice with Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 
HFD mice confirmed that inhibition of Proteobacteria by EPs was a necessary 
prerequisite for alleviating HFD-induced cognitive impairments. Finally, 
supplementation of HFD mice with butyrate and treatment of EPs mice with GW9662 
demonstrated that EPs inhibited the expansion of Proteobacteria in the colon of 
HFD mice by reshaping the interactions between the gut microbiota and 
colonocytes. Results: Findings from FMT and antibiotic treatments demonstrated 
that HFD-induced cognitive impairments pertaining to neuronal spine loss were 
contingent on gut microbial composition. Association analysis revealed strong 
associations between bacterial taxa belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria and 
cognitive performance in mice. Further, introducing E. coli from HFD-fed mice 
into standard diet-fed mice underscored the integral role of Proteobacteria 
proliferation in triggering excessive synaptic engulfment-related cognitive 
deficits in HFD mice. Crucially, EPs effectively counteracted the bloom of 
Proteobacteria and subsequent neuroinflammatory responses mediated by microglia, 
essential for cognitive improvement in HFD-fed mice. Mechanistic insights 
revealed that EPs promoted the production of bacteria-derived butyrate, thereby 
ameliorating HFD-induced colonic mitochondrial dysfunction and reshaping 
colonocyte metabolism. This adjustment curtailed the availability of growth 
substrates for facultative anaerobes, which in turn limited the uncontrolled 
expansion of Proteobacteria. Conclusions: Our study elucidates that colonocyte 
metabolic disturbances, which promote Proteobacteria overgrowth, are a likely 
cause of HFD-induced cognitive deficits. Furthermore, dietary supplementation 
with EPs can rectify behavioral dysfunctions associated with HFD by modifying 
gut microbiota-colonocyte interactions. These insights contribute to the broader 
understanding of the modulatory effects of plant prebiotics on the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis and suggest a potential therapeutic avenue for 
diet-associated cognitive dysfunction.

In human microbiome studies, mediation analysis has recently been spotlighted as 
a practical and powerful analytic tool to survey the causal roles of the 
microbiome as a mediator to explain the observed relationships between a medical 
treatment/environmental exposure and a human disease. We also note that, in a 
clinical research, investigators often trace disease progression sequentially in 
time; as such, time-to-event (e.g., time-to-disease, time-to-cure) responses, 
known as survival responses, are prevalent as a surrogate variable for human 
health or disease. In this paper, we introduce a web cloud computing platform, 
named as microbiome mediation analysis with survival responses (MiMedSurv), for 
comprehensive microbiome mediation analysis with survival responses on 
user-friendly web environments. MiMedSurv is an extension of our prior web cloud 
computing platform, named as microbiome mediation analysis (MiMed), for survival 
responses. The two main features that are well-distinguished are as follows. 
First, MiMedSurv conducts some baseline exploratory non-mediational survival 
analysis, not involving microbiome, to survey the disparity in survival response 
between medical treatments/environmental exposures. Then, MiMedSurv identifies 
the mediating roles of the microbiome in various aspects: (i) as a microbial 
ecosystem using ecological indices (e.g., alpha and beta diversity indices) and 
(ii) as individual microbial taxa in various hierarchies (e.g., phyla, classes, 
orders, families, genera, species). To illustrate its use, we survey the 
mediating roles of the gut microbiome between antibiotic treatment and 
time-to-type 1 diabetes. MiMedSurv is freely available on our web server ( 
http://mimedsurv.micloud.kr ).

treatment increases microbiome diversity and enriches health associated taxa.

Antibiotic-induced microbiome injury, defined as a reduction of ecological 
diversity and obligate anaerobe taxa, is associated with negative health 
outcomes in hospitalized patients, and healthy individuals who received 
antibiotics in the past are at higher risk for autoimmune diseases. No 
interventions are currently available that effectively target the microbial 
ecosystem in the gut to prevent this negative collateral damage of antibiotics. 
Here, we present the results from a single-center, randomized placebo-controlled 
trial involving 32 patients who received an oral, fermentation-derived 
postbiotic alongside oral antibiotic therapy for gastrointestinal (GI)-unrelated 
infections. Postbiotics comprise complex mixtures of metabolites produced by 
bacteria during fermentation and other processes, which can mediate microbial 
ecology. Bacterial ecosystem alpha diversity, quantified by the inverse Simpson 
index, during the end of the antibiotic course was significantly higher (+40%) 
across the 16 postbiotic-treated patients compared with the 16 patients who 
received a placebo, and the postbiotic was well-tolerated. Secondary analyses of 
157 stool samples collected longitudinally revealed that the increased diversity 
was driven by enrichment in health-associated microbial genera: obligate 
anaerobe Firmicutes, in particular taxa belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family, 
were higher in treated patients; conversely, Escherichia/Shigella abundances, 
which comprise pathobionts and antimicrobial-resistant strains, were reduced in 
postbiotic-treated patients at the end of their antibiotic course and up to 10 
days later. Taken together, these results indicate that postbiotic 
co-administration during antibiotic therapy could support a health-associated 
gut microbiome community and may reduce antibiotic-induced microbiome injury.

This study evaluates the dynamic shift in the microbiota at the peri-implant 
site of titanium (Ti) and zirconia (Zr) implants subjected to experimental 
peri-implantitis (PI) and, for the first time, of implants made of 
ceria-stabilized alumina-reinforced zirconia (Ce-TZP/Al), a revolutionary 
zirconia that is set to play a key role in modern implant dentistry. One- and 
two-piece (TP) implants, including Ce-TZP/AL TP/G3 glass, were placed 
bilaterally (six implants/side) in five beagle dogs to mimic a natural vs. 
ligature-induced PI following a split-mouth design. The experiment spanned 30 
weeks from tooth extraction. Both PI models promoted plaque deposition at 
peri-implant sites. Comparatively, the PI induced by ligatures favored the 
deposition of anaerobes (p = 0.047 vs. natural). Regardless of the model, the 
plaque deposition pattern was entirely dependent on the implanted material. 
Ligated Ti and Zr implant sites accumulated up to 2.14 log CFU/mL unit anaerobic 
load (p ≤ 0.033 vs. non-ligated implant sites), predominantly comprising 
obligate anaerobes. Naturally occurring PI induced the deposition of 
co-occurring networks of obligate anaerobes and less oxygen-dependent bacteria. 
PI induction favored the enrichment of Ti and Zr sites with bacterial taxa 
belonging to the orange and red complexes (up to 28% increase naturally and up 
to 71% in the ligated hemiarch). Anaerobic deposition was significantly lower in 
ligated Ce-TZP/Al implant sites (p ≤ 0.014 vs. TI and Zr) and independent of the 
induction model (0.63-1 log units of increase). Facultative bacteria prevailed 
at Ce-TZP/AL sites. The abundance was lower in the Ce-TZP/AL TP implant. Unlike 
Ti and Zr sites, taxa from the orange and red complexes were negligible. 
Biofilms configured at the Ti and Zr sites after ligation-induced PI resemble 
those found in severe IP. We hypothesize that, although surface properties 
(surface energy and surface roughness) and physicochemical properties of the 
substrate play an important role in bacterial adhesion and subsequent plaque 
formation, Ce-TZP/Al modulates several biological activities that preserve the 
integrity of the gingival seal by limiting PI progression. In conclusion, 
biofilm progression differs in peri-implant sites according to the specific 
properties of the material. Ce-TZP/A, unlike titanium or zirconia, prevents 
dysbiosis in sites subjected to experimental PI and preserves the microbial 
signature of emergent obligate anaerobes related to PI development.

BACKGROUND: Enterobacter species are included among the normal human gut 
microflora and persist in a diverse range of other environmental niches. They 
have become important opportunistic nosocomial pathogens known to harbour 
plasmid-mediated multi-class antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants. Global 
AMR surveillance of Enterobacterales isolates shows the genus is second to 
Klebsiella in terms of frequency of carbapenem resistance. Enterobacter taxonomy 
is confusing and standard species identification methods are largely inaccurate 
or insufficient. There are currently 27 named species and a total of 46 taxa in 
the genus distinguishable via average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculation 
between pairs of genomic sequences. Here we describe an Enterobacter strain, 
ECC3473, isolated from the wastewater of an Australian hospital whose species 
could not be determined by standard methods nor by ribosomal RNA gene 
multi-locus typing.
AIM: To characterise ECC3473 in terms of phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial 
resistance, biochemical characteristics and taxonomy as well as to determine the 
global distribution of the novel species to which it belongs.
METHODS: Standard broth dilution and disk diffusion were used to determine 
phenotypic AMR. The strain's complete genome, including plasmids, was obtained 
following long- and short read sequencing and a novel long/short read hybrid 
assembly and polishing, and the genomic basis of AMR was determined. 
Phylogenomic analysis and quantitative measures of relatedness (ANI, digital 
DNA-DNA hybridisation, and difference in G+C content) were used to study the 
taxonomic relationship between ECC3473 and Enterobacter type-strains. NCBI and 
PubMLST databases and the literature were searched for additional members of the 
novel species to determine its global distribution.
RESULTS: ECC3473 is one of 21 strains isolated globally belonging to a novel 
Enterobacter species for which the name, Enterobacter adelaidei sp. nov. is 
proposed. The novel species was found to be resilient in its capacity to persist 
in contaminated water and adaptable in its ability to accumulate multiple 
transmissible AMR determinants.
CONCLUSION: E. adelaidei sp. nov. may become increasingly important to the 
dissemination of AMR.

SUMMARYThe human microbiota encompasses the diverse communities of 
microorganisms that reside in, on, and around various parts of the human body, 
such as the skin, nasal passages, and gastrointestinal tract. Although research 
is ongoing, it is well established that the microbiota exert a substantial 
influence on the body through the production and modification of metabolites and 
small molecules. Disruptions in the composition of the microbiota-dysbiosis-have 
also been linked to various negative health outcomes. As humans embark upon 
longer-duration space missions, it is important to understand how the conditions 
of space travel impact the microbiota and, consequently, astronaut health. This 
article will first characterize the main taxa of the human gut microbiota and 
their associated metabolites, before discussing potential dysbiosis and negative 
health consequences. It will also detail the microbial changes observed in 
astronauts during spaceflight, focusing on gut microbiota composition and 
pathogenic virulence and survival. Analysis will then turn to how astronaut 
health may be protected from adverse microbial changes via diet, exercise, and 
antibiotics before concluding with a discussion of the microbiota of spacecraft 
and microbial culturing methods in space. The implications of this review are 
critical, particularly with NASA's ongoing implementation of the Moon to Mars 
Architecture, which will include weeks or months of living in space and new 
habitats.

Colonization of the infant gut is an important developmental process 
characterized by high carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and high 
abundances of pathobionts. The horizontal transfer of ARGs to pathogenic 
bacteria represents a major public health concern. However, there is still a 
paucity of longitudinal studies surveilling ARGs in healthy infant guts at high 
temporal resolution. Furthermore, we do not yet have a clear view of how 
temporal variation in ARG carriage relates to the dynamics of specific bacterial 
populations, as well as community virulence potential. Here, we performed deep 
shotgun metagenomic sequencing of monthly fecal samples from a cohort of 12 
infants, covering the first year of life to interrogate the infant gut 
microbiome for ARG content. We further relate ARG dynamics to the dynamics of 
taxa, virulence potential, as well as the potential for ARG mobilization. We 
identify a core resistome dominated by efflux systems typically associated with 
Enterobacteriaceae. Overall ARG carriage declined over the first year of life 
and showed strong contemporaneous correlation with the population dynamics of 
Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the majority of ARGs could be further mapped to 
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) classified to this phylum. We were able to 
assign a large number of ARGs to E. coli by correlating the temporal dynamics of 
individual genes with species dynamics, and we show that the temporal dynamics 
of ARGs and virulence factors are highly correlated, suggesting close taxonomic 
associations between these two gene classes. Finally, we identify ARGs linked 
with various categories of mobile genetic elements, demonstrating preferential 
linkage among mobility categories and resistance to different drug classes. 
While individual variation in ARG carriage is substantial during infancy there 
is a clear reduction over the first year of life. With few exceptions, ARG 
abundances closely track the dynamics of pathobionts and community virulence 
potential. These findings emphasize the potential for development of resistant 
pathogens in the developing infant gut, and the importance of effective 
surveillance in order to detect such events.

Anaerobic bacteria in chronic wounds: Roles in disease, infection and treatment 
failure.

Infection is among the most common factors that impede wound healing, yet 
standard treatments routinely fail to resolve chronic wound infections. The 
chronic wound environment is largely hypoxic/anoxic, and wounds are 
predominantly colonised by facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. Oxygen 
(O2) limitation is an underappreciated driver of microbiota composition and 
behaviour in chronic wounds. In this perspective article, we examine how 
anaerobic bacteria and their distinct physiologies support persistent, 
antibiotic-recalcitrant infections. We describe the anaerobic energy metabolisms 
bacteria rely on for long-term survival in the wound environment, and why many 
antibiotics become less effective under hypoxic conditions. We also discuss 
obligate anaerobes, which are among the most prevalent taxa to colonise chronic 
wounds, yet their potential roles in influencing the microbial community and 
wound healing have been overlooked. All of the most common obligate anaerobes 
found in chronic wounds are opportunistic pathogens. We consider how these 
organisms persist in the wound environment and interface with host physiology to 
hinder wound healing processes or promote chronic inflammation. Finally, we 
apply our understanding of anaerobic physiologies to evaluate current treatment

Intensive broiler production systems face challenges like enteric diseases, 
impacting global food security. Strategies to enhance broiler immunity and gut 
health, particularly amidst antibiotic growth promoter restrictions, are 
crucial. The present study investigated the combined effects of fenugreek seeds 
(FS) and Bacillus-based direct-fed microbials (DFM) on immune-related gene 
expression in the ileum and alteration of microbial population in the cecum of 
broiler. The study involved 160 Ross 308 broiler chicks, which were divided into 
four groups consisting of 5 replicates, each containing eight birds. The chicks 
were grown for a period of 42 d, during which they had ad libitum access to feed 
and water. Dietary treatments were: Control (basal diet), FS5 (basal + 5g/kg 
fenugreek seeds), FS5DFM (basal + 5g/kg fenugreek seeds + 0.1g/kg Bacillus-based 
DFM), and DFM (basal + 0.1g/kg Bacillus-based DFM). Ileum tissue and cecal 
contents were collected on d 42 for gene expression and gut microbiome analysis. 
Ileal gene expression analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-6, IL-8L2, 
CASP6, PTGS2, and IRF7 in both FSs and DFMs groups compared to the control, 
suggesting individual immunomodulatory effects. However, avian β-defensin genes 
exhibited complex regulation, highlighting the need for further investigation. 
Cecal microbiome diversity remained stable, with subtle shifts in specific taxa 
influenced by FSs and DFMs. Interestingly, the combination of the FSs and DFMs 
uniquely impacted specific taxa, including Clostridiales vadin BB60. These 
findings suggest that both FSs and DFMs demonstrated potential for improving 
broiler immunity through inflammation reduction. The combination of FSs and DFMs 
offers a synergistic effect in immune modulation and specific microbial 
modulation, warranting further investigation with pathogen challenge models for 
comprehensive understanding.

Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria have been an increasing problem in human 
medicine and animal husbandry since the introduction of antimicrobials on the 
market in the 1940s. Over the last decades, efforts to reduce antimicrobial 
usage in animal husbandry have been shown to limit the development of resistant 
bacteria. Despite this, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are still commonly 
detected and isolated worldwide. In this study, we investigated the presence of 
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in bovine milk samples using a multiple 
approach based on culturing and amplicon sequencing. We first enriched milk 
samples obtained aseptically from bovine udders in the presence of two 
antimicrobials commonly used to treat mastitis and then described the resistant 
microbiota by amplicon sequencing and isolate characterization. Our results show 
that several commensal species and mastitis pathogens harbor antimicrobial 
resistance and dominate the enriched microbiota in milk in presence of 
antimicrobial agents. The use of the two different antimicrobials selected for 
different bacterial taxa and affected the overall microbial composition. These 
results provide new information on how different antimicrobials can shape the 
microbiota which is able to survive and reestablish in the udder and point to 
the fact that antimicrobial resistance is widely spread also in commensal 
species.

Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) has shown some success in treating 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). There is emerging evidence that host 
engraftment of donor taxa is a tenet of successful FMT. We undertook a 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to characterize the 
response to FMT in children and young adults with mild to moderate active 
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Subjects with CD or UC were 
randomized to receive antibiotics and weekly FMT or placebo in addition to 
baseline medications. We enrolled 15 subjects aged 14-29 years. Four subjects 
had CD, and 11 had UC. Subjects exhibited a wide range of microbial diversity 
and donor engraftment. Specifically, engraftment ranged from 26 to 90% at week 2 
and 3-92% at 2 months. Consistent with the current literature, increases over 
time of both alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and donor engraftment (p < 0.05) 
correlated with improved clinical response. We discovered that the 
post-antibiotic but pre-FMT time point was rich in microbial correlates of 
eventual engraftment. Greater residual alpha diversity after antibiotic 
treatment was positively correlated with engraftment and subsequent clinical 
response. Interestingly, a transient rise in the relative abundance of 
Lactobacillus was also positively correlated with engraftment, a finding that we 
recapitulated with our analysis of another FMT trial.

High-throughput sequencing studies have shown that diet or antimicrobial 
treatments impact animal gut microbiota equilibrium. However, properties related 
to the gut microbial ecosystem stability, such as resilience, resistance, or 
functional redundancy, must be better understood. To shed light on these 
ecological processes, we combined advanced statistical methods with 16 S rRNA 
gene sequencing, functional prediction, and fitness analyses in the gut 
microbiota of the cockroach Blattella germanica subject to three periodic pulses 
of the antibiotic (AB) kanamycin (n=512). We first confirmed that AB did not 
significantly affect cockroaches' biological fitness, and gut microbiota changes 
were not caused by insect physiology alterations. The sex variable was examined 
for the first time in this species, and no statistical differences in the gut 
microbiota diversity or composition were found. The comparison of the gut 
microbiota dynamics in control and treated populations revealed that (1) AB 
treatment decreases diversity and completely disrupts the co-occurrence networks 
between bacteria, significantly altering the gut community structure. (2) 
Although AB also affected the genetic composition, functional redundancy would 
explain a smaller effect on the functional potential than on the taxonomic 
composition. (3) As predicted by Taylor's law, AB generally affected the most 
abundant taxa to a lesser extent than the less abundant taxa. (4) Taxa follow 
different trends in response to ABs, highlighting "resistant taxa," which could 
be critical for community restoration. (5) The gut microbiota recovered faster 
after the three AB pulses, suggesting that gut microbiota adapts to repeated 
treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Stringent regulations in pig farming, such as antibiotic control 
and the ban on certain additives and disinfectants, complicate disease control 
efforts. Despite the evolution of microbial communities inside the house 
environment, they maintain stability over the years, exhibiting characteristics 
specific to each type of production and, in some cases, unique to a particular 
company or farm production type. In addition, some infectious diseases are 
recurrent in specific farms, while other farms never present these diseases, 
suggesting a connection between the presence of these microorganisms in animals 
or their environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterise 
environmental microbiomes of farms with high and low sanitary status, 
establishing the relationships between both, health status, environmental 
microbial ecology and its functionality.
METHODS: For this purpose, 6 pig farms were environmentally sampled. Farms were 
affiliated with a production company that handle the majority of the pigs 
slaughtered in Spain. This study investigated the relationship among high health 
and low health status farms using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In 
addition, to identify ecologically relevant functions and potential pathogens 
based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained, functional Annotation with 
PROkaryotic TAXa (FAPROTAX) was performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This study reveals notable differences in microbial 
communities between farms with persistent health issues and those with good 
health outcomes, suggesting a need for protocols tailored to address specific 
challenges. The variation in microbial populations among farms underscores the 
need for specific and eco-friendly cleaning and disinfection protocols. These 
measures are key to enhancing the sustainability of livestock farming, ensuring 
safer products and boosting competitive edge in the market.

Microalgae can promote antibiotic removal, which has attracted growing 
attention. However, its synergistic removal performance with bacteria in 
antibiotic pollutants is still poorly understood. In this study, firstly, we 
selected two green algae (Dictyosphaerium sp. and Chlorella sp.) and exposed 
them to Enrofloxacin (ENR) to observe their extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) 
concentration dynamic and the removal of antibiotics. Secondly, EPS was 
extracted and added to in situ lake water (no algae) to investigate its combined 
effect with bacteria. The results indicate that both Dictyosphaerium sp. and 
Chlorella sp. exhibited high tolerance to ENR stress. When the biomass of 
microalgae was low, ENR could significantly stimulate algae to produce EPS. The 
removal rates of Dictyosphaerium sp. and Chlorella sp. were 15.8% and 10.5%, 
respectively. The addition of EPS can both alter the microbial community 
structure in the lake water and promote the removal of ENR. The LEfSe analysis 
showed that there were significant differences in the microbial marker taxa, 
which promoted the increase of special functional bacteria for decomposing ENR, 
between the EPS-added group and the control group. The EPS of Dictyosphaerium 
sp. increased the abundance of Moraxellaceae and Spirosomaceae, while the EPS of 
Chlorella sp. increased the abundance of Sphingomonadaceae and 
Microbacteriaceae. Under the synergistic effect, Chlorella sp. achieved a 
maximum removal rate of 24.2%, while Dictyosphaerium sp. achieved a maximum 
removal rate of 28.9%. Our study provides new insights into the removal 
performance and mechanism of antibiotics by freshwater microalgae in water 
bodies and contribute to the development of more effective water treatment 
strategies.

Just as the human gut microbiome is colonized by a variety of microbes, so too 
is the rhizosphere of plants. An imbalance in this microbial community, known as 
dysbiosis, can have a negative impact on plant health. This study sought to 
explore the effect of rhizosphere dysbiosis on the health of tomato plants 
(Solanum lycopersicum L.), using them and the foliar bacterial spot pathogen 
Xanthomonas perforans as model organisms. The rhizospheres of 3-week-old tomato 
plants were treated with either streptomycin or water as a control, and then 
spray-inoculated with X. perforans after 24 h. Half of the plants that were 
treated with both streptomycin and X. perforans received soil microbiome 
transplants from uninfected plant donors 48 h after the streptomycin was 
applied. The plants treated with streptomycin showed a 26% increase in disease 
severity compared to those that did not receive the antibiotic. However, the 
plants that received the soil microbiome transplant exhibited an intermediate 
level of disease severity. The antibiotic-treated plants demonstrated a reduced 
abundance of rhizobacterial taxa such as Cyanobacteria from the genus 
Cylindrospermum. They also showed a down-regulation of genes related to plant 
primary and secondary metabolism, and an up-regulation of plant defence genes 
associated with induced systemic resistance. This study highlights the vital 
role that beneficial rhizosphere microbes play in disease resistance, even 
against foliar pathogens.

Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities with FAVA.

Microbial communities vary across space, time, and individual hosts, presenting 
new challenges for the development of statistics measuring the variability of 
community composition. To understand differences across microbiome samples from 
different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental 
replicates, we present FAVA, a new normalized measure for characterizing 
compositional variability across multiple microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies 
variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances 
in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are 
identical and equaling 1 when each sample is entirely comprised of a single 
taxon. Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic FST , with 
samples playing the role of "populations" and taxa playing the role of 
"alleles." Its convenient mathematical properties allow users to compare 
disparate data sets. For example, FAVA values are commensurable across different 
numbers of taxonomic categories and different numbers of samples considered. We 
introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and 
spatial or temporal distances between samples. We illustrate how FAVA can be 
used to describe across-individual taxonomic variability in ruminant microbiomes 
at different regions along the gastrointestinal tract. In a second example, a 
longitudinal analysis of gut microbiomes of healthy human adults taking an 
antibiotic, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of 
microbiomes following the antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the 
antibiotic's influence on microbial variability. We have implemented this tool 
in an R package, FAVA, which can fit easily into existing pipelines for the 
analysis of microbial relative abundances.

The ongoing and progressive evolution of antibiotic resistance presents 
escalating challenges for the clinical management and prevention of bacterial 
infections. Understanding the makeup of resistance genomes and accurately 
quantifying the current abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are 
crucial for assessing the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to public 
health. This comprehensive study investigated the distribution and diversity of 
bacterial community composition, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs) across human, 
chicken, pig fecal, and soil microbiomes in various provinces of China. As a 
result, multidrug resistance was identified across all samples. Core ARGs 
primarily related to multidrug, MLS (Macrolides-Lincosamide-Streptogramins), and 
tetracycline resistance were characterized. A significant correlation between 
ARGs and bacterial taxa was observed, especially in soil samples. Probiotic 
strains such as Lactobacillus harbored ARGs, potentially contributing to the 
dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We screened subsets of ARGs from samples 
from different sources as indicators to assess the level of ARGs contamination 
in samples, with high accuracy. These results underline the complex relationship 
between microbial communities, resistance mechanisms, and environmental factors, 
emphasizing the importance of continued research and monitoring to better 
understand these dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence is revealing the impact of the gut microbiome on 
hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation. Prior studies postulate that this 
influence is mediated by bioactive metabolites produced by gut-dwelling 
commensal bacteria. However, gut microbial metabolite production has not 
previously been measured among heart transplant (HT) recipients.
METHODS: In order to investigate the potential influence of the gut microbiome 
and its metabolites on HT, we analyzed the composition and metabolite production 
of the fecal microbiome among 48 HT recipients at the time of HT.
RESULTS: Compared to 20 healthy donors, HT recipients have significantly reduced 
alpha, i.e. within-sample, microbiota diversity, with significantly lower 
abundances of key anaerobic commensal bacteria and higher abundances of 
potentially pathogenic taxa that have been correlated with adverse outcomes in 
other forms of transplantation. HT recipients have a wide range of 
microbiota-derived fecal metabolite concentrations, with significantly reduced 
levels of immune modulatory metabolites such as short chain fatty acids and 
secondary bile acids compared to healthy donors. These differences were likely 
due to disease severity and prior antibiotic exposures but were not explained by 
other demographic or clinical factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Key potentially immune modulatory gut microbial metabolites are 
quantifiable and significantly reduced among HT recipients compared to healthy 
donors. Further study is needed to understand whether this wide range of gut 
microbial dysbiosis and metabolite alterations impact clinical outcomes and if 
they can be used as predictive biomarkers or manipulated to improve transplant 
outcomes.

Hospitals are subject to strict microbial control. Stringent cleaning and 
confinement measures in hospitals lead to a decrease in microbial diversity, but 
an increase in resistance genes. Given the rise of antimicrobial resistances and 
healthcare-associated infections, understanding the hospital microbiome and its 
resistome is crucial. This study compared the microbiome and resistome at 
different levels of confinement (CL) within a single hospital. Using amplicon 
sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and genome/plasmid reconstruction, we 
demonstrate that microbial composition differs in a stable way between the CLs 
and that the most restrictive confinement level CL1 had the lowest microbial but 
the highest functional diversity. This CL also exhibited a greater abundance of 
functions related to virulence, disease, defense, and stress response. 
Comparison of antibiotic resistance also showed differences among CLs in terms 
of the selection process and specific mechanisms for antimicrobial/antibiotic 
resistance. The resistances found in the samples of CL1 were mostly mediated via 
antibiotic efflux pumps and were mainly located on chromosomes, whereas in the 
other, less restrictive CL antibiotic resistances were more present on plasmids. 
This could be of particular importance for patient-related areas (CL2), as the 
potential spread of antibiotic resistances could be a major concern in this 
area. Our results show that there are differences in the microbiome and 
resistome even within a single hospital, reflecting room utilization and 
confinement. Since restrictive confinement selects for resistant microorganisms, 
strategies are required to deepen our understanding of dynamic processes of 
microbiome and resistome within hospital environments.
IMPORTANCE: Effective measures to combat antibiotic resistances and 
healthcare-associated infections are urgently needed, including optimization of 
microbial control. However, previous studies have indicated that stringent 
control can lead to an increase in the resistance capacities of microbiomes on 
surfaces. This study adds to previous knowledge by focusing on the conditions in 
a single hospital, resolving the microbiomes and their resistomes in three 
different confinement levels (CL): operating room, patient-related areas, and 
non-patient-related areas. We were able to identify stable key taxa; profiled 
the capacities of taxa, functions, and antimicrobial resistances (AMR); and 
reconstruct genomes and plasmids in each CL. Our results show that the most 
restrictive CL indeed had the highest functional diversity, but that resistances 
were mostly encoded on chromosomes, indicating a lower possibility of resistance 
spread. However, clever strategies are still required to strike a balance 
between microbial control and selective pressures in environments where patients 
need protection.

The gut microbiome is a dense and diverse community of different microorganisms 
that deeply influence human physiology and that have important interactions with 
pathogens. For the correct antibiotic treatment of infections, with its twin 
goals of effective inhibition of the pathogen and limitation of collateral 
damage to the microbiome, the identification of infectious organisms is key. 
Microbiological culturing is still the mainstay of pathogen identification, and 
anaerobic species are among the most demanding bacterial communities to culture. 
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of growth media on the culture of 
an-aerobic bacteria from human stool samples. Stool samples from eight human 
subjects were cultured each on a yeast extract cysteine blood agar (HCB) and a 
modified peptone-yeast extract-glucose (MPYG) plate and subjected to Illumina 
NGS analysis after DNA extraction and amplification. The results showed tight 
clustering of sequencing samples belonging to the same human subject. Various 
differences in bacterial richness and evenness could be observed between the two 
media, with HCB plates supporting the growth of a more diverse microbial 
community, and MPYG plates improving the growth rates of certain taxa. No 
statistical significance was observed between the groups. This study highlights 
the importance of choosing the appropriate growth media for anaerobic bacterial 
culture and adjusting culture conditions to target specific pathological 
conditions. HCB plates are suitable for standard microbiological diagnostics, 
while MPYG plates may be more appropriate for targeting specific conditions. 
This work emphasizes the role of next-generation sequencing in supporting future 
research in clinical microbiology.

The effectiveness of probiotics in preventing or reversing antibiotic-induced 
microbiome disruption remains uncertain, and claims of microbiome restoration to 
its pre-antibiotic state may be overestimated. In this review, we aimed to 
assess the efficacy of probiotics in preventing or ameliorating disruptions in 
microbiome composition and function induced by antibiotic treatment. We searched 
Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL for randomised controlled and non-randomised 
trials. Participants were individuals of any age who were on systemic 
antibiotics with a low risk of baseline dysbiosis. The intervention consisted of 
probiotics during or after antibiotic treatment, compared to placebo, 
alternative interventions, or no intervention. Outcomes included microbiome 
composition and diversity analysed using high-throughput molecular methods, 
alongside microbial function and resistome assessments. Seven studies, reported 
in eight papers, were reviewed. One study showed probiotics counteracting 
antibiotic-induced diversity changes, another showed exacerbation of these 
changes, and four others showed no effect. Effects on taxa abundance ranged from 
mitigating dysbiosis to selective modulation, no effect, or delayed recovery. 
One study observed no impact on the resistome, while another reported an 
increase in antibiotic resistance genes. In conclusion, heterogeneous results 
preclude a definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of any specific probiotic 
in restoring antibiotic-exposed microbiomes. For a clearer understanding, future 
research should be more standardised and long-term, employing advanced methods, 
such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing. These studies 
should strive to include larger, diverse populations to enhance generalisability 
and clearly define what constitutes a healthy microbiome. Finally, linking 
changes in the microbiome to specific clinical outcomes is essential for 
clinical decision making. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023446214.

Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a potentially life-threatening complication 
following colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. In this study, we aimed to unravel 
longitudinal changes in microbial structure before, during, and after surgery 
and to determine if microbial alterations may be predictive for risk assessment 
between sufficient anastomotic healing (AS) and AL prior surgery. We analysed 
the microbiota of 134 colon mucosal biopsies with 16S rRNA V1-V2 gene 
sequencing. Samples were collected from three location sites before, during, and 
after surgery, and patients received antibiotics after the initial collection 
and during surgery. The microbial structure showed dynamic surgery-related 
changes at different time points. Overall bacterial diversity and the abundance 
of some genera such as Faecalibacterium or Alistipes decreased over time, while 
the genera Enterococcus and Escherichia_Shigella increased. The distribution of 
taxa between AS and AL revealed significant differences in the abundance of 
genera such as Prevotella, Faecalibacterium and Phocaeicola. In addition to 
Phocaeicola, Ruminococcus2 and Blautia showed significant differences in 
abundance between preoperative sample types. ROC analysis of the predictive 
value of these genera for AL revealed an AUC of 0.802 (p = 0.0013). In summary, 
microbial composition was associated with postoperative outcomes, and the 
abundance of certain genera may be predictive of postoperative complications.

Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) aim to reduce contamination in effluent 
water; however, studies indicate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) persist 
post-treatment, potentially leading to their spread from human populated areas 
into the environment. This study evaluated the impact of a large WWTP serving 
125,000 people on the Iskar River in Bulgaria, by characterizing the spatial and 
short-term temporal dynamics in bacterial community dynamics and resistance 
profiles of the surface water. Pairs of samples were collected biweekly on four 
dates from two different locations, one about 800 m after the WWTP effluents and 
the other 10 km downstream. Taxonomic classification revealed the dominance of 
Pseudomonodota and Bacteriodota, notably the genera Flavobacterium, Aquirufa, 
Acidovorax, Polynucleobacter, and Limnohabitans. The taxonomic structure 
corresponded with both lentic and lotic freshwater habitats, with Flavobacterium 
exhibiting a significant decrease over the study period. Principal Coordinate 
Analysis revealed statistically significant differences in bacterial community 
composition between samples collected on different dates. Differential abundance 
analysis identified notable enrichment of Polynucleobacter and Limnohabitans. 
There were shifts within the enriched or depleted bacterial taxa between early 
and late sampling dates. High relative abundance of the genes erm(B), erm(F), 
mph(E), msr(E) (macrolides); tet(C), tet(O), tet(W), tet(Q) and tet(X) 
(tetracyclines); sul1 and sul2 (sulphonamides); and cfxA3, cfxA6 (beta-lactams) 
were detected, with trends of increased presence in the latest sampling dates 
and in the location closer to the WWTP. Of note, genes conferring resistance to 
carbapenems blaOXA-58 and blaIMP-33-like were identified. Co-occurrence analysis 
of ARGs and mobile genetic elements on putative plasmids showed few instances, 
and the estimated human health risk score (0.19) according to MetaCompare2.0 was 
low. In total, 29 metagenome-assembled genomes were recovered, with only a few 
harbouring ARGs. This study enhances our understanding of freshwater microbial 
community dynamics and antibiotic resistance profiles, highlighting the need for 
continued ARGs monitoring.

Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and other members of the complex microbiotas, whose 
activity is essential for vinegar production, display biodiversity and richness 
that is difficult to study in depth due to their highly selective culture 
conditions. In recent years, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for rapidly identifying 
thousands of proteins present in microbial communities, offering broader 
precision and coverage. In this work, a novel method based on LC-MS/MS was 
established and developed from previous studies. This methodology was tested in 
three studies, enabling the characterization of three submerged acetification 
profiles using innovative raw materials (synthetic alcohol medium, fine wine, 
and craft beer) while working in a semicontinuous mode. The biodiversity of 
existing microorganisms was clarified, and both the predominant taxa 
(Komagataeibacter, Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, and Gluconobacter) and others 
never detected in these media (Asaia and Bombella, among others) were 
identified. The key functions and adaptive metabolic strategies were determined 
using comparative studies, mainly those related to cellular material 
biosynthesis, energy-associated pathways, and cellular detoxification processes. 
This study provides the groundwork for a highly reliable and reproducible method 
for the characterization of microbial profiles in the vinegar industry.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most 
prevalent type of liver disease worldwide. The exact pathophysiology behind 
MASLD remains unclear; however, it is thought that a combination of factors or 
"hits" act as precipitants for disease onset and progression. Abundant evidence 
supports the roles of diet, genes, metabolic dysregulation, and the intestinal 
microbiome in influencing the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes and 
subsequent progression to inflammation and fibrosis. Currently, there is no cure 
for MASLD, but lifestyle changes have been the prevailing cornerstones of 
management. Research is now focusing on the intestinal microbiome as a potential 
therapeutic target for MASLD, with the spotlight shifting to probiotics, 
antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In this review, we provide an 
overview of how intestinal microbiota interact with the immune system to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated 
steatohepatitis (MASH). We also summarize key microbial taxa implicated in the 
disease and discuss evidence supporting microbial-targeted therapies in its 
management.

The infant gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a reservoir of 
antibiotic resistance genes, yet the assembly of gut resistome in infants and 
its influencing factors remain largely unknown. We characterized resistome in 
4132 metagenomes from 963 infants in six countries and 4285 resistance genes 
were observed. The inherent resistome pattern of healthy infants (N = 272) could 
be distinguished by two stages: a multicompound resistance phase (Months 0-7) 
and a tetracycline-mupirocin-β-lactam-dominant phase (Months 8-14). Microbial 
taxonomy explained 40.7% of the gut resistome of healthy infants, with 
Escherichia (25.5%) harboring the most resistance genes. In a further analysis 
with all available infants (N = 963), we found age was the strongest influencer 
on the resistome and was negatively correlated with the overall resistance 
during the first 3 years (p < 0.001). Using a random-forest approach, a set of 
34 resistance genes could be used to predict age (R 2 = 68.0%). Leveraging 
microbial host inference analyses, we inferred the age-dependent assembly of 
infant resistome was a result of shifts in the gut microbiome, primarily driven 
by changes in taxa that disproportionately harbor resistance genes across taxa 
(e.g., Escherichia coli more frequently harbored resistance genes than other 
taxa). We performed metagenomic functional profiling and metagenomic assembled 
genome analyses whose results indicate that the development of gut resistome was 
driven by changes in microbial carbohydrate metabolism, with an increasing need 
for carbohydrate-active enzymes from Bacteroidota and a decreasing need for 
Pseudomonadota during infancy. Importantly, we observed increased acquired 
resistance genes over time, which was related to increased horizontal gene 
transfer in the developing infant gut microbiome. In summary, infant age was 
negatively correlated with antimicrobial resistance gene levels, reflecting a 
composition shift in the gut microbiome, likely driven by the changing need for 
microbial carbohydrate metabolism during early life.

In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge about the environmental 
importance, relevance, and consequences of microbial arsenic (As) methylation in 
various ecosystems. In this regard, we have presented As biomethylation in 
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems particularly in rice paddy soils and 
wetlands. The functions of As biomethylation by microbial consortia in anaerobic 
and aerobic conditions are extensively discussed. In addition, we have tried to 
explain the interconnections between As transformation and carbon (C), such as 
microbial degradation of organic compounds and methane (CH4) emission. These 
processes can cause As release because of the reduction of arsenate (As(V)) to 
the more mobile arsenite (As(III)) as well as As methylation and the formation 
of toxic trivalent methylated As species in anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, 
the sulfur (S) transformation can form highly toxic thiolated As species owing 
to its interference with As biomethylation. Besides, we have focused on many 
other mutual interlinks that remain elusive between As and C, including As 
biomethylation, thiolation, and CH4 emission, in the soil-water systems. Recent 
developments have clarified the significant and complex interactions between the 
coupled microbial process in anoxic and submerged soils. These processes, 
performed by little-known/unknown microbial taxa or well-known members of 
microbial communities with unrecognized metabolic pathways, conducted several 
concurrent reactions that contributed to global warming on our planet and have 
unfavorable impacts on water quality and human food resources. Finally, some 
environmental implications in rice production and arsenic removal from 
soil-water systems are discussed. Generally, our understanding of the ecological 
and metabolic evidence for the coupling and synchronous processes of As, C, and 
S are involved in environmental contamination-caused toxicity in human food, 
including high As content in rice grain, water resources, and global warming 
through methanogenesis elucidate combating global rice safety, drinking water,

Investigating the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) 
within soil microbial communities is crucial for understanding microbial ecology 
and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. However, the study of ARGs, VFs, and 
their predominant microbial hosts in soils under varying rice production 
management practices remains largely underexplored. To this end, a three-year 
field experiment was conducted under organic management within a double rice 
cropping system in South China. The study revealed that, in contrast to 
conventional management (CK), organic farming practices did not significantly 
alter the total reads of ARGs and VFs. However, there was a notable alteration 
in the ARGs abundance at the antibiotic class level, such as an increase 
(P < 0.05) in the abundance of Multidrug ARGs (by 1.7 %) and a decrease 
(P < 0.05) in Rifamycin (by 17.5 %) and Fosfomycin ARGs (by 15.3 %). 
Furthermore, a significant shift in VFs was observed under organic farming 
compared to CK, characterized by an increase (P < 0.05) in offensive VFs and a 
decrease (P < 0.05) in nonspecific VFs and the regulation of 
virulence-associated genes. Key microbial taxa identified as influencing ARGs 
and VFs in the tested soil samples, e.g., Proteobacteria. The findings highlight 
the need for more detailed attention to soil ecology within organic rice 
production systems in South China, particularly concerning the significant 
alterations observed in ARGs and VFs.

Current microbiome signatures for chronic diseases such as diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD) are mainly based on low-resolution taxa such as genus or phyla and 
are often inconsistent among studies. In microbial ecosystems, bacterial 
functions are strain specific, and taxonomically different bacteria tend to form 
co-abundance functional groups called guilds. Here, we identified guild-level 
signatures for DKD by performing in-depth metagenomic sequencing and conducting 
genome-centric and guild-based analysis on fecal samples from 116 DKD patients 
and 91 healthy subjects. Redundancy analysis on 1,543 high-quality 
metagenome-assembled genomes (HQMAGs) identified 54 HQMAGs that were 
differentially distributed among the young healthy control group, elderly 
healthy control group, early-stage DKD patients (EDG), and late-stage DKD 
patients (LDG). Co-abundance network analysis classified the 54 HQMAGs into two 
guilds. Compared to guild 2, guild 1 contained more short-chain fatty acid 
biosynthesis genes and fewer genes encoding uremic toxin indole biosynthesis, 
antibiotic resistance, and virulence factors. Guild indices, derived from the 
total abundance of guild members and their diversity, delineated DKD patients 
from healthy subjects and between different severities of DKD. Age-adjusted 
partial Spearman correlation analysis showed that the guild indices were 
correlated with DKD disease progression and with risk indicators of poor 
prognosis. We further validated that the random forest classification model 
established with the 54 HQMAGs was also applicable for classifying patients with 
end-stage renal disease and healthy subjects in an independent data set. 
Therefore, this genome-level, guild-based microbial analysis strategy may 
identify DKD patients with different severity at an earlier stage to guide 
clinical interventions.
IMPORTANCE: Traditionally, microbiome research has been constrained by the 
reliance on taxonomic classifications that may not reflect the functional 
dynamics or the ecological interactions within microbial communities. By 
transcending these limitations with a genome-centric and guild-based analysis, 
our study sheds light on the intricate and specific interactions between 
microbial strains and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We have unveiled two 
distinct microbial guilds with opposite influences on host health, which may 
redefine our understanding of microbial contributions to disease progression. 
The implications of our findings extend beyond mere association, providing 
potential pathways for intervention and opening new avenues for patient 
stratification in clinical settings. This work paves the way for a paradigm 
shift in microbiome research in DKD and potentially other chronic kidney 
diseases, from a focus on taxonomy to a more nuanced view of microbial ecology 
and function that is more closely aligned with clinical outcomes.

Bioretention cells (BRCs) control stormwater flow on-site during precipitation, 
reducing runoff and improving water quality through chemical, physical, and 
biological processes. While BRCs are effective in these aspects, they provide 
habitats for wildlife and may face microbial hazards from fecal shedding, posing 
a potential threat to human health and the nearby environment. However, limited 
knowledge exists regarding the ability to control microbial hazards (e.g., 
beyond using typical indicator bacteria) through stormwater biofiltration. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to characterize changes in the bacterial 
community of urban stormwater undergoing bioretention treatment, with the goal 
of assessing the public health implications of these green infrastructure 
solutions. Samples from BRC inflow and outflow in Columbus, Ohio, were collected 
post-heavy storms from October 2021 to March 2022. Conventional culture-based E. 
coli monitoring and microbial source tracking (MST) were conducted to identify 
major fecal contamination extent and its sources (i.e., human, canine, avian, 
and ruminant). Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was utilized to 
quantify the level of host-associated fecal contamination in addition to three 
antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs): tetracycline resistance gene (tetQ), 
sulfonamide resistance gene (sul1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 
resistance gene (blaKPC). Subsequently, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted 
to characterize bacterial community differences between stormwater BRC inflow 
and outflow. Untreated urban stormwater reflects anthropogenic contamination, 
suggesting it as a potential source of contamination to waterbodies and urban 
environments. When comparing inlet and outlet BRC samples, urban stormwater 
treated via biofiltration did not increase microbial hazards, and changes in 
bacterial taxa and alpha diversity were negligible. Beta diversity results 
reveal a significant shift in bacterial community structure, while 
simultaneously enhancing the water quality (i.e., reduction of metals, total 
suspended solids, total nitrogen) of urban stormwater. Significant correlations 
were found between the bacterial community diversity of urban stormwater with 
fecal contamination (e.g. dog) and ARG (sul1), rainfall intensity, and water 
quality (hardness, total phosphorous). The study concludes that bioretention 
technology can sustainably maintain urban microbial water quality without posing 
additional public health risks, making it a viable green infrastructure solution 
for heavy rainfall events exacerbated by climate change.

Microcystis, a type of cyanobacteria known for producing microcystins (MCs), is 
experiencing a global increase in blooms. They have been recently recognized as 
potential contributors to the widespread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). 
By reviewing approximately 150 pieces of recent studies, a hypothesis has been 
formulated suggesting that significant fluctuations in MCs concentrations and 
microbial community structure during Microcystis blooms could influence the 
dynamics of waterborne ARGs. Among all MCs, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most 
widely distributed worldwide, notably abundant in reservoirs during summer. MCs 
inhibit protein phosphatases or increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing 
oxidative stresses, enhancing membrane permeability, and causing DNA damage. 
This further enhances selective pressures and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) 
chances of ARGs. The mechanisms by which Microcystis regulates ARG dissemination 
have been systematically organized for the first time, focusing on the secretion 
of MCs and the alterations of bacterial community structure. However, several 
knowledge gaps remain, particularly concerning how MCs interfere with the 
electron transport chain and how Microcystis facilitates HGT of ARGs. 
Concurrently, the predominance of Microcystis forming the algal microbial 
aggregates is considered a hotspot for preserving and transferring ARGs. Yet, 
Microcystis can deplete the nutrients from other taxa within these aggregates, 
thereby reducing the density of ARG-carrying bacteria. Therefore, further 
studies are needed to explore the 'symbiotic - competitive' relationships 
between Microcystis and ARG-hosting bacteria under varied nutrient conditions. 
Addressing these knowledge gaps is crucial to understand the impacts of the 
algal aggregates on dynamics of waterborne antibiotic resistome, and underscores 
the need for effective control of Microcystis to curb the spread of antibiotic 
resistance. Constructed wetlands and photocatalysis represent advantageous 
strategies for halting the spread of ARGs from the perspective of Microcystis 
blooms, as they can effectively control Microcystis and MCs while maintaining 
the stability of aquatic ecosystem.

Antibiotic resistance is a priority public health problem resulting from 
eco-evolutionary dynamics within microbial communities and their interaction at 
a mammalian host interface or geographical scale. The links between mammalian 
host genetics, bacterial gut community, and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) 
content must be better understood in natural populations inhabiting 
heterogeneous environments. Hybridization, the interbreeding of genetically 
divergent populations, influences different components of the gut microbial 
communities. However, its impact on bacterial traits such as antibiotic 
resistance is unknown. Here, we present that hybridization might shape bacterial 
communities and ARG occurrence. We used amplicon sequencing to study the gut 
microbiome and to predict ARG composition in natural populations of house mice 
(Mus musculus). We compared gastrointestinal bacterial and ARG diversity, 
composition, and abundance across a gradient of pure and hybrid genotypes in the 
European House Mouse Hybrid Zone. We observed an increased overall predicted 
richness of ARG in hybrid mice. We found bacteria-ARG interactions by their 
co-abundance and detected phenotypes of extreme abundances in hybrid mice at the 
level of specific bacterial taxa and ARGs, mainly multidrug resistance genes. 
Our work suggests that mammalian host genetic variation impacts the gut 
microbiome and chromosomal ARGs. However, it raises further questions on how the 
mammalian host genetics impact ARGs via microbiome dynamics or environmental 
covariates.

Microbial analytical methods have been instrumental in elucidating the complex 
microbial etiology of periodontal diseases, by shaping our understanding of 
subgingival community dynamics. Certain pathobionts can orchestrate the 
establishment of dysbiotic communities that can subvert the host immune system, 
triggering inflammation and tissue destruction. Yet, diagnosis and management of 
periodontal conditions still rely on clinical and radiographic examinations, 
overlooking the well-established microbial etiology. This review summarizes the 
chronological emergence of periodontal etiological models and the co-evolution 
with technological advances in microbial detection. We additionally review the 
microbial analytical approaches currently accessible to clinicians, highlighting 
their value in broadening the periodontal assessment. The epidemiological 
importance of obtaining culture-based antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 
periodontal taxa for antibiotic resistance surveillance is also underscored, 
together with clinically relevant analytical approaches to guide antibiotherapy 
choices, when necessary. Furthermore, the importance of 16S-based community and 
shotgun metagenomic profiling is discussed in outlining dysbiotic microbial 
signatures. Because dysbiosis precedes periodontal damage, biomarker 
identification offers early diagnostic possibilities to forestall disease 
relapses during maintenance. Altogether, this review highlights the 
underutilized potential of clinical microbiology in periodontology, spotlighting 
the clinical areas most conductive to its diagnostic implementation for 
enhancing prevention, treatment predictability, and addressing global antibiotic 
resistance.

Bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target plant pathogenic bacteria, have 
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional agrochemicals. However, it 
remains unclear how phages should be applied to achieve efficient pathogen 
biocontrol and to what extent their efficacy is shaped by indirect interactions 
with the resident microbiota. Here, we tested if the phage biocontrol efficacy 
of Ralstonia solanacearum phytopathogenic bacterium can be improved by 
increasing the phage cocktail application frequency and if the phage efficacy is 
affected by pathogen-suppressing bacteria already present in the rhizosphere. We 
find that increasing phage application frequency improves R. solanacearum 
density control, leading to a clear reduction in bacterial wilt disease in both 
greenhouse and field experiments with tomato. The high phage application 
frequency also increased the diversity of resident rhizosphere microbiota and 
enriched several bacterial taxa that were associated with the reduction in 
pathogen densities. Interestingly, these taxa often belonged to Actinobacteria 
known for antibiotics production and soil suppressiveness. To test if they could 
have had secondary effects on R. solanacearum biocontrol, we isolated 
Actinobacteria from Nocardia and Streptomyces genera and tested their 
suppressiveness to the pathogen in vitro and in planta. We found that these taxa 
could clearly inhibit R. solanacearum growth and constrain bacterial wilt 
disease, especially when combined with the phage cocktail. Together, our 
findings unravel an undiscovered benefit of phage therapy, where phages trigger 
a second line of defense by the pathogen-suppressing bacteria that already exist 
in resident microbial communities.
IMPORTANCE: Ralstonia solanacearum is a highly destructive plant-pathogenic 
bacterium with the ability to cause bacterial wilt in several crucial crop 
plants. Given the limitations of conventional chemical control methods, the use 
of bacterial viruses (phages) has been explored as an alternative biological 
control strategy. In this study, we show that increasing the phage application 
frequency can improve the density control of R. solanacearum, leading to a 
significant reduction in bacterial wilt disease. Furthermore, we found that 
repeated phage application increased the diversity of rhizosphere microbiota and 
specifically enriched Actinobacterial taxa that showed synergistic pathogen 
suppression when combined with phages due to resource and interference 
competition. Together, our study unravels an undiscovered benefit of phages, 
where phages trigger a second line of defense by the pathogen-suppressing 
bacteria present in resident microbial communities. Phage therapies could, 
hence, potentially be tailored according to host microbiota composition to 
unlock the pre-existing benefits provided by resident microbiota.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether the sputum bacterial microbiome differs between 
nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) patients with stable 
disease not requiring antibiotic treatment and those requiring antibiotics.
METHODS: We collected sputum samples from 21 clinically stable NTM-PD patients 
(stable group) and 14 NTM-PD patients needing antibiotic treatment (treatment 
group). We also obtained 13 follow-up samples from the stable group. We analyzed 
the 48 samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region) and compared the 
groups.
RESULTS: In the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis, the 
species Porphyromonas pasteri, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, Prevotella 
nanceiensis, and Gemella haemolysans were significantly more prevalent in the 
sputum of the stable group compared to the treatment group. No taxa showed 
significant differences in alpha-/beta-diversity or LEfSe between the 21 
baseline and 13 follow-up sputum samples in the stable group. In the stable 
group, the genus Bergeyella and species Prevotella oris were less common in 
patients who achieved spontaneous culture conversion (n = 9) compared to those 
with persistent NTM positivity (n = 12) (effect size 3.04, p = 0.039 for 
Bergeyella; effect size 3.64, p = 0.033 for P. oris). In the treatment group, H. 
parainfluenzae was more common in patients with treatment success (n = 7) than 
in treatment-refractory patients (n = 7) (effect size 4.74, p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified distinct bacterial taxa in the sputum of 
NTM-PD patients based on disease status. These results suggest the presence of a 
microbial environment that helps maintain disease stability.

The microbial composition and stress molecules are main drivers influencing the 
development and spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) and genes (ARGs) 
in the environment. A reliable and rapid method for identifying associations 
between microbiome composition and resistome remains challenging. In the present 
study, secondary metagenome data of sewage and hospital wastewaters were 
assessed for differential taxonomic and ARG profiling. Subsequently, Random 
Forest (RF)-based ML models were used to predict ARG profiles based on taxonomic 
composition and model validation on hospital wastewaters. Total ARG abundance 
was significantly higher in hospital wastewaters (15 ppm) than sewage (5 ppm), 
while the resistance towards methicillin, carbapenem, and fluoroquinolone were 
predominant. Although, Pseudomonas constituted major fraction, Streptomyces, 
Enterobacter, and Klebsiella were characteristic of hospital wastewaters. 
Prediction modeling showed that the relative abundance of pathogenic genera 
Escherichia, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas contributed most towards variations in 
total ARG count. Moreover, the model was able to identify host-specific patterns 
for contributing taxa and related ARGs with >90% accuracy in predicting the ARG 
subtype abundance. More than >80% accuracy was obtained for hospital 
wastewaters, demonstrating that the model can be validly extrapolated to 
different types of wastewater systems. Findings from the study showed that the 
ML approach could identify ARG profile based on bacterial composition including 
16S rDNA amplicon data, and can serve as a viable alternative to metagenomic 
binning for identification of potential hosts of ARGs. Overall, this study 
demonstrates the promising application of ML techniques for predicting the 
spread of ARGs and provides guidance for early warning of ARBs emergence.

Microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are two types of 
contaminants that are widely present in the soil environment. MPs can act as 
carriers of microbes, facilitating the colonization and spread of ARGs and thus 
posing potential hazards to ecosystem safety and human health. In the present 
study, we explored the microbial networks and ARG distribution characteristics 
in different soil types (heavy metal (HM)-contaminated soil and agricultural 
soil planted with different plants: Bidens pilosa L., Ipomoea aquatica F., and 
Brassica chinensis L.) after the application of MPs and evaluated environmental 
factors, potential microbial hosts, and ARGs. The microbial communities in the 
three rhizosphere soils were closely related to each other, and the modularity 
of the microbial networks was greater than 0.4. Moreover, the core taxa in the 
microbial networks, including Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Myxococcota, 
were important for resisting environmental stress. The ARG resistance mechanisms 
were dominated by antibiotic efflux in all three rhizosphere soils. Based on the 
annotation results, the MP treatments induced changes in the relative abundance 
of microbes carrying ARGs, and the G1-5 treatment significantly increased the 
abundance of MuxB in Verrucomicrobia, Elusimicrobia, Actinobacteria, 
Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria. Path analysis showed that changes in MP 
particle size and dosage may indirectly affect soil enzyme activities by 
changing pH, which affects microbes and ARGs. We suggest that MPs may provide 
surfaces for ARG accumulation, leading to ARG enrichment in plants. In 
conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPs, as potentially persistent 
pollutants, can affect different types of soil environments and that the 
presence of ARGs may cause substantial environmental risks.

BACKGROUND: The role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis 
(UC) has been increasingly recognized. However, most of the reports are from 
Western populations. In Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, little 
is known about the role of microbiota. Therefore, our aim was to describe the 
bacterial microbiota profile and signature in pediatric UC in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: Twenty children with UC and 20 healthy controls enrolled in the study 
gave stool samples. Twenty rectal mucosal samples were taken from UC and 20 from 
non-UC controls. Inclusion criteria included newly diagnosed and untreated 
children and lack of antibiotic exposure for at least 6 months before stool 
collection was required for children with UC and controls. Bacterial 
deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted and sequenced using shotgun metagenomic 
analysis. Statistical analysis included Shannon alpha diversity metrics, 
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, DESeq2, and biomarker discovery.
RESULTS: The demographic characteristics were similar in children with UC and 
controls. There was a significant reduction in alpha diversity (P = 0.037) and 
beta diversity in samples from children with UC (P = 0.001). Many taxa were 
identified with log2 abundance analysis, revealing 110 and 102 species 
significantly depleted and enriched in UC, respectively. Eleven bacterial 
species' signatures were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: In Saudi Arabian children with UC, we demonstrate a dysbiosis 
similar to reports from Western populations, possibly related to changes of 
lifestyle. Microbial signature discovery in this report is an important 
contribution to research, leading to the development of adjunctive non-invasive 
diagnostic options in unusual cases of UC.

Antibiotic resistance is increasingly recognized as a critical challenge 
affecting human, animal, and environmental health. Yet, environmental dynamics 
and transport of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities in 
karst and non-karst leachate following poultry litter land applications are not 
well understood. This study investigates impacts of broiler poultry litter 
application on the proliferation of ARGs (tetW, qnrS, ermB, sulI, and 
blaCTX-M-32), class 1 integron (intI1 i), and alterations in microbial 
communities (16S rRNA) within karst derived soils, which are crucial and 
under-researched systems in the global hydrological cycle, and non-karst 
landscapes. Using large, intact soil columns (45 cm diam. × 100 cm depth) from 
karst and non-karst landscapes, the role of preferential flow and ARG transport 
in leachate was enumerated following surface application of poultry litter and 
simulated rain events. This research demonstrated that in poultry litter amended 
karst soils, ARG (i.e., ermB and tetW) abundance in leachate increased 1.5 times 
compared to non-karst systems (p < 0.05), highlighting the influence of 
geological factors on ARG proliferation. Notably, microbial communities in karst 
soil leachate exhibited increased diversity and abundance, suggesting a 
potential linkage between microbial composition and ARG presence. Further, our 
correlation and network analyses identified relationships between leachate ARGs, 
microbial taxa, and physicochemical properties, underscoring the complex 
interplay in these environmentally sensitive areas. These findings illuminate 
the critical role of karst systems in shaping ARG abundance and pollutant 
dispersal and microbial community dynamics, thus emphasizing the need for 
landscape-specific approaches in managing ARG dissemination to the environment. 
This study provides a deeper understanding of hydrogeological ARG dynamics but 
also lays the groundwork for future research and strategies to mitigate ARG 
dissemination through targeted manure applications across agricultural 
landscapes.

The plastisphere, a unique microbial biofilm community colonizing plastic debris 
and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments, has attracted increasing 
attention owing to its ecological and public health implications. This review 
consolidates current state of knowledge on freshwater plastisphere, focussing on 
its biodiversity, community assembly, and interactions with environmental 
factors. Current biomolecular approaches revealed a variety of prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic taxa associated with plastic surfaces. Despite their ecological 
importance, the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and mobile genetic 
elements (i.e., antibiotic resistance genes) raises concerns for ecosystem and 
human health. However, the extent of these risks and their implications remain 
unclear. Advanced sequencing technologies are promising for elucidating the 
functions of plastisphere, particularly in plastic biodegradation processes. 
Overall, this review emphasizes the need for comprehensive studies to understand 
plastisphere dynamics in freshwater and to support effective management 
strategies to mitigate the impact of plastic pollution on freshwater resources.

BACKGROUND: Immune regulation by gut microbiota is affected by dysbiosis and may 
precede food allergy onset. Prior studies lacked comparisons stratified by age 
and clinical phenotype.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiome of children with food allergy (<3 years, 
3-18 years) compared with similar aged children without food allergy.
METHODS: A real-world prospective cross-sectional study performed from 2014 to 
2019 recruited children highly likely to have milk, egg, or peanut allergy 
defined by history and serum IgE or confirmed by food challenge. 16S ribosomal 
RNA sequencing identified stool microbial DNA. Alpha and beta diversity was 
compared between groups with food allergy and healthy controls stratified by 
age. Differential abundance for non a priori taxa was accepted at absolute 
fold-change greater than 2 and q value less than 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were included (56 with food allergy and 14 
healthy controls). Groups were not significantly different in age, gender at 
birth, race, mode of delivery, breastfeeding duration, or antibiotic exposure. 
Younger children with food allergy had similar alpha diversity compared with 
controls. Beta diversity was significantly different by age (P = .001). There 
was differential abundance of several a priori (P < .05) taxa (including 
Clostridia) only in younger children. Both a priori (including Coprococcus and 
Clostridia) and non a priori (q < 0.05) Acidobacteria_Gp15, Aestuariispira, 
Tindallia, and Desulfitispora were significant in older children with food 
allergy, especially with peanut allergy.
CONCLUSION: Dysbiosis associates with food allergy, most prominent in older 
children with peanut allergy. Younger children with and without food allergy 
have fewer differences in gut microbiota. This correlates with clinical 
observations of persistence of peanut allergy and improved efficacy and safety 
of oral immunotherapy in younger children. Age younger than 3 years should be 
considered when initiating therapeutic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the microbiome of dental 
plaque in individuals with varying periodontal statuses, encompassing both 
periodontal health and disease. The primary objectives were to identify 
microbial markers associated with different clinical conditions, explore 
variations in microbial diversity, and investigate potential correlations 
between the oral microbiome and clinical parameters.
METHODS: A cross-sectional design was employed, involving 164 participants aged 
18 to 65 years. Inclusion criteria comprised individuals with good oral and 
systemic health for the periodontal health group and those diagnosed with 
various stages of periodontal disease for the periodontal disease group. Dental 
plaque samples were meticulously collected from diverse tooth surfaces, and 
clinical examinations were conducted to assess periodontal health status. 
High-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was utilized for 
microbiome analysis.
RESULTS: Demographic characteristics revealed a balanced distribution between 
the periodontal health and disease groups. Clinical parameters, including 
probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing, exhibited 
significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001). Microbial diversity 
indices indicated a higher diversity in the periodontal health group compared to 
the disease group (p < 0.001). Analysis of relative abundance of bacterial phyla 
identified significant variations, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and 
Actinobacteria showing differential prevalence between health and disease (p < 
0.05). Differentially abundant taxa analysis highlighted specific species 
associated with each clinical condition, including Prevotella intermedia and 
Porphyromonas gingivalis. Network analysis revealed complex microbial 
interactions within the oral microbiome. Functional predictions indicated 
variations in metabolic capabilities between health and disease, with potential 
implications for virulence and antibiotic resistance.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the oral microbiome 
in periodontal health and disease, revealing significant associations between 
microbial composition and clinical parameters. The identification of microbial 
markers and functional insights enhances our understanding of the complex 
interplay within the oral ecosystem. These findings hold promise for advancing 
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches tailored to individual microbial profiles.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is responsible for around 300,000 
hospitalizations yearly in the United States, with the associated monetary cost 
being billions of dollars. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is known to be important to 
CDI. To the best of our knowledge, metatranscriptomics (MT) has only been used 
to characterize gut microbiome composition and function in one prior study 
involving CDI patients. Therefore, we utilized MT to investigate differences in 
active community diversity and composition between CDI+ (n = 20) and CDI- 
(n = 19) samples with respect to microbial taxa and expressed genes. No 
significant (Kruskal-Wallis, p > 0.05) differences were detected for richness or 
evenness based on CDI status. However, clustering based on CDI status was 
significant for both active microbial taxa and expressed genes datasets 
(PERMANOVA, p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, differential feature analysis revealed 
greater expression of the opportunistic pathogens Enterocloster bolteae and 
Ruminococcus gnavus in CDI+ compared to CDI- samples. When only fungal sequences 
were considered, the family Saccharomycetaceae expressed more genes in CDI-, 
while 31 other fungal taxa were identified as significantly (Kruskal-Wallis 
p ≤ 0.05, log(LDA) ≥ 2) associated with CDI+. We also detected a variety of 
genes and pathways that differed significantly (Kruskal-Wallis p ≤ 0.05, 
log(LDA) ≥ 2) based on CDI status. Notably, differential genes associated with 
biofilm formation were expressed by C. difficile. This provides evidence of 
another possible contributor to C. difficile's resistance to antibiotics and 
frequent recurrence in vivo. Furthermore, the greater number of CDI+ associated 
fungal taxa constitute additional evidence that the mycobiome is important to 
CDI pathogenesis. Future work will focus on establishing if C. difficile is 
actively producing biofilms during infection and if any specific fungal taxa are 
particularly influential in CDI.

BACKGROUND: Artisanal cheeses usually contain a highly diverse microbial 
community which can significantly impact their quality and safety. Here, we 
describe a detailed longitudinal study assessing the impact of ripening in three 
natural caves on the microbiome and resistome succession across three different 
producers of Cabrales blue-veined cheese.
RESULTS: Both the producer and cave in which cheeses were ripened significantly 
influenced the cheese microbiome. Lactococcus and the former Lactobacillus 
genus, among other taxa, showed high abundance in cheeses at initial stages of 
ripening, either coming from the raw material, starter culture used, and/or the 
environment of processing plants. Along cheese ripening in caves, these taxa 
were displaced by other bacteria, such as Tetragenococcus, Corynebacterium, 
Brevibacterium, Yaniella, and Staphylococcus, predominantly originating from 
cave environments (mainly food contact surfaces), as demonstrated by 
source-tracking analysis, strain analysis at read level, and the 
characterization of 613 metagenome-assembled genomes. The high abundance of 
Tetragenococcus koreensis and Tetragenococcus halophilus detected in cheese has 
not been found previously in cheese metagenomes. Furthermore, Tetragenococcus 
showed a high level of horizontal gene transfer with other members of the cheese 
microbiome, mainly with Lactococcus and Staphylococcus, involving genes related 
to carbohydrate metabolism functions. The resistome analysis revealed that raw 
milk and the associated processing environments are a rich reservoir of 
antimicrobial resistance determinants, mainly associated with resistance to 
aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and β-lactam antibiotics and harbored by aerobic 
gram-negative bacteria of high relevance from a safety point of view, such as 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
and that the displacement of most raw milk-associated taxa by cave-associated 
taxa during ripening gave rise to a significant decrease in the load of ARGs 
and, therefore, to a safer end product.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the cave environments represented an important source of 
non-starter microorganisms which may play a relevant role in the quality and 
safety of the end products. Among them, we have identified novel taxa and taxa 
not previously regarded as being dominant components of the cheese microbiome 
(Tetragenococcus spp.), providing very valuable information for the 
authentication of this protected designation of origin artisanal cheese. Video

A novel 4-thiazolidinone derivative Les-6490 (pyrazol-4-thiazolidinone hybrid) 
was designed, synthesized, and characterized by spectral data. The compound was 
screened for its antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria and 
fungi and showed activity against Staphylococcus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
(the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 820 μM). The compound was studied in 
the rat adjuvant arthritis model (Freund's Adjuvant) in vivo. Parietal and fecal 
microbial composition using 16S rRNA metagenome sequences was checked. We 
employed a range of analytical techniques, including Taxonomic Profiling (Taxa 
Analysis), Diversity Metrics (Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis), Multivariate 
Statistical Methods (Principal Coordinates Analysis, Principal Component 
Analysis, Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling), Clustering Analysis (Unweighted 
Pair-group Method with Arithmetic Mean), and Comparative Statistical Approaches 
(Community Differences Analysis, Between Group Variation Analysis, Metastat 
Analysis). The compound significantly impacted an increasing level of 
anti-inflammatory microorganisms (Blautia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
Succivibrionaceae, and Coriobacteriales) relative recovery of fecal microbiota 
composition. Anti-Treponemal activity in vivo was also noted. The tested 
compound Les-6490 has potential prebiotic activity with an indirect 
anti-inflammatory effect.

Household-related microbiome is closely related with human health. However, the 
knowledge about profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence 
factor genes (VFGs) which are carried by microbes inside homes and their 
temporal dynamics are rather limited. Here we monitored the seasonal changes of 
bacterial community (especially pathogenic bacteria), ARGs, and VFGs in 
household dust samples during two years. Based on metagenomic sequencing, the 
dust-related bacterial pathogenic community, ARGs, and VFGs all harbored the 
lowest richness in spring among four seasons. Their structure (except that of 
VFGs) also exhibited remarkable differences among the seasons. The structural 
variations of ARGs and VFGs were almost explained by mobile genetic elements 
(MGEs), bacterial pathogens, and particulate matter-related factors, with MGEs 
explaining the most. Moreover, the total normalized abundance of ARGs or VFGs 
showed no significant change across the seasons. Results of metagenomic binning 
and microbial network both showed that several pathogenic taxa (e.g., Ralstonia 
pickettii) were strongly linked with numerous ARGs (mainly resistant to 
multidrug) and VFGs (mainly encoding motility) simultaneously. Overall, these 
findings underline the significance of MGEs in structuring ARGs and VFGs inside 
homes along with seasonal variations, suggesting that household dust is a 
neglected reservoir for ARGs and VFGs.

BACKGROUND: Ascomycetous budding yeasts are ubiquitous environmental 
microorganisms important in food production and medicine. Due to recent 
intensive genomic research, the taxonomy of yeast is becoming more organized 
based on the identification of monophyletic taxa. This includes genera important 
to humans, such as Kazachstania. Until now, Kazachstania humilis (previously 
Candida humilis) was regarded as a sourdough-specific yeast. In addition, any 
antibacterial activity has not been associated with this species.
RESULTS: Previously, we isolated a yeast strain that impaired bio-hydrogen 
production in a dark fermentation bioreactor and inhibited the growth of 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here, using next generation sequencing 
technologies, we sequenced the genome of this strain named K. humilis MAW1. This 
is the first genome of a K. humilis isolate not originating from a fermented 
food. We used novel phylogenetic approach employing the 18 S-ITS-D1-D2 region to 
show the placement of the K. humilis MAW1 among other members of the 
Kazachstania genus. This strain was examined by global phenotypic profiling, 
including carbon sources utilized and the influence of stress conditions on 
growth. Using the well-recognized bacterial model Escherichia coli AB1157, we 
show that K. humilis MAW1 cultivated in an acidic medium inhibits bacterial 
growth by the disturbance of cell division, manifested by filament formation. To 
gain a greater understanding of the inhibitory effect of K. humilis MAW1, we 
selected 23 yeast proteins with recognized toxic activity against bacteria and 
used them for Blast searches of the K. humilis MAW1 genome assembly. The 
resulting panel of genes present in the K. humilis MAW1 genome included those 
encoding the 1,3-β-glucan glycosidase and the 1,3-β-glucan synthesis inhibitor 
that might disturb the bacterial cell envelope structures.
CONCLUSIONS: We characterized a non-sourdough-derived strain of K. humilis, 
including its genome sequence and physiological aspects. The MAW1, together with 
other K. humilis strains, shows the new organization of the mating-type locus. 
The revealed here pH-dependent ability to inhibit bacterial growth has not been 
previously recognized in this species. Our study contributes to the building of 
genome sequence-based classification systems; better understanding of K.humilis 
as a cell factory in fermentation processes and exploring bacteria-yeast 
interactions in microbial communities.

The role of the microbiome in immunotherapy has recently garnered substantial 
attention, with molecular studies and clinical trials providing emerging 
evidence on the pivotal influence of the microbiota in enhancing therapeutic 
outcomes via immune response modulation. However, the impact of microbial 
communities can considerably vary across individuals and different 
immunotherapeutic approaches, posing prominent challenges in harnessing their 
potential. In this comprehensive review, we outline the current research 
applications in tumor immunotherapy and delve into the possible mechanisms 
through which immune function is influenced by microbial communities in various 
body sites, encompassing those in the gut, extraintestinal barrier, and 
intratumoral environment. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of diverse 
microbiome-based strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota 
transplantation, and the targeted modulation of specific microbial taxa, and 
antibiotic treatments on cancer immunotherapy. All these strategies potentially 
have a profound impact on immunotherapy and pave the way for personalized 
therapeutic approaches and predictive biomarkers.

Introduction: To consider the growing health issues caused by antibiotic 
resistance from a "one health" perspective, the contribution of meat production 
needs to be addressed. While antibiotic resistance is naturally present in 
microbial communities, the treatment of farm animals with antibiotics causes an 
increase in antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the gut microbiome. Pigs are 
among the most prevalent animals in agriculture; therefore, reducing the 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the pig gut microbiome could 
reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. Probiotics are often studied as a 
way to modulate the microbiome and are, therefore, an interesting way to 
potentially decrease antibiotic resistance. Methods: To assess the efficacy of a 
probiotic to reduce the prevalence of ARGs in the pig microbiome, six pigs 
received either treatment with antibiotics (tylvalosin), probiotics (Pediococcus 
acidilactici MA18/5M; Biopower® PA), or a combination of both. Their faeces and 
ileal digesta were collected and DNA was extracted for whole genome shotgun 
sequencing. The reads were compared with taxonomy and ARG databases to identify 
the taxa and resistance genes in the samples. Results: The results showed that 
the ARG profiles in the faeces of the antibiotic and combination treatments were 
similar, and both were different from the profiles of the probiotic treatment (p 
< 0.05). The effects of the treatments were different in the digesta and faeces. 
Many macrolide resistance genes were detected in a higher proportion in the 
microbiome of the pigs treated with antibiotics or the combination of probiotics 
and antibiotics. Resistance-carrying conjugative plasmids and horizontal 
transfer genes were also amplified in faeces samples for the antibiotic and 
combined treatments. There was no effect of treatment on the short chain fatty 
acid content in the digesta or the faeces. Conclusion: There is no positive 
effect of adding probiotics to an antibiotic treatment when these treatments are 
administered simultaneously.

Antimicrobial resistance is considered to be one of the biggest public health 
problems, and airborne transmission is an important but under-appreciated 
pathway for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. 
Previous research has shown pharmaceutical factories to be a major source of 
ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the surrounding receiving water 
and soil environments. Pharmaceutical factories are hotspots of antibiotic 
resistance, but the atmospheric transmission and its environmental risk remain 
more concerns. Here, we conducted a metagenomic investigation into the airborne 
microbiome and resistome in three pharmaceutical factories in China. Soil 
(average: 38.45%) and wastewater (average: 28.53%) were major contributors of 
airborne resistome. ARGs (vanR/vanS, blaOXA, and CfxA) conferring resistance to 
critically important clinically used antibiotics were identified in the air 
samples. The wastewater treatment area had significantly higher relative 
abundances of ARGs (average: 0.64 copies/16S rRNA). Approximately 28.2% of the 
detected airborne ARGs were found to be associated with plasmids, and this 
increased to about 50% in the wastewater treatment area. We have compiled a list 
of high-risk airborne ARGs found in pharmaceutical factories. Moreover, A total 
of 1,043 viral operational taxonomic units were identified and linked to 47 
family-group taxa. Different CRISPR-Cas immune systems have been identified in 
bacterial hosts in response to phage infection. Similarly, higher phage 
abundance (average: 2451.70 PPM) was found in the air of the wastewater 
treatment area. Our data provide insights into the antibiotic resistance gene 
profiles and microbiome (bacterial and non-bacterial) in pharmaceutical 
factories and reveal the potential role of horizontal transfer in the spread of 
airborne ARGs, with implications for human and animal health.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common late-onset infections 
in preterm infants, characterized by nonspecific symptoms and a pathogenic 
spectrum that diverges from that of term infants and older children, which 
present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Existing data on the role 
of gut microbiota in UTI pathogenesis in this demographic are limited. This 
study aims to investigate alterations in gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin 
levels and their association with the development of UTIs in hospitalized 
preterm infants. A longitudinal case-control study was conducted involving 
preterm infants admitted between January 2018 and October 2020. Fecal samples 
were collected weekly and analyzed for microbial profiles and calprotectin 
levels. Propensity score matching, accounting for key perinatal factors 
including age and antibiotic use, was utilized to match samples from 
UTI-diagnosed infants to those from non-UTI counterparts. Among the 151 preterm 
infants studied, 53 were diagnosed with a UTI, predominantly caused by 
Enterobacteriaceae (79.3%) and Enterococcaceae (19.0%). Infants with UTIs showed 
a significantly higher abundance of these families compared to non-UTI infants, 
for both Gram-negative and positive pathogens, respectively. Notably, there was 
a significant pre-UTI increase in the abundance of pathogen-specific taxa in 
infants later diagnosed with UTIs, offering high predictive value for early 
detection. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing further confirmed the dominance of 
specific pathogenic species pre-UTI and revealed altered virulence factor 
profiles associated with Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli infections. 
Additionally, a decline in fecal calprotectin levels was observed preceding UTI 
onset, particularly in cases involving Enterobacteriaceae. The observed 
pathogen-specific alterations in the gut microbiota preceding UTI onset offer 
novel insight into the UTI pathogenesis and promising early biomarkers for UTIs 
in preterm infants, potentially enhancing the timely management of this common 
infection. However, further validation in larger cohorts is essential to confirm 
these findings.

Slough is a well-known feature of non-healing wounds. This pilot study aims to 
determine the proteomic and microbiologic components of slough as well as 
interrogate the associations between wound slough components and wound healing. 
Ten subjects with slow-to-heal wounds and visible slough were enrolled. 
Aetiologies included venous stasis ulcers, post-surgical site infections and 
pressure ulcers. Patient co-morbidities and wound healing outcome at 3-months 
post-sample collection was recorded. Debrided slough was analysed 
microscopically, through untargeted proteomics, and high-throughput bacterial 
16S-ribosomal gene sequencing. Microscopic imaging revealed wound slough to be 
amorphous in structure and highly variable. 16S-profiling found slough microbial 
communities to associate with wound aetiology and location on the body. Across 
all subjects, slough largely consisted of proteins involved in skin structure 
and formation, blood-clot formation and immune processes. To predict variables 
associated with wound healing, protein, microbial and clinical datasets were 
integrated into a supervised discriminant analysis. This analysis revealed that 
healing wounds were enriched for proteins involved in skin barrier development 
and negative regulation of immune responses. While wounds that deteriorated over 
time started off with a higher baseline Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Score and 
were enriched for anaerobic bacterial taxa and chronic inflammatory proteins. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate clinical, microbiome, and 
proteomic data to systematically characterise wound slough and integrate it into 
a single assessment to predict wound healing outcome. Collectively, our findings 
underscore how slough components can help identify wounds at risk of continued 
impaired healing and serves as an underutilised biomarker.

Host-associated microbiota are critical for eukaryotic host functioning, to the 
extent that hosts and their associated microbial communities are often 
considered "holobionts". Most studies of holobionts have focused on descriptive 
approaches or have used model systems, usually in the laboratory, to understand 
host-microbiome interactions. To advance our understanding of host-microbiota 
interactions and their wider ecological impacts, we need experimental frameworks 
that can explore causation in non-model hosts, which often have highly diverse 
microbiota, and in their natural ecological setting (i.e. in the field). We used 
a dominant habitat-forming seaweed, Hormosira banksii, to explore these issues 
and to experimentally test host-microbiota interactions in a non-model 
holobiont. The experimental protocols were aimed at trying to disentangle 
microbially mediated effects on hosts from direct effects on hosts associated 
with the methods employed to manipulate host-microbiota. This was done by 
disrupting the microbiome, either through removal/disruption using a combination 
of antimicrobial treatments, or additions of specific taxa via inoculations, or 
a combination of thew two. The experiments were done in mesocosms and in the 
field. Three different antibiotic treatments were used to disrupt 
seaweed-associated microbiota to test whether disturbances of microbiota, 
particularly bacteria, would negatively affect host performance. Responses of 
bacteria to these disturbances were complex and differed substantially among 
treatments, with some antibacterial treatments having little discernible effect. 
However, the temporal sequence of responses antibiotic treatments, changes in 
bacterial diversity and subsequent decreases in host performance, strongly 
suggested an effect of the microbiota on host performance in some treatments, as 
opposed to direct effects of the antibiotics. To further test these effects, we 
used 16S-rRNA-gene sequencing to identify bacterial taxa that were either 
correlated, or uncorrelated, with poor host performance following antibiotic 
treatment. These were then isolated and used in inoculation experiments, 
independently or in combination with the previously used antibiotic treatments. 
Negative effects on host performance were strongest where specific microbial 
antimicrobials treatments were combined with inoculations of strains that were 
correlated with poor host performance. For these treatments, negative host 
effects persisted the entire experimental period (12 days), even though 
treatments were only applied at the beginning of the experiment. Host 
performance recovered in all other treatments. These experiments provide a 
framework for exploring causation and disentangling microbially mediated vs. 
direct effects on hosts for ecologically important, non-model holobionts in the 
field. This should allow for better predictions of how these systems will 
respond to, and potentially mitigate, environmental disturbances in their 
natural context.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal dysbacteriosis has frequently been involved in the 
context of depression. Nonetheless, only scant information is available about 
the features and functional changes of gut microbiota in female middle-aged 
depression (MAD).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore whether there are characteristic changes 
in the gut microbes of female MAD and whether these changes are associated with 
depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, this study observed alterations in the 
lipid metabolism function of gut microbes and further examined changes in plasma 
medium- and long-chain fatty acids (MLCFAs) in mice that underwent fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT).
METHODS: Stool samples obtained from 31 MAD, along with 24 healthy individuals 
(HC) were analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Meanwhile, 14-month-old female 
C57BL/6J mice received antibiotic cocktails and then oral gavage of the 
microbiota suspension of MAD or HC for 3 weeks to reconstruct gut microbiota. 
The subsequent depressive-like behaviors, the composition of gut microbiota, as 
well as MLCFAs in the plasma were evaluated.
RESULTS: A noteworthy disruption in gut microbial composition in MAD individuals 
compared to HC was observed. Several distinct bacterial taxa, including Dorea, 
Butyricicoccus, and Blautia, demonstrated associations with the demographic 
variables. A particular microbial panel encompassing 49 genera effectively 
differentiated MAD patients from HC (AUC = 0.82). Fecal microbiome 
transplantation from MAD subjects led to depressive-like behaviors and 
dysfunction of plasma MLCFAs in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that microbial dysbiosis is linked to the 
pathogenesis of MAD, and its role may be associated with the regulation of 
MLCFAs metabolism.

INTRODUCTION: Ingestion of human milk (HM) is identified as a significant factor 
associated with early infant gut microbial colonization, which has been 
associated with infant health and development. Maternal diet has been associated 
with the HM microbiome (HMM). However, a few studies have explored the 
associations among maternal diet, HMM, and infant growth during the first 
6 months of lactation.
METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, Mam-Mayan mother-infant dyads (n = 64) 
were recruited from 8 rural communities in the Western Highlands of Guatemala at 
two stages of lactation: early (6-46 days postpartum, n = 29) or late 
(109-184 days postpartum, n = 35). Recruited mothers had vaginally delivered 
singleton births, had no subclinical mastitis or antibiotic treatments, and 
breastfed their infants. Data collected at both stages of lactation included two 
24-h recalls, milk samples, and infant growth status indicators: 
head-circumference-for-age-z-score (HCAZ), length-for-age-z-score (LAZ), and 
weight-for-age-z-score (WAZ). Infants were divided into subgroups: normal weight 
(WAZ ≥ -1SD) and mildly underweight (WAZ < -1SD), non-stunted (LAZ ≥ -1.5SD) and 
mildly stunted (LAZ < -1.5SD), and normal head-circumference (HCAZ ≥ -1SD) and 
smaller head-circumference (HCAZ < -1SD). HMM was identified using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing; amplicon analysis was performed with the high-resolution ANCHOR 
pipeline, and DESeq2 identified the differentially abundant (DA) HMM at the 
species-level between infant growth groups (FDR < 0.05) in both early and late 
lactation.
RESULTS: Using both cluster and univariate analyses, we identified (a) positive 
correlations between infant growth clusters and maternal dietary clusters, (b) 
both positive and negative associations among maternal macronutrient and 
micronutrient intakes with the HMM at the species level and (c) distinct 
correlations between HMM DA taxa with maternal nutrient intakes and infant 
z-scores that differed between breast-fed infants experiencing growth faltering 
and normal growth in early and late lactation.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings provide important evidence of the 
potential influence of maternal diet on the early-life growth of breastfed 
infants via modulation of the HMM.

Urban streams that receive untreated domestic and hospital waste can transmit 
infectious diseases and spread drug residues, including antimicrobials, which 
can then increase the selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Here, water 
samples were collected from three different urban streams in the state of São 
Paulo, Brazil, to relate their range of Water Quality Indices (WQIs) to the 
diversity and composition of aquatic microbial taxa, virulence genes (virulome), 
and antimicrobial resistance determinants (resistome), all assessed using 
untargeted metagenome sequencing. There was a predominance of phyla 
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in all samples, and 
Pseudomonas was the most abundant detected genus. Virulence genes associated 
with motility, adherence, and secretion systems were highly abundant and mainly 
associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, some opportunistic 
pathogenic genera had negative correlations with WQI. Many clinically relevant 
antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and efflux pump-encoding genes that confer 
resistance to critically important antimicrobials were detected. The highest 
relative abundances of ARGs were β-lactams and 
macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin. No statistically supported relationship was 
detected between the abundance of virulome/resistome and collection type/WQI. On 
the other hand, total solids were a weak predictor of gene abundance patterns. 
These results provide insights into various microbial outcomes given urban 
stream quality and point to its ecological complexity. In addition, this study 
suggests potential consequences for human health as mediated by aquatic 
microbial communities responding to typical urban outputs.

BACKGROUND: Acute gastro-intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI-GVHD) and 
non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic HCT are closely related to loss of 
microbial diversity and intestinal dominance by single taxa resulting from the 
use of antibiotics, dietary changes, and mucosal barrier injury. There is a 
paucity of data on the impact of use of antibiotics in HCT after Flu-TBI-based 
non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning where there is absence of mucositis and 
limited malnutrition.
METHODS: We did a retrospective single-center analysis of patients receiving 
Flu-TBI-based NMA HCT for a high-grade myeloid malignancy, mostly AML, and MDS, 
or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed the impact of pre-engraftment 
antibiotic exposure, prophylactic ciprofloxacin, and or treatment with 
broad-spectrum cephalosporin/carbapenem, on HCT outcomes, with a focus on the 
incidence of acute GI-GVHD by day 180 and NRM at 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were evaluable with a median age of 62 years. 
Antibiotics were used in 90 patients; 60 prophylactic use only and 30 
therapeutic use with or without previous prophylaxis. Antibiotic use resulted in 
a significant higher incidence of GI-GVHD Stage 1-4; 29% (26/90) versus 5% 
(3/60) in those not receiving antibiotics (OR 8.1 (95% CI 2.3-28.3), p = 0.001). 
Use of antibiotics resulted in higher 1-year NRM (19% (17/90) versus 10% (6/60), 
HR 2.3, p = 0.06), and decreased 2-year GRFS (42% (38/90) versus 55% (33/60), HR 
1.7, p = 0.04), but did not impact RFS or OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of antibiotics was related to the occurrence of GI-GVHD, NRM, 
and GRFS in patients receiving truly NMA HCT. Therefore, in the absence of 
mucositis and low incidence of bacteremia, antibiotics can and should be used 
restrictively in this setting.

This study aimed to dissect the relationship between specific gut commensal 
bacterial subgroups, their functional metabolic pathways, and their impact on 
skin allograft outcome and alloimmunity. We previously showed that oral 
broad-spectrum antibiotic (Abx) pretreatment in mice delayed skin, heart, and 
lung allograft rejection and dampened alloimmune responses. Here, rationally 
designed Abx combinations targeting major bacterial groups were used to 
elucidate their individual contribution to modulating alloimmune responses. Abx 
cocktails targeting intestinal gram-negative, gram-positive, or 
anaerobic/gram-positive bacteria by oral gavage, all delayed skin allograft 
rejection, and reduced alloreactive T cell priming to different extents. 
Notably, the most pronounced extension of skin allograft survival and 
attenuation of alloimmunity were achieved when all gut bacterial groups were 
simultaneously targeted. These results suggest a model in which the strength of 
the alloimmune response is additively tuned up by gut microbial diversity. 
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing enabled strain-level resolution and identified a 
shared commensal, Parabacteroides distasonis, as the most enriched following all 
Abx treatments. Oral administration of P.distasonis to mice harboring a diverse 
microbiota significantly prolonged skin allograft survival, identifying a 
probiotic with therapeutic benefit in transplantation.

Gut microbiota plays a functional role in nutrition among several insects. 
However, the situation is unclear in Lepidoptera. Field studies suggest the 
microbiome may not be stable and is determined by diet, while in the laboratory, 
Lepidoptera are routinely reared on diet containing antibiotics with unknown 
effects on microbial communities. Furthermore, molecular approaches for the 
characterization of lepidopteran microbiomes rarely describe the metabolically 
active gut bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate how diet and 
antibiotics affect Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) growth and the diversity and 
activity of the gut bacteria community. We assessed how alfalfa and wheat 
germ-based diets affected larval growth, in the presence and absence of 
streptomycin. Alfalfa diet improved larval growth, pupal mass, and survival, but 
antibiotic was only beneficial in the wheat germ diet. We observed diet-driven 
changes in the gut bacterial communities. In the active community, the alfalfa 
colony was dominated by Enterococcus and Rhodococcus whereas in the wheat germ 
colony, only Enterococcus was present. In contrast, spore-forming Bacilli 
species were very common members of the DNA community. In both cases, 
streptomycin had a selective effect on the relative abundance of the taxa 
present. Our study highlights the importance of characterizing both the 
diversity and activity of the gut microbiota community. DNA-derived communities 
may include environmental DNA, spores, or non-viable bacteria, while RNA-derived 
communities are more likely to give an accurate representation of the diversity 
of active members that are potentially directly involved in the metabolic 
processes of the host.

Promoting soil suppressiveness against soil borne pathogens could be a promising 
strategy to manage crop diseases. One way to increase the suppression potential 
in agricultural soils is via the addition of organic amendments. This 
microbe-mediated phenomenon, although not fully understood, prompted our study 
to explore the microbial taxa and functional properties associated with 
Rhizoctonia solani disease suppression in sugar beet seedlings after amending 
soil with a keratin-rich waste stream. Soil samples were analyzed using shotgun 
metagenomics sequencing. Results showed that both amended soils were enriched in 
bacterial families found in disease suppressive soils before, indicating that 
the amendment of keratin-rich material can support the transformation into a 
suppressive soil. On a functional level, genes encoding keratinolytic enzymes 
were found to be abundant in the keratin-amended samples. Proteins enriched in 
amended soils were those potentially involved in the production of secondary 
metabolites/antibiotics, motility, keratin-degradation, and contractile 
secretion system proteins. We hypothesize these taxa contribute to the 
amendment-induced suppression effect due to their genomic potential to produce 
antibiotics, secrete effectors via the contractile secretion system, and degrade 
oxalate-a potential virulence factor of R. solani-while simultaneously 
possessing the ability to metabolize keratin.

Dairy and Food Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China, Jiangchang West Road 1518, Shanghai, 
200436, China.

SCOPE: Consumption of inulin could affect the intestinal microbiota composition. 
Hereby, it is aimed to investigate the intestinal microbial community 
restoration process when the inulin supplementation is terminated (i.e., the 
secondary effect).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The current study investigates the response and restoration 
of intestinal microbiota to/after high (Inulin-H) and low (Inulin-L) dosage of 
inulin supplementation or sequential antibiotics and inulin (Anti-Inulin-L) 
supplementation, based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in C57BL/6 mice. 
The number of significantly changed genera in response to inulin is highest in 
Anti-Inulin-L (n = 66) group, followed by Inulin-H (n = 51) and Inulin-L 
(n = 38) group. After inulin supplementation stops, microbiota of all studied 
groups tend to recover to their original states, with highest percentage of 
inulin-responding microbes stay significantly different at Anti-Inulin-L 
(93.94%) group, followed by Inulin-H (74.51%) and Inulin-L (44.12%) groups. Of 
note, the relative abundance of some non-inulin-responding taxa significantly 
increases during restoration.
CONCLUSION: Sequential antibiotics and inulin supplementation induce greatest 
changes in the intestinal microbial composition, followed by high and low dosage 
of inulin. Additionally, the changes induce by supplemented inulin in the 
intestinal microbial community, provide a chance for some microbes to outcompete 
the other microbes during the spontaneous restoration.

The gut and intestinal microbiota consists of trillions of microorganisms 
inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract. It plays a crucial role in human 
health leading to understanding the dynamic crosstalk of host-microbe 
interaction in the gut and has become necessary for the detection, prevention, 
or therapy of diseases. Gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases, 
suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid, and 
glucose metabolism are affected. Further, it is also altered by external insults 
such as metal toxicity, antibiotics and pesticides. Heavy metals like arsenic, 
mercury, cadmium and chromium are some of the well-studied classes of 
environmental pollutants. Mouse models have become the model of choice for most 
studies in this emerging field, as they allow perturbations in the gut 
microbiota to be studied in a controlled experimental setup. Here, we 
investigate the composition and diversity of intestinal microbes utilizing cecal 
samples from different intervention groups: arsenic exposure (As(III)), arsenic 
and piperine co-administration (As +Pp), piperine per se and control group. We 
obtained DNA samples from these groups and performed PCR amplification and 
sequencing of the 16S V3-V4 region. The findings showed shift in microbial 
composition and abundance among different intervention groups, revealing taxa 
that may contribute to the microbial diversity.

Metaorganism research contributes substantially to our understanding of the 
interaction between microbes and their hosts, as well as their co-evolution. 
Most research is currently focused on the bacterial community, while archaea 
often remain at the sidelines of metaorganism-related research. Here, we 
describe the archaeome of a total of eleven classical and emerging multicellular 
model organisms across the phylogenetic tree of life. To determine the microbial 
community composition of each host, we utilized a combination of archaea and 
bacteria-specific 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Members of the two prokaryotic 
domains were described regarding their community composition, diversity, and 
richness in each multicellular host. Moreover, association with specific hosts 
and possible interaction partners between the bacterial and archaeal communities 
were determined for the marine models. Our data show that the archaeome in 
marine hosts predominantly consists of Nitrosopumilaceae and Nanoarchaeota, 
which represent keystone taxa among the porifera. The presence of an archaeome 
in the terrestrial hosts varies substantially. With respect to abundant archaeal 
taxa, they harbor a higher proportion of methanoarchaea over the aquatic 
environment. We find that the archaeal community is much less diverse than its 
bacterial counterpart. Archaeal amplicon sequence variants are usually 
host-specific, suggesting adaptation through co-evolution with the host. While 
bacterial richness was higher in the aquatic than the terrestrial hosts, a 
significant difference in diversity and richness between these groups could not 
be observed in the archaeal dataset. Our data show a large proportion of 
unclassifiable archaeal taxa, highlighting the need for improved cultivation 
efforts and expanded databases.

Free living amoeba (FLA) are among the organisms commonly found in wastewater 
and are well-established hosts for diverse microbial communities. Despite its 
clinical significance, there is little knowledge on the FLA microbiome and 
resistome, with previous studies relying mostly on conventional approaches. In 
this study we comprehensively analyzed the microbiome, antibiotic resistome and 
virulence factors (VFs) within FLA isolated from final treated effluents of two 
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using shotgun metagenomics. Acanthamoeba has 
been identified as the most common FLA, followed by Entamoeba. The bacterial 
diversity showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) in FLA microbiomes 
obtained from the two WWTPs. At phylum level, the most dominant taxa were 
Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The most abundant 
genera identified were Enterobacter followed by Citrobacter, Paenibacillus, and 
Cupriavidus. The latter three genera are reported here for the first time in 
Acanthamoeba. In total, we identified 43 types of ARG conferring resistance to 
cephalosporins, phenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprim, quinolones, 
cephalosporins, tigecycline, rifamycin, and kanamycin. Similarly, a variety of 
VFs in FLA metagenomes were detected which included flagellar proteins, Type IV 
pili twitching motility proteins (pilH and rpoN), alginate biosynthesis genes 
AlgI, AlgG, AlgD and AlgW and Type VI secretion system proteins and general 
secretion pathway proteins (tssM, tssA, tssL, tssK, tssJ, fha, tssG, tssF, tssC 
and tssB, gspC, gspE, gspD, gspF, gspG, gspH, gspI, gspJ, gspK, and gspM). To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to examine both 
the microbiomes and resistome in FLA, as well as their potential pathogenicity 
in treated effluents. Additionally, this study showed that FLA can host a 
variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria including Paenibacillus, and 
Cupriavidus that had not previously been reported, indicating that their 
relationship may play a role in the spread and persistence of antibiotic 
resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as well as the 
evolution of novel pathogens.

Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a common antibiotic pollutant in aquatic environments, 
which is highly persistent under various conditions and significantly 
contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Biodegradation is the major 
pathway to eliminate antibiotics in the natural environment. The roles of 
bacteria and eukaryotes in the biodegradation of antibiotics have received 
considerable attention; however, their successions and co-occurrence patterns 
during the biodegradation of antibiotics remain unexplored. In this study, 
13C-labled SMX was amended to sediment samples from Zhushan Bay (ZS), West Shore 
(WS), and Gonghu Bay (GH) in Taihu Lake to explore the interplay of bacterial 
and eukaryotic communities during a 30-day incubation period. The cumulative SMX 
mineralization on day 30 ranged from 5.2 % to 19.3 %, which was the highest in 
WS and the lowest in GH. The bacterial community showed larger within-group 
interactions than between-group interactions, and the positive interactions 
decreased during incubation. However, the eukaryotic community displayed larger 
between-group interactions than within-group interactions, and the positive 
interactions increased during incubation. The proportion of negative 
interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes increased during incubation. Fifty 
genera (including 46 bacterial and 4 eukaryotic genera) were identified as the 
keystone taxa due to their dominance in the co-occurrence network and tolerance 
to SMX. The cumulative relative abundance of these keystone taxa significantly 
increased during incubation and was consistent with the SMX mineralization rate. 
These taxa closely cooperated and played vital roles in co-occurrence networks 
and microbial community interactions, signifying their crucial role in SMX 
mineralization. These findings broadened our understanding of the complex 
interactions of microorganisms under SMX exposure and their potential functions 
during SMX mineralization, providing valuable insights for in situ 
bioremediation.

As the most abundant organisms on Earth, phages play a key role in the evolution 
of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Although previous studies have demonstrated 
the molecular mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer mediated by mobile genetic 
elements, our understanding of the intertwined relationships between antibiotic 
resistance genes (ARGs) and phages is limited. In this study, we analysed 2781 
metagenomic samples to reveal the composition and species interactions of phage 
communities in different habitats as well as their capacity to carry ARGs with 
health risks. The composition of phage communities varies in different habitats 
and mainly depends on environmental conditions. Terrestrial habitats display 
more complex and robust interactions between phages than aquatic and 
human-associated habitats, resulting in the highest biodiversity of phages. 
Several types of phages in certain taxa (4.95-7.67%, mainly belonging to 
Caudoviricetes) have the capacity to carry specific ARGs and display a high 
potential risk to human health, especially in human-associated habitats. 
Overall, our results provide insights into the assembly mechanisms of phage 
communities and their effects on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

Season and location have previously been shown to be associated with differences 
in the microbiota of raw milk, especially in milk from pasture-based systems. 
Here, we further advance research in this area by examining differences in the 
raw milk microbiota from several locations across Ireland over 12 months, and by 
investigating microbiota associations with climatic variables and chemical 
composition. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to investigate the 
microbiota of raw milk collected from nine locations (n = 241). Concurrent 
chemical analysis of the protein, fat, lactose, total solids, nonprotein 
nitrogen contents, and titratable acidity (TA) of the same raw milk were 
performed. Although the raw milk microbiota was highly diverse, a core 
microbiota was found, with Pseudomonas_E, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and 
Leuconostoc present in all samples. Microbiota diversity significantly differed 
by season and location, with differences in seasonality and geography 
corresponding to 11.8% and 10.5% of the variation in the microbiota. Functional 
and antibiotic resistance profiles also varied across season and location. The 
analysis of other metadata revealed additional interactions, such as an 
association between mean daily air and grass temperatures with the abundance of 
spoilage taxa like Pseudomonas species. Correlations were identified between 
pathogenic, mastitis-related species, fat content, and the number of sun hours, 
suggesting a seasonal effect. Ultimately, this study expands our understanding 
of the interconnected nature of the microbiota, environment/climate variables, 
and chemical composition of raw milk and provides evidence of a season- and 
location-specific microbiota.
IMPORTANCE: The microbiota of raw milk is influenced by many factors that 
encourage or prevent the introduction and growth of both beneficial and 
undesirable microorganisms. The seasonal and geographical impacts on the 
microbial communities of raw milk have been previously seen, but the 
relationships with environmental factors and the chemical composition has yet to 
be investigated. In this year-long study, we found that while raw milk is highly 
diverse, a core microbiota was detected for Irish raw milk, with strong evidence 
of seasonal and geographical influence. We also found associations between 
groups of microorganisms, environmental factors, and milk composition, which 
expand current knowledge on the relationships between microbial and chemical 
composition and the climate. These results provide evidence for the development 
of a tool to allow for the prediction of raw milk quality and safety.

Free-living (FL) and particulate-associated (PA) communities are distinct 
bacterioplankton lifestyles with different mobility and dissemination routes. 
Understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of PA and FL fractions will allow 
improvement to wastewater treatment processes including pathogen and AMR 
bacteria removal. In this study, PA, FL and sediment community composition and 
antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG; tetW, ermB, sul1, intI1) dynamics were 
investigated in a full-scale municipal wastewater free-water surface polishing 
constructed wetland. Taxonomic composition of PA and FL microbial communities 
shifted towards less diverse communities (Shannon, Chao1) at the CW effluent but 
retained a distinct fraction-specific composition. Wastewater treatment plant 
derived PA communities introduced the bulk of AMR load (70 %) into the CW. 
However, the FL fraction was responsible for exporting over 60 % of the effluent 
AMR load given its high mobility and the effective immobilization (1-3 log 
removal) of PA communities. Strong correlations (r2>0.8, p < 0.05) were observed 
between the FL fraction, tetW and emrB dynamics, and amplicon sequence variants 
(ASVs) of potentially pathogenic taxa, including Bacteroides, 
Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonadaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. This study reveals 
niche differentiation of microbial communities and associated AMR in CWs and 
shows that free-living bacteria are a primary escape route of pathogenic and ARG 
load from CWs under low-flow hydraulic conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants, born weighing less than 
1,500 grams, are at risk for both gut dysbiosis and later neuropsychological 
developmental deficits. Behavioral effects, while related to neurodevelopment, 
are often more subtle and difficult to measure. The extent of later 
neurobehavioral consequences associated with such microbial dysbiosis has yet to 
be determined. We explored associations between the infants' gut microbiome and 
early childhood behavior at 4 years of age and identified the bacterial taxa 
through a multivariate analysis by linear models.
METHODS: Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) focused on 
different DSM diagnostic categories: affective, anxiety, pervasive 
developmental, attention deficit/hyperactivity, and oppositional defiant. All 
the CBCL scores were corrected for gender, delivery method, gestational age, 
infant birth weight, occurrence of sepsis, and days on antibiotics prior 
statistical analyses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to 
determine the relationship between early life gut microbiome and the adjusted 
CBCL scores. The association of bacterial Amplicon sequence Variants (ASVs) to 
the CBCL scores were tested with multivariate analysis by linear models 
(MaAsLin).
RESULTS: Nineteen children who were previously born with very low birth weight 
and studied while hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were 
included in this study. Statistically significant associations were observed 
between early life gut bacteria such as Veillonella dispar, Enterococcus, 
Escherichia coli, and Rumincococcus to later behavior at 4 years. No significant 
association could be observed with early-life gut microbiome alpha diversity and 
behavioral measures at 4 years.
DISCUSSION: These preliminary observational data provide insight into the 
relationships between VLBW gut microbiome dysbiosis and childhood behavior. This 
study contributes to the literature on gut microbiome analysis by examining 
various behavioral domains using a standardized tool linked to the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

COVID-19 is caused by an airborne virus, SARS-CoV-2. The upper respiratory tract 
(URT) is, therefore, the first system to endure the attack. Inhabited by an 
assemblage of microbial communities, a healthy URT wards off the invasion. 
However, once invaded, it becomes destabilised, which could be crucial to the 
establishment and progression of the infection. We examined 696 URT samples 
collected from 285 COVID-19 patients at three time-points throughout their 
hospital stay and 100 URT samples from 100 healthy controls. We used 16S 
ribosomal RNA sequencing to evaluate the abundance of various bacterial taxa, 
α-diversity, and β-diversity of the URT microbiome. Ordinary least squares 
regression was used to establish associations between the variables, with age, 
sex, and antibiotics as covariates. The URT microbiome in the COVID-19 patients 
was distinctively different from that of healthy controls. In COVID-19 patients, 
the abundance of 16 genera was significantly reduced. A total of 47 genera were 
specific to patients, whereas only 2 were unique to controls. The URT samples 
collected at admission differed more from the control than from the samples 
collected at later stages of treatment. The following four genera originally 
depleted in the patients grew significantly by the end of treatment: 
Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Stenotrophomonas. Our findings 
strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 caused significant changes in the URT 
microbiome, including the emergence of numerous atypical taxa. These findings 
may indicate increased instability of the URT microbiome in COVID-19 patients. 
In the course of the treatment, the microbial composition of the URT of COVID-19 
patients tended toward that of controls. These microbial changes may be 
interpreted as markers of recovery.

INTRODUCTION: Intensive beef cattle production systems are frequently implicated 
as a source of bacteria that can be transferred to nearby humans and animals via 
effluent water, manure used as fertilizer, or airborne particulate matter. It is 
crucial to understand microbial population dynamics due to manure pack 
desiccation, antibiotic usage, and antibiotic alternatives within beef cattle 
and their associated feedyard environment. Understanding how bacterial 
communities change in the presence of antibiotics can also improve management 
practices for reducing the spread of foodborne bacteria.
METHODS: In this study, we aimed to compare the microbiomes within cattle feces, 
the feedyard environment and artificially produced airborne particulate matter 
as a function of pen change and treatment with tylosin or probiotics. We 
utilized 16S rRNA sequencing to compare bacterial communities among sample 
types, study days, and treatment groups.
RESULTS: Bacterial community diversity varied as a function of sampling day and 
pen change (old or new) within fecal and manure pack samples. Manure pack 
samples from old pens and new pens contained diverse communities of bacteria on 
days 0 and 84; however, by day 119 of the study these taxonomic differences were 
less evident. Particulate matter samples exhibited significant differences in 
community diversity and predominant bacterial taxa compared to the manure pack 
they originated from. Treatment with tylosin did not meaningfully impact 
bacterial communities among fecal, environmental, or particulate matter samples; 
however, minor differences in bacterial community structure were observed in 
feces from cattle treated with probiotics.
DISCUSSION: This study was the first to characterize and compare microbial 
communities within feces, manure pack, and airborne particulate matter from the 
same location and as a function of tylosin and probiotic treatment, and pen 
change. Although fecal and environmental samples are commonly used in research 
studies and other monitoring programs to infer public health risk of bacteria 
and antimicrobial resistance determinants from feedyard environments, our study 
suggests that these samples may not be appropriate to infer public health risk 
associated with airborne particulate matter.
