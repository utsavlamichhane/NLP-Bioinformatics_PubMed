We observed multiple gray bats (Myotis grisescens) in 2022 with large patches of 
fur loss (i.e., alopecia) on the dorsal surface of their body. Alopecia in 
wildlife has been linked to multiple possible factors and often is a sign of 
suboptimal health. In 2023, we designed an experiment to compare prevalence of 
alopecia in gray bats across various reproductive stages, characterize the 
severity of alopecia lesions, and determine the ectoparasites and microbiota 
present on the regions of fur loss. We harp-trapped four summer gray bat roosts 
2-3 times between 11 April-30 August 2023 and collected skin swabs and scrapes 
from each bat with alopecia. We determined the severity of the alopecia lesions 
on a scale 0-7 by summing the degree of redness (0-2), skin condition (0-1), and 
percentage of fur loss (0-4). We cultured the skin swabs for fungal and 
bacterial growth and examined skin scrapes under a microscope to determine the 
presence of subcutaneous mites. We found no evidence that subcutaneous mites 
cause the fur loss. We determined that prevalence of alopecia in M. grisescens 
varies throughout the summer. Prevalence is highest for female bats that are or 
recently were lactating, reaching an average of 6% ± 6 SD (0-15% range) of 
captured females exhibiting fur loss during the pup rearing period. Alopecia is 
most prevalent in male bats in early summer (1% ± 2 SD; 0-4% range). Lactating 
females had more severe cases than males and were often associated with skin 
redness due to unknown causes. Bats with alopecia did not differ in body 
condition, determined from body mass, from bats without alopecia. Future studies 
could investigate the role of stress in possible autoimmune responses 
contributing to alopecia. Conservation strategies aimed at reducing stress and 
supporting nutritional requirements during the summer are likely beneficial to 
M. grisescens.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a heterogenous group of diseases with an yet unknown 
exact pathogenesis. An interplay between genetic predispositionw (mainly 
HLA-B*27 positivity), a barrier leakage (of skin and gut) and environmental 
influences, such as the contact to certain microbiota are suspected to lead to 
an activation of the immune system and through this to the development and 
maintenance of the disease.

ein Zusammenspiel zwischen genetischer Prädisposition (v. a. HLA-B*27 
Positivität), einer Barrierestörung (u. a. von Haut und Darm) und 
Umwelteinflüsse wie der Kontakt zu bestimmten Mikrobiota über eine Aktivierung 
des Immunsystems zur Entstehung und Unterhaltung der Erkrankung führen könnte.

Throughout gestation, the female body undergoes a series of transformations, 
including profound alterations in intestinal microbial communities. Changes 
gradually increase toward the end of pregnancy and comprise reduced α-diversity 
of microbial communities and an increased propensity for energy harvest. Despite 
the importance of the intestinal microbiota for the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory bowel diseases, very little is known about the relationship between 
these microbiota shifts and pregnancy-associated complications of the disease. 
Here, we explored the longitudinal dynamics of gut microbiota composition and 
functional potential during pregnancy and after lactation in Atg16l1∆IEC mice 
carrying an intestinal epithelial deletion of the Crohn's disease risk gene 
Atg16l1. Using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we 
demonstrated divergent temporal shifts in microbial composition between Atg16l1 
wildtype and Atg16l1∆IEC pregnant mice in trimester 3, which was validated in an 
independent experiment. Observed differences included microbial genera 
implicated in IBD such as Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and 
Turicibacter. Changes partially recovered after lactation. Additionally, 
metagenomic and metabolomic analyses suggest an increased capacity for chitin 
degradation, resulting in higher levels of free N-acetyl-glucosamine products in 
feces, alongside reduced glucose and myo-inositol levels in serum around the 
time of delivery. On the host side, we found that the immunological response of 
Atg16l1∆IEC mice is characterized by higher colonic mRNA levels of TNFα and 
CXCL1 in trimester 3 and a lower weight of offspring at birth. Understanding 
pregnancy-dependent microbiome changes in the context of IBD may constitute the 
first step in the identification of fecal microbial biomarkers and 
microbiota-directed therapies that could help improve precision care for 
managing pregnancies in IBD patients.

Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is not well understood 
in relation to the microbiome. Our objective was to demonstrate changes in the 
microbiota and the relationships between nutrients in children with celiac 
disease (CD) who followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). A group of 11 children who 
were recently diagnosed with CD, ranging in age from 3 to 12, were monitored for 
a period of 6 months. GFD is designed based on the individual's specific energy 
and nutrient needs, with strict control over dietary adherence. Food 
consumption, blood, and fecal samples were taken. Fecal samples were put through 
16s rRNA sequencing. Microbial modifications were demonstrated using alpha 
diversity, beta diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NDMS), 
t-test, and metastats. Mean age was 6.4 ± 2.66 years and 54.5% were male 
participants. Serological parameters were negative after 6 months. Both 
unweighted (p = .019) and weighted (p = .021) Unifrac distances were higher 
before GFD, and differences were reliable according to NDMS analysis 
(stress = 0.189). The abundance of Bacteroides ovatus was increased (p = .014), 
whereas unidentified Lachnospiraceae, Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium 
Peptostreptococcus, and Dielma were decreased after GFD (p < .001). Associations 
between nutrients and several genera and species were identified. The presence 
of genus Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was inversely 
associated with fat intake after GFD (p < .01). Microbiota changes became 
evident over a period of 6 months. The presence or absence of small bacteria may 
play a role in the development of CD. Modifying the children's dietary intake 
can potentially influence the microbial composition.

The gut serves as the body's main immunological and digestive system. 
Furthermore, host immunity is mostly managed there. Nutrients are further broken 
down and absorbed here. Numerous research investigations have shown evidence 
that inflammation, oxidative stress, impairment of the intestinal barrier, and 
imbalance in the gut microbiota can all contribute to a variety of intestinal 
illnesses and other issues, underscoring the growing significance of intestinal 
health concerns. Because of their high biological activity and lack of negative 
side effects, the organic food-derived chemicals known as brown algal 
polysaccharides-mainly fucoidan, laminaran, and alginate-have attracted a lot of 
attention from academics. Because of its many benefits, sodium alginate is one 
of the biopolymers that has garnered the greatest attention, research, and 
application. Carotenoids, which are found in our food, have several positive 
health effects. Their low solubility in water, oxidation susceptibility, 
chemical instability, accessibility, and restricted solubility in water, 
however, restrict their use in food and medicine. In this review and in 
overcoming these constraints, encapsulation might be helpful. Furthermore, the 
primary goal of our study is to provide a fresh perspective into the control and 
avoidance of intestinal diseases. It provides more potent alternatives to this 
system, clarifies the function of alginates in enhancing the encapsulation of 
carotenoids, and functions as a model for the synthesis of the intestinal 
protective agent fucoidan.

INTRODUCTION: Tunnel composting technology for preparing Agaricus subrufescens 
cultivation media can achieve a higher biological efficiency (BE) and a lower 
contamination rate (CR). However, this technology lacks in-depth and systematic 
study.
METHODS: In the present study, the changes in the microbiome and microbial 
metabolic functions were surveyed using metagenomic analysis. The 
physicochemical parameters, agronomic properties and nutritional qualities were 
also evaluated.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results showed that the contents of cellulose, 
hemicellulose and lignin dropped to 10.18, 11.58, 27.53%, respectively at the 
end of composting. The tunnel composting technology led to significant increases 
in crude protein content (32.56%) and crude fiber content (13.68%). Variations 
of physicochemical characteristics led to different successions of microbial 
communities. Bacteria manifested significantly higher abundance than fungi. 
Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, Chloroffexi and Deinococcota were the predominant 
bacterial phyla. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla in 
the thermophilic phase. Pseudonocardia, Truepera, and Thermopolyspora were 
positively correlated with the yield of A. subrufescens. In addition to TN, most 
of the physicochemical properties were significantly correlated with fungal 
communities in the thermophilic phase. The metabolisms of carbohydrate, amino 
acid and energy were the primary enrichment pathways. These findings deepen the 
understanding of microbial communities composition during the composting of A. 
subrufescens substrates. Moreover, this study provides a basis for improving 
tunnel composting technology.

INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LRa05, as an adjunct to the treatment of acute 
watery diarrhea in children.
METHODS: Eligible diarrheal children were randomized into intervention group 
(IG, n = 57) and control group (CG, n = 54), and given probiotics or placebo, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The total duration of diarrhea in the IG (121.4 ± 13.7 h) was 
significantly shorter than that in the CG (143.9 ± 19.8 h, p < 0.001). More 
children in the IG showed improvements in diarrhea than those in the CG for both 
per protocol analysis (70.2 vs. 46.3%, p = 0.01) and intention-to-treat analysis 
(66.7 vs. 41.7%, p = 0.003). The LL-37 levels in the IG was markedly higher than 
that in the CG after the intervention (4349.35 ± 1143.86 pg./g vs. 
3682.49 ± 869.21 pg./g, p = 0.039). The intervention led to higher abundance of 
Bifidobacterium longum and lower abundance of Enterococcus faecium, 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bacteroides fragilis (p < 0.05). LRa05 treatment 
upregulated the functional genes of gut microbiota involving immunity 
regulation.
DISCUSSION: Administration of the Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LRa05 at a dose 
of 5 × 109 CFU/day to children aged 0-3 years resulted in shorter duration of 
diarrhea, faster improvement in fecal consistency, and beneficial changes in gut 
microbiome composition and gene functions.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study has been approved and registered 
in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Center with the registration number 
of ChiCTR2100053700 (https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=141082).

This trial was conducted to assess the effects of different levels of dietary 
fish oil on growth performance, hepatic health, nonspecific immune responses, 
and intestinal microbial community of Amur grayling (Thymallus grubii). Five 
isonitrogenous diets containing 60 (6FO), 90 (9FO), 120 (12FO), 150 (15FO), and 
180 g/kg (18FO) fish oil were fed to triplicate groups of 60 fish per tank for 8 
weeks, respectively. The results revealed that specific growth rate (SGR) and 
weight gain (WG) of fish in the 15FO group were significantly greater than those 
in the 6FO group (p < 0.05). Somatic indices and whole-body lipid levels were 
positively correlated with increases in dietary fish oil levels. Trypsin and 
lipase activities in 15FO and 18FO groups were significantly higher than those 
in the 6FO and 9FO groups (p < 0.05). The activities of intestinal catalase 
(CAT) and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, lysozyme (LZM), alkaline 
phosphatase (AKP), and acid phosphatase (ACP) improved significantly as the 
dietary lipid content increased to 185.3 g/kg and decreased thereafter (p < 
0.05). The lipid metabolism-related genes peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma (PPARγ) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were 
significantly downregulated and upregulated (p < 0.05), respectively, in the 
15FO group. Immune-related genes in the liver and intestine, such as interleukin 
(IL-8), were significantly upregulated in the 15FO group (p < 0.05). The liver 
sections from 18FO group presented more numerous and larger lipid vacuoles. Both 
low- (6FO) and high-lipid (18FO) diets reduced the relative abundance of 
intestinal Lactococcus. The relative abundances of intestinal Staphylococcus and 
Bacillus (mainly Bacillus anthracis) increased in the low-lipid diet group and 
that of Pedobacter increased in the high-lipid diet group. Second-order 
polynomial analysis of WG and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) for varying levels 
of dietary lipid revealed that a range of 194.76-198.90 g/kg dietary lipid was 
optimal for the growth and health of Amur grayling.

SCOPE: Human milk (HM) is rich in bioactive compounds and essential nutrients. 
While research has focused on lipids, minerals, immune markers, microbiota, and 
oligosaccharides, specific metabolites are less studied. This study uses 
targeted metabolomics to identify and quantify metabolites in HM and explores 
the impact of perinatal and dietary factors on the metabolomic profile.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study of 123 healthy lactating women, 
HM samples were collected up to 1 month postpartum and analyzed using the 
Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Maternal and neonatal clinical, anthropometric, and 
nutritional data were collected. A total of 432 metabolites were quantified and 
categorized into 20 groups. The metabolomic profiles formed three distinct 
clusters, primarily driven by triglyceride concentration differences. 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were higher in HM from mothers with vaginal 
delivery compared to C-section births and differences in hexoses were found 
between exclusive and mixed-feeding practices. Maternal diets rich in lipids and 
animal proteins were associated with elevated amino acids, sphingolipids, and 
glycosyl-ceramides.
CONCLUSION: The HM metabolome was grouped into three clusters influenced by 
delivery mode, lactation practices, and maternal diet. This comprehensive 
analysis opens new avenues to explore HM composition and offers valuable 
insights for future dietary interventions aimed at modulating HM.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome has been reported to induce epigenetic 
modifications in the host, which may be involved in the pathophysiology of 
metabolic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome in subjects with different metabolic characteristics.
METHODS: Sixty-four participants with different metabolic characteristics (i.e., 
participants without obesity -healthy controls-, and participants with obesity 
and normal insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance/ type 2 diabetes-T2DM-) were 
included in this study. A machine learning approach was performed in order to 
identify distinctive patterns in three omics (gut microbiome, blood DNA 
methylome, and visceral adipose tissue-VAT- DNA methylome) according to the 
different study groups.
RESULTS: Robust distinctive distribution patterns of the three different omics 
were found between healthy controls and patients with obesity; participants with 
and without T2DM, and patients with obesity with and without insulin resistance. 
Importantly, strong correlations between the gut microbiome (including 
Odoribacteriaceae and Christensenllaceae families) and both blood and VAT DNA 
methylome were found. Moreover, in the entire study population, three main 
bacterial genera (Sutterella, Collinsella and Eubacterium) were related to the 
epigenetic regulation of different genes involved in distinct processes related 
to cellular metabolism and metabolic diseases, including small ubiquitin-related 
modifier (SUMO) transferase activity or lipid binding.
CONCLUSION: We show that distinctive interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome may occur in subjects with different metabolic characteristics. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of these interactions 
in the pathophysiology of obesity and related comorbidities.

The effects of brine acidification, glutamate addition, and starter culture on 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content of fermented cucumber were investigated. GABA 
is a nonprotein amino acid with antihypertensive, antianxiety, and 
immunomodulatory properties. It is produced during cucumber fermentation but is 
limited by the low intrinsic concentration of free glutamate. Glutamine is 
10-fold more abundant than glutamate in fresh cucumber and could provide 
additional substrate if converted to glutamate by glutaminase. Cucumbers were 
fermented in triplicate in acidified (pH 4.7-4.8) or nonacidified (pH 6.6) cover 
brines with 2% (342 mM) sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0 or 10 mM added glutamate. 
Indigenous and starter culture-assisted fermentations were conducted for each 
treatment at 28°C. The starter culture included lactobacilli containing gene 
sequences that encode for glutaminase (Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323) and 
glutamate decarboxylase (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 ATCC BAA-793). 
GABA, glutamate, and glutamine were quantified by liquid chromatography triple 
quadrupole mass spectrometry. Both indigenous and starter culture-assisted 
fermentations effectively metabolized intrinsic and added glutamate, resulting 
in 10.4 ± 2.2 mM to 14.9 ± 0.7 mM GABA in glutamate supplemented fermentations 
compared with only 1.1 ± 0.2 mM in indigenous ferments. No additional increases 
in glutamate or downstream formation of GABA were observed in nonacidified 
brines with or without starter cultures, indicating that glutaminase production 
by L. gasseri and the indigenous microbiota was minimal or absent under these 
conditions. Glutamate addition to reduced salt cucumber fermentations generated 
ready-to-eat pickles that can deliver clinically relevant levels of GABA in a 
typical serving size. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Research was conducted to explore 
ways to increase the production of the health-promoting compound, γ-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA), in fermented cucumber pickles. Cucumbers were fermented in reduced 
salt cover brines with or without added glutamate and/or acetic acid. Both 
natural and starter culture-assisted fermentations effectively converted the 
intrinsic and added glutamate to GABA, producing ready-to-eat pickles that can 
deliver clinically relevant levels of GABA in a typical serving size.

The present study evaluated the replacement of fish meal (FM) with two different 
soybean protein sources ( soybean protein concentrate (SPC) and soybean meal 
(SBM)) on the intestine microbiota of abalone Haliotis discus hannai and the 
implications for the host intestinal function and health. The control diet with 
FM as the main protein source (CON), and the four experimental diets with 50% 
and 100% SBM replacing FM (SBM50 and SBM100), and 25% and 100% SPC replacing FM 
(SPC25 and SPC100) were fed to abalone for 110 days. The intestinal microbiota 
analysis results revealed that there were no significant differences in 
α-diversity indices (Chao1, Ace, Sobs, and Shannon) among all groups. However, 
analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) demonstrated dramatic shifts in the intestinal 
microbiota component at the genus level among the groups. Venn diagram analysis 
identified 470 overlapping operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across the five 
groups, with the SBM50 and CON groups exhibiting the highest and lowest number 
of unique OTUs, respectively. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant 
phyla in abalone, with Mycoplasma being the dominant genus (CON: 42.95%; SBM50: 
23.98%; SBM100: 49.32%; SPC25: 27.20%; SPC100: 34.25%). Notably, the pathogens 
Vibrio abundance in the SPC25 group was significantly lower than in the CON 
group. The intestinal microbiota networks in the CON, SBM50, SBM100, SPC25, and 
SPC100 groups consisted of 1757, 2140, 1992, 2281 and 1747 edges, respectively. 
Furthermore, correlation heatmap results suggested that digestive enzymes and 
immune indices in abalone were associated with specific intestinal microbiota. 
Functional prediction via the KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the 
replacement levels of dietary FM with SBM and SPC significantly affect various 
biological functions of the intestinal microbiota. In summary, feeding SBM (50%) 
and SPC (25%) diets to abalone increased the abundance of beneficial bacterium 
in the intestines, contributing to improved digestion and increased growth rate 
of abalone.

BACKGROUND: Precision nutrition is based on the integration of individual´s 
phenotypical and biological characteristics including genetic variants, 
epigenetic marks, gut microbiota profiles and metabolites fingerprints as well 
as medical history, lifestyle practices, and environmental and cultural factors. 
Thus, nutriomics areas including Nutrigenomics, Nutrigenetics, Nutriepigenetics, 
Nutrimetabolomics, and Nutrimetagenomics have emerged to comprehensively 
understand the complex interactions between nutrients, diet, and the human 
body's molecular processes through precision nutrition.
SUMMARY: This document from the Ibero-American Network of Nutriomics and 
Precision Nutrition (RINN22; https://rinn22.com/) provides a comprehensive 
overview of the concepts of precision nutrition approaches to guide their 
application in clinical and public health as well as establish the position of 
RINN22 regarding the current and future state of precision nutrition.
KEY MESSAGES: The progress and participation of nutriomics to precision 
nutrition is an essential pillar for addressing diet-related diseases and 
developing innovative managing strategies, which will be promoted by advances in 
bioinformatics, machine learning and integrative software as well as the 
description of specific novel biomarkers. In this context, synthesizing and 
critically evaluating the latest developments, potential applications and future 
needs in the field of nutrition is necessary with a holistic perspective, 
incorporating progress in omics technologies aimed at precision nutrition 
interventions. This approach must address and confront healthy, social, food 
security, physically active lifestyle, sanitation and sustainability challenges 
with preventive, participatory, and predictive strategies of personalized, 
population and planetary nutrition for a precision tailored health.

Fasting the brain for mental health.

Unfavorable socioeconomic and geopolitical conditions such as poverty, violence 
and inequality increase vulnerability to mental disorders. Also, exposure to a 
poor nutrition such as high-energy dense (HED) diets has been linked to 
alterations in brain function, leading to anxiety, addiction, and depression. 
HED diets rich in saturated fatty acids or obesity can activate the innate 
immune system in the brain, especially microglia, increasing proinflammatory 
cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL1-β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), in part, 
by the stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway. Intermittent 
fasting (IF), an eating protocol characterized by alternating periods of fasting 
with periods of eating, has gained recognition as a weight-management strategy 
to reduce obesity. Accordingly, during IF inflammation and brain function can be 
modulated by production of ketone bodies and modulation of the intestinal 
microbiota, which also promote the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), which is involved in neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity. 
Although IF has contributed to reduce body weight and improve metabolic 
profiles, its influence on mental health remains an evolving field of research. 
Here, we provide experimental evidence supporting the role of IF reducing 
neuroinflammation as a valuable approach to improve mental health.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that microbial communities differ in 
obese and lean individuals, and dietary fiber can help reduce obesity-related 
conditions through diet-gut microbiota interactions. However, the mechanisms by 
which dietary fibers shape the gut microbiota still need to be elucidated. In 
this in vitro study, we examined how apple fibers affect lean and obese 
microbial communities on a global scale. We employed a high-throughput 
micro-matrix bioreactor system and a multi-omics approach to identify the key 
microorganisms and metabolites involved in this process.
RESULTS: Initially, metagenomics and metabolomics data indicated that obese and 
lean microbial communities had distinct starting microbial communities. We found 
that obese microbial community had different characteristics, including higher 
levels of Ruminococcus bromii and lower levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
along with an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio. Afterward, we exposed 
obese and lean microbial communities to an apple as a representative complex 
food matrix, apple pectin as a soluble fiber, and cellulose as an insoluble 
fiber. Dietary fibers, particularly apple pectin, reduced Acidaminococcus 
intestini and boosted Megasphaera and Akkermansia in the obese microbial 
community. Additionally, these fibers altered the production of metabolites, 
increasing beneficial indole microbial metabolites. Our results underscored the 
ability of apple and apple pectin to shape the obese gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: We found that the obese microbial community had higher 
branched-chain amino acid catabolism and hexanoic acid production, potentially 
impacting energy balance. Apple dietary fibers, especially pectin, influenced 
the obese microbial community, altering both species and metabolites. Notably, 
the apple pectin feeding condition affected species like Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Bifidobacterium longum. By using genome-scale metabolic modeling, we 
discovered a mutualistic cross-feeding relationship between Megasphaera sp. 
MJR8396C and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. This in vitro study suggests that 
incorporating apple fibers into the diets of obese individuals can help modify 
the composition of gut bacteria and improve metabolic health. This personalized 
approach could help mitigate the effects of obesity. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: Heat stress (HS) incidence is associated with the accumulation of 
reactive substances, which might be associated with bone loss. N-Acetylcysteine 
(NAC) exhibits strong antioxidants due to its sulfhydryl group and being as the 
precursor for endogenous glutathione synthesis. Therefore, interplay between 
oxidative stress and bone turnover of broilers and the effects of dietary NAC 
inclusion on antioxidant capability and "gut-bone" axis were evaluated during 
chronic HS.
RESULTS: Implementing cyclic chronic HS (34 °C for 7 h/d) evoked reactive oxygen 
species excessive production and oxidant stress, which was accompanied by 
compromised tibia mass. The RNA-seq of proximal tibia also revealed the 
enrichment of oxidation-reduction process and inflammatory outbursts during HS. 
Although no notable alterations in the growth performance and cecal microbiota 
were found, the diet contained 2 g/kg NAC enhanced the antioxidant capability of 
heat-stressed broiler chickens by upregulating the expression of Nrf2 in the 
ileum, tibia, and bone marrow. Simultaneously, NAC tended to hinder NF-κB 
pathway activation and decreased the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory 
cytokines in both the ileum and bone marrow. As a result, NAC suppressed 
osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, thereby increasing osteocyte-related 
gene expression. Furthermore, the inclusion of NAC tended to increase the ash 
content and density of the whole tibia, as well as improve cortical thickness 
and bone volume of the diaphysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings HS-mediated outburst of oxidant stress accelerates 
bone resorption and negatively regulates the bone quality of tibia, which is 
inhibited by NAC in broilers.

For a long time, traditional medicine has acknowledged the gut's impact on 
general health. Contemporary science substantiates this association through 
investigations of the gut microbiota, the extensive community of microorganisms 
inhabiting our gastrointestinal system. These microscopic residents considerably 
improve digestive processes, nutritional absorption, immunological function, and 
pathogen defense. Nevertheless, a variety of gastrointestinal and 
extra-intestinal disorders can result from dysbiosis, an imbalance of the 
microbial composition of the gut microbiota. A groundbreaking discovery is the 
gut-brain axis, a complex communication network that links the enteric and 
central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication allows the brain 
to influence gut activities and vice versa, impacting mental health and mood 
disorders like anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota can influence this 
communication by creating neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids, among 
other biochemical processes. These factors may affect our mental state, our 
ability to regulate our emotions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis. This study aimed to explore the complex interrelationships between the 
brain and the gut microbiota. We also conducted a thorough examination of the 
existing understanding in the area of how microbiota affects social behaviors, 
including emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions. We also explored 
the potential of interventions that focus on the connection between the gut and 
the brain, such as using probiotics to treat diseases of the CNS. This research 
opens up new possibilities for addressing mental health and neurological 
conditions in an innovative manner.

The hepatoprotective potential of tomato juice (TJ) has been reported in chronic 
liver models, and its potential prebiotic properties may be key to its 
preventative effects. However, the mechanistic role of the gut microbiota and 
its derived metabolites in ameliorating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) via 
TJ remains unclear. In this study, we explored how TJ regulates gut microbiota 
and succinic acid (SA) to restore intestinal barrier function and thus suppress 
NASH progression. TJ supplementation effectively reduced serum lipid 
concentrations, alleviated endotoxin levels, and suppressed activation of the 
endotoxin-TLR4-NF-κB pathway in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced 
NASH mice. TJ restored the MCD diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased 
the abundance of short-chain fatty acid and SA-producing bacteria 
(Bifidobacterium, Ileibacterium, Odoribacter, and Parasutterella) and enhanced 
the expression of intestinal barrier-associated proteins (E-cadherin, Claudin-1, 
MUC-2, and ZO-1). The hepatoprotective and enteroprotective effects of TJ were 
abolished in an antibiotic-treated mouse model, underscoring the pivotal role of 
the gut microbiota in the beneficial effects of TJ on NASH. Fecal metabolomics 
demonstrated that TJ significantly upregulated the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
pyruvate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism pathways, increasing levels of 
butyric acid (BA) and SA-metabolites associated with reduced hepatic steatosis 
and intestinal damage. We further found that the physiological concentration of 
SA, rather than BA, could reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) 
levels and enhance mucin proteins and tight junction markers in the LPS-induced 
colon cell line LS174T. This study uncovers new mechanisms by which TJ prevents 
NASH, highlighting the potential of TJ and SA as effective dietary supplements 
for patients with chronic liver diseases.

Based on the modified traditional Chinese formula, Compound Oolong tea (WLT) is 
composed of six herbal medicines which have beneficial effects. The present 
study aimed to assess the effects of WLT on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota 
in the mouse obesity model.Totally 32 mice were randomized into 4 groups 
including normal control (NC), high-fat diet model (HFD), positive control (PC) 
receiving atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/d, and WLT group with WLT water extra 
300 mg/kg/d. The HFD, PC, WLT groups were fed a High-fat Diet. The results show 
that body weight, Lee's index, liver index and fat index were reduced in WLT. 
Moreover, the accumulation of TC, TG, and LDL-C were lower, and the level of 
serum HDL-C in WLT was higher than HFD. The activities of ALT and AST were 
reduced, and the glucose tolerance was improved in WLT. Furthermore, the 
relative gene expression of hepatic such as Pparγ, Lxr, Srebp-1c, Srebp-2, 
Scd-1, Acc-1, Fas were upregulated, and Hmgcr was downregulated in WLT compared 
to HFD. The relative protein expression of PPARγ, SREBP-1, FAS, and SCD-1 were 
decreased, and p-AMPK/AMPK and p-ACC-1/ACC-1 were increased in WLT compared with 
HFD. In addition, the diversity of gut microbiota was increased in mice, with an 
increase in Bacteroidota and a decrease in Firmicutes and Desulfovibrionales 
were decreased in WLT, compared with HFD. Briefly, WLT improves hepatic lipid 
metabolism through the AMPK-PPAR pathway and regulates the gut microbiome. These 
findings suggest that WLT could potentially be used as a functional food 
ingredients for preventing obesity.

Dietary oligo- and polysaccharides modulate gut microbiota and thus exert 
prebiotic activity, which is determined by their heterogeneous structure. To 
explore the correlations between monosaccharide profile and microbial community, 
simulated gut fermentation of different glycans, including arabinan (ArB), 
galactooligosaccharide (GOS), arabinogalactan (ArG), rhamnogalacturonan (RhG), 
and xyloglucan (XyG) that are characterized by typical sugar residues were 
performed. Results showed that RhG displayed high contents of galacturonic acid 
(344.79 mg/g), rhamnose (171.70 mg/g), and galactose (151.77 mg/g), and the 
degradation ratio of them after fermentation was 73.87 %, 84.96 %, and 87.11 %, 
respectively. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of glycan-degrading bacteria 
Bacteroides in the RhG was boosted from 4 h (4.97 %) to 48 h (36.45 %). 
Butyrate-generating bacteria Megasphaera (56.69 %) and Bifidobacterium (28.02 %) 
are dominant genera in the ArB, which generated the highest concentration of 
carbohydrate-metabolite (94.58 mmol/L) in terms of acetate, propionate, butyrate 
and valerate, followed by the ArG (87.36 mmol/L). However, ammonia generation of 
the ArG increased rapidly, representing the highest content of 
protein-metabolite (66.36 mmol/L) including ammonia, isobutyrate, and 
isovalerate. As compared, metabolites generated from protein and carbohydrates 
grow steadily at a low level during the XyG fermentation. Correlation analysis 
further indicated that Bacteroides was positively correlated with propionate 
(p < 0.001), galacturonic acid (p < 0.001), and rhamnose (p < 0.05), while 
Bifidobacterium has positive correlation with butyrate and arabinose (p < 0.01). 
Overall, monosaccharides composition in the different oligo- and polysaccharides 
induces distinct responses of the dominant microbiota and thus modulates the 
subsequent fermentation metabolites of carbohydrate and protein, promoting a 
deep understanding of the structure-fermentation relationship of dietary 
glycans.

Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL) are a promising and sustainable alternative to 
obtain proteins. Due to their high growth rate and ability to use different 
substrates as feeding stocks, BSFL can be also used to valorize food waste. 
Thus, the aim of this research was to unravel the potential use of Spent Coffee 
Grounds (SCG) and blood meal alone or mixed as feedstocks for BSFL and the 
nutritional changes for BSFL meal, especially after simulated human in vitro 
digestion and fermentation. Chicken feed was used as a control. Chicken feed 
showed the highest BSFL growth (P < 0.05) compared with blood meal and the mix 
made of blood meal and SCG; the latter caused the lowest growth. The meal 
obtained from BSFL fed with blood meal had the highest protein content, as well 
as the highest levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced after in vitro 
fermentation by the human gut microbiota. On the other hand, the meal from 
larvae fed with SCG showed higher antioxidant capacity than the others in the 
DPPH, FRAP and ABTS assays. The digestibility of macronutrients, release of 
antioxidant capacity and production of SCFAs of the BSFL meal were improved when 
using these substrates, compared to chicken feed.

The microbial safety and quality properties of fresh-cut peppers (Capsicum 
annuum L.) are influenced by disinfection. In this study, the effects of 
disinfection on the microbial community composition and quality attributes of 
green peppers stored at 4 ℃ for 8 days were investigated. The findings revealed 
that disinfection effectively reduced the total bacterial counts to 
approximately 6 log CFU/g at the end of storage compared to undisinfection 
samples (>7 log CFU/g) and altered bacterial community composition. Moreover, 
disinfection suppressed adverse changes in texture, maintained color by delaying 
chlorophyll degradation, and inhibited the accumulation of 12 screened key 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that produced mixed undesirable flavors, such 
as 2-hexenal and (E, E)-2,4-decadienal. Through the correlation analysis of 
microbiota and quality indicators, Pseudomonas was considered a marker of 
quality deterioration because of its significant negative correlation with 
firmness and positive correlations with ΔE and odor-causing VOCs, and 
disinfection decreased the relative abundance of this bacterium over time. These 
findings will provide vital guidance for fresh-cut pepper practices.

Prenatal stress (PNS) has widespread effects on offspring, including aberrant 
immune development and behavioural deficits. The microbiome is a mediator of the 
dissemination of stress effects to the offspring through immunomodulation and 
metabolite production. Metabolites derived from the mother and their gut 
microbiota pass to the foetus and can affect immune and nervous development. 
Stress affects the abundance of such metabolites, including the tryptophan (Trp) 
pathway, which are involved in immune and nervous system function. We 
hypothesized that the PNS is associated with dysregulation of Trp metabolism. We 
further posited that treatment with a Trp-metaboliser Parasutterella 
excrementihominis would abrogate PNS-associated deleterious effects on offspring 
development. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice were exposed to restraint 
stress and administered P. excrementihominis (Dam n = 3-9; Offspring n = 5-10). 
PNS increased maternal gut Trp and both maternal and offspring inflammation. P. 
excrementihominis treatment reduced the PNS-induced excess pool of maternal gut 
Trp. Some PNS effects on foetal neuroinflammation were reduced in severity due 
to handling effects from bacterial gavage. However, P. excrementihominis was 
anti-inflammatory in dam and offspring and anxiolytic in offspring of Pe-treated 
dams. These data illustrate that elevated Trp levels are associated PNS and its 
downstream deleterious offspring inflammatory and behavioural outcomes while P. 
excrementihominis, a Trp-metabolizer, can ameliorate these effects and improve 
offspring outcomes.

Since animal growth promoters (AGPs) are used in large quantities and commonly 
released to the environment from animal farms, it is necessary to determine 
whether such agents should be regarded as an environmental toxin that poses a 
threat to the ecosystem and health risk to wildlife. In this study, a 
multi-omics approach was employed to explore the effects of a representative 
AGP, lincomycin, on key metabolic and physiological functions of animals, using 
a mouse model. The results indicated that exposure to lincomycin resulted in a 
significant increase in growth rate of mice (50.11 %) over an 8 weeks period, 
during which significant decrease (61.94 %) and increase (68.64 %) in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Escherichia coli, respectively, was 
observed in the gut microbiota, indicating that the gut microbiota structure has 
been altered. Moreover, the mice exhibited altered lipid profiles and liver 
damage suggestive of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Disruptions in blood glucose and insulin levels associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also observed. Furthermore, lincomycin was found to cause 
suppression in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of 
related genes and elevated inflammatory mediators, potentially resulting in 
increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Our findings underscore the 
detrimental effects of lincomycin on animal health and highlight the necessity 
for comprehensive toxicological assessments of lincomycin and other AGPs before 
their environmental release.

To date, few study explored the damage of chronic dietary exposure to the 
lipophilic pesticide deltamethrin (DM) in aquatic animals, and it remains 
unclear whether its toxicity and residue levels would be affected by dietary 
lipid levels. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the interactions 
between dietary lipid levels and DM levels in the Pacific white shrimp, focusing 
on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microbiota. DM has 
excellent insecticidal activity and has been used worldwide. Previous research 
has shown that environmental DM poses toxicity risks to aquatic animals. Six 
different diets were formulated to feed shrimp for 6 weeks with two lipid levels 
(6.96 %, 10.88 %) and three DM levels (0.2 mg·kg-1, 1 mg·kg-1, 5 mg·kg-1), 
namely LF0.2, LF1, LF5, HF0.2, HF1, HF5, respectively. Each diet was assigned to 
three net cages with a total of 18 cages (40 shrimp per tank, average weight 
(0.382±0.001 g), of which 0.2 mg·kg-1, are grouped in environmental DM control 
groups. The growth of shrimp was reduced as the dietary DM levels increased. 
When shrimp were fed a diet containing a high dose of DM, a reduction in their 
antioxidant capacity was also observed. Enzyme activity and gene expression 
related to lipid metabolism in hepatopancreas and hemolymph indicated a 
significant interaction between dietary lipid levels and DM in the lipid 
metabolism of shrimp. The terms of detoxification-related genes (gst, sult, 
cyp1a1) were upregulated in shrimp fed the high-dose DM. Additionally, the 
presence of DM in the diet severely harmed the hepatopancreas and intestinal 
histological morphology. DM in the diet increased the susceptibility of shrimp 
to pathogens and induced intestine microbiota dysbiosis, disrupting the balance 
of inter-species interactions. DM was not detected in the muscle and 
hepatopancreas of the shrimp after six weeks of exposure. In conclusion, the 
presence of DM in feed reduced the growth performance and antioxidant capacity 
of shrimp, damaging intestinal health. DM was rapidly metabolized by shrimp.

A strong association exists between the high-fat diet (HFD) and the incidence of 
obesity, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease, affecting an increasing 
number of individuals. More and more research has shown that probiotics and gut 
microbiota play important roles in dietary absorption, metabolism, and general 
health of the host. This aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic 
effects and the underlying mechanisms of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TCCC11824 
(CGMCC 8198) on hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice and humans. First, there was 
a dose-dependent improvement in HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice 
that had been treated with L. plantarum TCCC11824 for 5 wk, thus restoring the 
balance of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, it showed that cell lysate of L. 
plantarum TCCC11824 could directly exhibit protective effects on the hepatocyte 
steatosis induced by oleic acid, and regulate the expression of HMGCR by 
inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, L.plantarum TCCC11824 ameliorated the 
expression of indicators of hyperlipidemia and inhibited the synthesis of SCFAs 
(short-chain fatty acids), as shown by blood and fecal tests in hyperlipidemic 
patients. In summary, L. plantarum TCCC11824 exerts anti-hyperlipidemic and 
anti-obesity effects through the regulation of HMGCR via NF-κB and modulating 
gut microbiota, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the 
treatment of hyperlipidemia and obesity.

Fecal matter is recognized as both a reservoir and a transmission source for 
various antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs). However, the transcriptional 
activity of AMRGs in swine feces is not well understood. In addition, the effect 
of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the excretion of AMRGs has rarely 
been reported. Our study explored the diversity, abundance, transcriptional 
activity, and bacterial hosts of AMRGs in Tibetan and Duroc pig feces using 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing technologies. We discovered a 
significantly higher genomic abundance of AMRGs in the feces of Duroc pigs 
compared to Tibetan pigs (P < 0.001), although the transcript levels did not 
show a significant difference. The results showed that the core composition of 
AMRGs in pig feces varied considerably, with the most transcriptionally active 
AMRGs being oqxB, tetQ, Bla1, dfrA1, and amrB. Furthermore, the Firmicutes 
phylum is the main host of AMRGs. By transplanting fecal flora from Tibetan and 
Duroc pigs into the intestines of Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets after 
acute antibiotic exposure, we found that only Tibetan pig fecal flora 
significantly reduced AMRGs in the feces of DLY piglets (P < 0.05). The 
effectiveness of Tibetan pig fecal microorganisms in removing AMRGs from DLY pig 
feces was mainly influenced by microbial communities, especially the 
Bacteroidota phylum. These findings offer valuable insights for the prevention 
and control of AMRG pollution.
IMPORTANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first 
comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance gene (AMRGs) expression in 
the fecal microbiota of Tibetan and Duroc pigs, employing an integrated 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach. Our findings indicate a higher risk 
of AMRGs transmission in the feces of Duroc pigs compared to Tibetan pigs. Given 
the escalating antimicrobial resistance crisis, novel therapeutic interventions 
are imperative to mitigate gut colonization by pathogens and AMRGs. In this 
regard, we investigated the impact of fecal microbiota from Tibetan and Duroc 
pig sources on AMRGs excretion in Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets' feces 
following acute antibiotic exposure. Remarkably, only fecal microbiota sourced 
from Tibetan pigs exhibited a reduction in AMRGs excretion in DLY piglets' 
feces. This underscores the significance of evaluating the presence of AMRGs 
within donor fecal microbiota for effective AMRGs decolonization strategies.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a global health problem with limited 
therapeutic options. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to this disorder are 
not yet fully understood, and in this respect, metabolomics represents a 
promising approach to decipher metabolic events related to AUD. The plasma 
metabolome contains a plethora of bioactive molecules that reflects the 
functional changes in host metabolism but also the impact of the gut microbiome 
and nutritional habits.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the impact of severe AUD (sAUD), and of 
a 3-week period of alcohol abstinence, on the blood metabolome (non-targeted 
LC-MS metabolomics analysis) in 96 sAUD patients hospitalized for alcohol 
withdrawal.
RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of different lipids 
((lyso)phosphatidylcholines, long-chain fatty acids), short-chain fatty acids 
(i.e. 3-hydroxyvaleric acid) and bile acids were altered in sAUD patients. In 
addition, several microbial metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid, 
p-cresol sulfate, hippuric acid, pyrocatechol sulfate, and metabolites belonging 
to xanthine class (paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline) were sensitive to 
alcohol exposure and alcohol withdrawal. 3-Hydroxyvaleric acid, caffeine 
metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) and microbial 
metabolites (hippuric acid and pyrocatechol sulfate) were correlated with 
anxiety, depression and alcohol craving. Metabolomics analysis in postmortem 
samples of frontal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid of those consuming a high 
level of alcohol revealed that those metabolites can be found also in brain 
tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data allow the identification of neuroactive metabolites, from 
interactions between food components and microbiota, which may represent new 
targets arising in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases such as sAUD.
FUNDING: Gut2Behave project was initiated from ERA-NET NEURON network (Joint

Bacteria host various foreign genetic elements, most notably plasmids and 
bacteriophages (or phages). Historically, these two classes were seen as 
separate, but recent research has shown considerable interplay between them. 
Phage-plasmids (P-Ps) exhibit characteristics of both phages and plasmids, 
allowing them to exist extrachromosomally within bacterial hosts as plasmids, 
but also to infect and lyse bacteria as phages. This dual functionality enables 
P-Ps to utilize the modes of transmission of both phage and plasmids, 
facilitating the rapid dissemination of genetic material, including antibiotic 
resistance and virulence genes, throughout bacterial populations. Additionally, 
P-Ps have been found to encode toxin-antitoxin and CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune 
systems, which enhance bacterial survival under stress and provide immunity 
against other foreign genetic elements. Despite a growing body of literature on 
P-Ps, large gaps remain in our understanding of their ecological roles and 
environmental prevalence. This review aims to synthesise existing knowledge and 
identify research gaps on the impacts of P-Ps on microbial communities.

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become popular in recent years, however, the 
detrimental effects of their excessive consumption have also become evident. 
Acrylamide (AA), a processing hazard present in UPFs, can further aggravate the 
harmful effects of UPFs. AA can cause significant damage to both the intestinal 
barrier and gut microbiota, thereby affecting the nervous system through the 
microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Natural polysaccharides have demonstrated the 
capacity to significantly alleviate the oxidative stress and inflammatory 
response associated with AA exposure. In addition, they exhibit neuroprotective 
properties that may be mediated through the MGB axis. This paper reviews 
literature on the presence of AA in certain UPFs and its potential to inflict 
serious harm on the human gut microbiota and brain. Moreover, the possibility of 
utilizing polysaccharides as a preventative measure against AA-induced 
neurotoxicity was also proposed. These findings provide new insights into the 
safety risks associated with the overconsumption of UPFs and highlight the 
potential of polysaccharides to counteract the neurodegeneration induced by AA.

Contemporary scientific discussions are increasingly focusing on Akkermansia 
muciniphila due to its complex influence on intestinal physiology. This article 
provides a comprehensive analysis of the various effects Akkermansia muciniphila 
has on intestinal inflammation, while also exploring its potential associations 
with obesity and cardiovascular diseases. A systematic literature search was 
conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate with the following 
keywords: Akkermansia muciniphila, obesity, cardiovascular risk, and 
inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of our mini-review was to examine the 
impact of Akkermansia bacteria on the intestines, cardiovascular system, and its 
relationship with obesity. Through a detailed review of current literature, the 
article seeks to elucidate the complex interactions of Akkermansia muciniphila 
within the human body, highlighting its potential contributions to health 
improvement and medical interventions. Research indicates that Akkermansia 
muciniphila positively correlates with maintaining intestinal health, modulating 
the cardiovascular system, and aiding in weight management. However, the number 
of studies available is small, and the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila on 
human health require further research.

INTRODUCTION: Disorders of acid-base balance in the rumen of dairy cows have a 
significant impact on their health and performance. However, the effect of 
transient differences in pH on susceptibility to subacute ruminal acidosis 
(SARA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis in dairy cows remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, milk, serum, and rumen fluid samples from 40 Holstein 
dairy cows (on d 56 postpartum) with different rumen pH (2-4 h after morning 
feeding) were explored to investigate the difference of susceptibility to SARA 
and the correlation between microbiome, LPS and inflammation. These cows were 
categorized into low pH (LPH, pH ≤ 6.0, n = 20) and high pH (HPH, pH ≥ 6.5, 
n = 20) groups.
RESULTS: The results showed that LPH group increased the concentrations of total 
volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate. However, milk 
yield and milk compositions were unaffected. Compared to the HPH group, the LPH 
group increased the concentrations of serum BHBA, NEFA, LPS, HIS, IL-2, IL-6, 
TNF-α, and MDA, and decreased the concentrations of serum IgA, IgM, IgG, SOD, 
T-AOC, and mTOR. In addition, the LPH group decreased the copies of Ruminococcus 
flavefaciens and increased the copies of Fibrobacter succinogenes. Microbial 
community analysis isupplendicated a significant difference in bacterial 
composition between the two groups. At the phylum level, Bacteroidota and 
Firmicutes were enriched in the LPH and HPH groups, respectively. At the genus 
level, the dominant bacteria in the LPH group were Prevotella. Additionally, the 
LPH group increased the proportions of Gram-negative phenotypes, potentially 
pathogenic phenotypes and LPS biosynthesis. The close correlation between two 
key enzymes for LPS synthesis LpxL and LpxM with rumen pH, inflammatory markers, 
and microorganisms indicates that low pH may increase the risk of inflammation 
by facilitating the lysis of Gram-negative bacteria and the release of 
penta-acylated LPS. Penta-acylated and hexa-acylated LPS may be mainly derived 
from Prevotella and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-001, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Overall, these results support the notion that transient low pH 
could reflect the risk of cows suffering from SARA and associated inflammation 
and is strongly associated with penta-acylated LPS. Our findings provide new 
insights into ruminant health improvement and disease prevention strategies.

The consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has surged globally, raising 
significant public health concerns due to their associations with a range of 
adverse health outcomes. This review aims to elucidate potential health impacts 
of UPF intake and underscore the importance of considering diet quality when 
interpreting study findings. UPF group, as classified by the Nova system based 
on the extent of industrial processing, contains numerous individual food items 
with a wide spectrum of nutrient profiles, as well as differential quality as 
reflected by their potential health effects. The quality of a given food may 
well misalign with the processing levels so that a UPF food can be nutritious 
and healthful whereas a non-UPF food can be of low quality and excess intake of 
which may lead to adverse health consequences. The current review argues that it 
is critical to focus on the nutritional content and quality of foods and their 
role within the overall dietary pattern rather than only the level of 
processing. Further research should dissect health effects of diet quality and 
food processing, investigate the health impacts of ingredients that render the 
UPF categorization, understand roles of metabolomics and the gut microbiome in 
mediating and modulating the health effects of food processing, and consider 
environmental sustainability in UPF studies. Emphasizing nutrient-dense 
healthful foods and dietary patterns shall remain the pivotal strategy for 
promoting overall health and preventing chronic diseases.

Harnessing the plant microbiome through plant genetics is of increasing interest 
to those seeking to improve plant nutrition and health. While genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to identify plant genes driving 
the plant microbiome, more multidisciplinary studies are required to assess the 
relationships among plant genetics, plant microbiome and plant fitness. Using a 
metabarcoding approach, we characterized the rhizosphere bacterial communities 
of a core collection of 155 Medicago truncatula genotypes along with the plant 
phenotype and investigated the plant genetic effects through GWAS. The different 
genotypes within the M. truncatula core collection showed contrasting growth and 
nutritional strategies but few loci were associated with these ecophysiological 
traits. To go further, we described its associated rhizosphere bacterial 
communities, dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and 
defined a core rhizosphere bacterial community. Next, the occurrences of 
bacterial candidates predicting plant ecophysiological traits of interest were 
identified using random forest analyses. Some of them were heritable and plant 
loci were identified, pinpointing genes related to response to hormone stimulus, 
systemic acquired resistance, response to stress, nutrient starvation or 
transport, and root development. Together, these results suggest that plant 
genetics can affect plant growth and nutritional strategies by harnessing 
keystone bacteria in a well-connected interaction network.

The composition of feed significantly influences the growth performance and gut 
microbiota of broiler chicks, impacting their overall health and productivity. 
This study aimed to investigate the effects of cassava pellets and enzymes 
supplementation on the growth performance, meat quality, serum biochemical 
indices, and cecal microbial community of broiler chicks. A total of 144 healthy 
1-day-old AA broilers were randomly assigned to six dietary groups: basal diet 
(K1), basal diet + 5 % cassava pellets (K2), basal diet + 10 % cassava pellets 
(K3), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets (K4), basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets 
+ 0.3 % tannase (K5), and basal diet + 20 % cassava pellets + 0.3 % tannase + 
2500 U/kg α-amylase (K6). At 21 days, growth performance, meat quality, serum 
biochemical indices, and cecal microbial composition were analyzed. Compared to 
K1, the end weight was significantly higher in the K3 and K5 groups (P < 0.05); 
average daily weight gain was significantly higher in the K3 and K6 groups (P < 
0.05); and the feed-to-weight ratio was lower in the K3 group (P < 0.05). Cecal 
microbiota analysis revealed that the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and 
Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla. Alpha diversity showed a significant 
increase in the Chao index in the K3 group and in the Shannon and Simpson 
indices in the K6 group compared to the K1 group (P < 0.05). Beta diversity 
indicated similar microbial compositions across groups. LEfSe analysis showed 
increased numbers of specific bacteria in treated groups. Serum analysis 
revealed significantly higher ALT levels in the K4 group and higher IBIL levels 
in the K5 group (P < 0.05), with Bacteroides plebeius and Megamonas positively 
correlated with ALT (P < 0.05). The addition of 10 % cassava pellets to the diet 
improved the growth performance and meat quality of broilers from 1 to 21 days 
of age and enhanced the microbial composition, providing valuable insights for 
optimizing broiler diets and improving economic returns.

University, Ankara, Türkiye.

The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, affecting metabolic, 
immune, and cognitive functions. While the impact of various dietary components 
on the microbiome is well-studied, the effect of legumes remains less explored. 
This review examines the influence of legume consumption on gut microbiome 
composition, diversity, and metabolite production, based on 10 human and 21 
animal studies. Human studies showed mixed results, with some showing increased 
microbial diversity and others finding no significant changes. However, legume 
consumption was linked to increases in beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium 
and Faecalibacterium. Animal studies generally indicated enhanced microbial 
diversity and composition changes, though these varied by legume type and the 
host's health. Some studies highlighted legume-induced shifts in bacteria 
associated with better metabolic health. Overall, the review emphasizes the 
complexity of legume-microbiome interactions and the need for standardized 
methodologies and longitudinal studies. While legumes have the potential to 
positively affect the gut microbiome, the effects are nuanced and depend on 
context. Future research should investigate the long-term impacts of legume 
consumption on microbiome stability and its broader health implications, 
particularly for disease prevention and dietary strategies.

Chicken gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining their 
physiological health. However, the cultivability of chicken gut microbiota is 
not well understood, limiting the exploration of certain key gut bacteria in 
regulating intestinal health and nutritional metabolism. This study aimed to 
examine the cultivability of chicken cecal microbiota and to provide guidance 
for future chicken gut microbiota cultivation. A total of 58 different culture 
conditions were applied to culture broiler cecal microbiota, and the 
culture-dependent (CD; pooled colonies form each plate) and culture-independent 
(CI; broiler cecal contents) samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
and microbial analysis. The CD methods detected higher microbial richness (3,636 
vs 2,331 OTUs) than CI methods, and the recovery rates of bacterial OTUs and 
genera reached 43.6% and 68.9%, respectively. The genera of Bacteroides (19.9%), 
Alistipes (11.0%) and Barnesiella (10.7%) were highly abundant detected by CI 
methods, however, there occupied a small proportion (<1.0%) of total cultured 
microbiota in CD methods. We then developed reference figures and tables showing 
optimal cultivation conditions for different gut bacteria taxa. Moreover, 81 
different lactic acid bacteria strains covering 5 genera were isolated, and 15 
strains had less than 97.0% similarity to known bacteria in the national center 
for biotechnology information (NCBI) online database. Overall, this study 
provides preliminary guidance in culturing specific gut microbiota from 
chickens, which will contribute to future studies to characterize the biological 
functions of key microbes in chicken nutritional metabolism and health.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of fermented soybean meal (FSM) on 
milk production, blood parameters, and rumen fermentation and microbial 
community in dairy cows. In this study, 48 healthy Holstein cows (parity, 
3.0 ± 0.6; days in milk, 86.0 ± 6.7) were used. Cows were randomly assigned into 
four groups (CON, T-200, T-400, and T-600) with 12 cows per group. Cows in CON 
were not supplemented with FSM. Cows in T-200, T-400, and T-600 were 
supplemented with 200, 400, and 600 g/head/day FSM, respectively. This study 
lasted 5 weeks (1-week adaptation and 4-week treatment). The results showed that 
FSM did not affect milk yield and milk components (p > 0.05). In the serum, FSM 
greatly increased prolactin (p < 0.01), and a dosage effect was observed. 
Aspartate aminotransferase and total protein were the highest in the T-400 
(p < 0.05), and triglycerides was the lowest in T-200 (p < 0.05), and there was 
no difference for the 3 measurements between the other 3 groups (p > 0.05). In 
the rumen, FSM did not affect pH, microbial crude protein, acetate, propionate, 
butyrate, valerate, total volatile fatty acids and the ratio of 
acetate:propionate (p > 0.05), only changed NH3-N, isobutyrate and isovalerate 
(p < 0.05). The results of the rumen bacterial 16S rRNA genes sequencing showed 
that FSM decreased the richness (p < 0.05) and evenness (p < 0.05) of the 
bacterial communities. PCoA analysis showed that FSH altered the rumen bacterial 
community (ANOSIM, R = 0.108, p = 0.002). In the relative abundance of phyla, 
FSM increased Firmicutes (p = 0.015) and Actinobacteriota (p < 0.01) and 
Patescibacteria (p = 0.012), decreased Bacteroidota (p = 0.024). In the relative 
abundance of genera, FSM increased Christensenellaceae R-7 group (p = 0.011), 
Lactococcus (p < 0.01), Candidatus Saccharimonas (p < 0.01), Olsenella 
(p < 0.01), decreased Muribaculaceae_norank (p < 0.01). Conclusively, 
supplemented FSM altered the rumen fermentation parameters and bacterial 
community, and increased serum prolactin level in lactating Holstein cows. These 
findings may provide an approach to keep the peak of lactation in dairy cows.

Nanotechnology (Nano) applications of feed additives can potentially improve 
feed-substrate efficiency to enhance livestock productivity. The utilization of 
Nano in feed in ruminants still tends to be under-explored and reviewed, 
particularly the application of Nano in trace minerals to enhance the 
reproductive performance and productivity of ruminants such as selenium. Trace 
minerals are essential for animal well-being and productivity, and the 
bioavailability of trace minerals is influenced by a complex matrix of 
interacting variables, including the chemical form of the minerals used and 
those found in the diet, the nature of the food ingested, the total composition 
of the diet, and the health and nutrition of the livestock. Nanominerals such as 
selenium (nano-Se) have shown impressive results when used as animal feed 
supplements in ruminants. Nano-Se can significantly boost wellness and immunity, 
gastrointestinal system function, microbiota homeostasis, metabolism, and 
reproductive performance in ruminants. This review aims to present the current 
knowledge on the technology of nano-Se in ruminants, ranging from the 
nanomanufacturing procedures of nano-Se, the impact of supplementation on the 
ruminant digestive system, productivity, and reproductive performance in 
ruminants in some dosages to find the optimized dosage to be provided.

Appearance of green tea compounds in plasma following acute green tea 
consumption is modulated by the gut microbiome in mice.

Studies have suggested that phytochemicals in green tea have systemic 
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, the mechanisms behind 
these effects are poorly understood, possibly due to differential metabolism of 
phytochemicals resulting from variation in gut microbiome composition. To 
unravel this complex relationship, our team utilized a novel combined microbiome 
analysis and metabolomics approach applied to low complexity microbiome (LCM) 
and human colonized (HU) gnotobiotic mice treated with an acute dose of powdered 
matcha green tea. A total of 20 LCM mice received 10 distinct human fecal 
slurries for an n=2 mice per human gut microbiome; 9 LCM mice remained 
un-colonized with human slurries throughout the experiment. We performed 
untargeted metabolomics on green tea and plasma to identify green tea compounds 
that were found in plasma of LCM and HU mice that had consumed green tea. 16S 
ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on feces of all mice at study end to 
assess microbiome composition. We found multiple green tea compounds in plasma 
associated with microbiome presence and diversity (including acetylagmatine, 
lactiflorin, and aspartic acid negatively associated with diversity). 
Additionally, we detected strong associations between bioactive green tea 
compounds in plasma and specific gut bacteria, including associations between 
spiramycin and Gemmiger , and between wildforlide and Anaerorhabdus . 
Additionally, some of the physiologically relevant green tea compounds are 
likely derived from plant-associated microbes, highlighting the importance of 
considering foods and food products as meta-organisms. Overall, we describe a 
novel workflow for discovering relationships between individual food compounds 
and composition of the gut microbiome.
IMPORTANCE: Foods contain thousands of unique and biologically important 
compounds beyond the macro- and micro-nutrients listed on nutrition facts 
labels. In mammals, many of these compounds are metabolized by the community of 
microbes in the colon. These microbes may impact the thousands of biologically 
important compounds we consume; therefore, understanding microbial metabolism of 
food compounds will be important for understanding how foods impact health. We 
used metabolomics to track green tea compounds in plasma of mice with and 
without complex microbiomes. From this, we can start to recognize certain groups 
of green tea-derived compounds that are impacted by mammalian microbiomes. This 
research presents a novel technique for understanding microbial metabolism of 
food-derived compounds in the gut, which can be applied to other foods.

Resource landscape shapes the composition and stability of the human vaginal 
microbiota.

Kamiya T, Sofonea MT, France M, Tessandier N, Bravo IG, Murall CL, Ravel J, 
Alizon S.

The vaginal microbiota has demonstrated associations with women's and newborns' 
health. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human 
microbiota systems, the ecological processes that underpin the dynamics and 
stability of vaginal microbial communities remain mechanistically elusive. A 
crucial, yet so far under-explored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the 
role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by 
vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the 
microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary 
nutritional resources for bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from 
glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at 
sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and 
are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we 
introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota 
dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective 
nutritional landscapes. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the 
relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial 
species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the 
composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the 
prevalence of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive 
access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies 
communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to 
compositional transitions. We provide empirical support for our model's 
predictions from longitudinal microbiota composition and metabolomic data, 
collected from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study 
shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention.

The human microbial flora is quite diverse and versatile, playing several 
beneficial roles in association with the host and deriving nutrition from it. 
The present study aimed to identify gut microbial flora with potential probiotic 
activities. Eighteen bacterial isolates were screened from ten male individuals 
in this study. Seven bacterial isolates, NCCP-2046, NCCP-2031, NCCP-2035, 
NCCP-2040, NCCP-2041, NCCP-2044, and NCCP-2046, were isolated from the gut 
samples of volunteer men belonging to various areas of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. 
These bacterial isolates were cultured on De Man Rogosa and Sharpe Media (MRS), 
Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA), and Nutrient agar, which showed efficient bacterial 
growth. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of these bacterial 
strains were studied under their optimal growth conditions, along with molecular 
investigations. The antibiotic sensitivity pattern was tested using Kirby-Bauer 
method, which verified the higher MIC against all eight antibiotics used except 
for oxacillin. Phylogenetic analysis of only four bacterial isolates was 
performed based on their 16S rRNA sequences, and their top-hit sequence 
similarities in NCBI and EzBioCloud.net (95-98% and 94%) verified that these 
bacterial candidates belong to the Priestia and Staphylococcus genera. Based on 
molecular evidence through phylogeny and sequence similarities with previously 
defined bacterial candidates, the bacterial strains MG-461621 (NCCP-2031), 
MG-461622 (NCCP-2035), and MG-561934 (NCCP-2046) are presumed to be members of 
Priestia or novel species/genera, while MG-461623 (NCCP-2039) is also found to 
be a previously identified species of Staphylococcus. However, due to decreased 
similarity with the top-hit sequences, it could also be presumed to represent a 
member of a novel genus.

Lentil protein isolate was combined with proteins from oat, rice, brewer's spent 
grain (BSGP) and wheat to achieve plant-based milk alternatives (PBMA) with 
improved protein quality and functionality. Due to the complementary amino acid 
(AA) profile of pulse protein which is high in lysine, and cereal protein which 
is high in sulphur amino acids, their combination at an optimised ratio resulted 
in a protein blend with a significantly improved indispensable amino acid score 
(IAAS) compared to the single ingredients. All protein combinations with lentil 
except for wheat resulted in a full IAAS for adults. The in vitro protein 
digestibility was assessed using the static INFOGEST digestion model to 
calculate the proxy in vitro DIAAS (PIVDIAAS) of the emulsions. 
Techno-functional properties such as particle size, rheological behaviour and 
physical stability were investigated. The PIVDIAAS of the combined protein 
emulsions was found to be 0.72, 0.78, 0.83, 0.98 for lentil + wheat, lentil + 
oat, lentil + BSGP and lentil + rice emulsions, respectively, compared to 0.48, 
0.25, 0.5, 0.67 and 0.81 determined for the emulsions based on lentil, wheat, 
oat, BSGP and rice alone, respectively. The emulsions based on the combination 
of lentil and cereal protein also showed improved physical stability regarding 
sedimentation and creaming, and a higher whiteness index of the emulsions. It 
could be shown that the combination of lentil and cereal protein is a promising 
strategy to achieve PBMAs with improved protein quality and 
techno-functionality.

Recent studies confirmed that host-gut microbiota interactions modulate 
disease-linked metabolite TMA production via TMA lyase. However, microbial 
enzyme production mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we 
investigated the impact of dietary and intervention factors on gut microbiota, 
microbial gene expression, and the interplay between TMA lyase and glycolytic 
pathways in mice. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and 
metabolomics, the gut microbiota composition and microbial functional gene 
expression profiles related to TMA lyase and glycolytic enzymes were determined. 
The results revealed that distinct diets and intervention factors altered gut 
microbiota, gene expression, and metabolites linked to glycine metabolism and 
glycolysis. Notably, an arabinoxylan-rich diet suppressed genes linked to 
choline, glycine, glycolysis, and TMA lyase, favoring glycine utilization via 
pyruvate pathways. Glycolytic inhibitors amplified these effects, mainly 
inhibiting pyruvate kinase. Our findings underscored the crosstalk between TMA 
lyase and glycolytic pathways, regulating glycine levels, and suggested avenues 
for targeted interventions and personalized diets to curb choline TMA lyase 
production.

The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. 
Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice 
hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin 
commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal 
commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize 
the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania 
pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in 
enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune 
surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal 
environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in 
mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined 
that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial 
IL-33 and downstream IL-33-ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. 
Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to 
helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a 
context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse 
commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal 
commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse 
facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental 
outcomes and phenotypes.

The human gut microbiome is highly personal. However, the contribution of gut 
physiology and environment to variations in the gut microbiome remains 
understudied. Here we performed an observational trial using multi-omics to 
profile microbiome composition and metabolism in 61 healthy adults for 9 
consecutive days. We assessed day-to-day changes in gut environmental factors 
and measured whole-gut and segmental intestinal transit time and pH using a 
wireless motility capsule in a subset of 50 individuals. We observed substantial 
daily fluctuations, with intra-individual variations in gut microbiome and 
metabolism associated with changes in stool moisture and faecal pH, and 
inter-individual variations accounted for by whole-gut and segmental transit 
times and pH. Metabolites derived from microbial carbohydrate fermentation 
correlated negatively with the gut passage time and pH, while proteolytic 
metabolites and breath methane showed a positive correlation. Finally, we 
identified associations between segmental transit time/pH and coffee-, diet-, 
host- and microbial-derived metabolites. Our work suggests that gut physiology 
and environment are key to understanding the individuality of the human gut 
microbial composition and metabolism.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a 
significant global health issue, affecting over 30% of the population worldwide 
due to the rising prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This spectrum of liver disease ranges from isolated 
steatosis to more severe forms such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 
Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in MASLD pathogenesis, 
showing that dysbiosis significantly impacts metabolic health and the 
progression of liver disease. This review critically evaluates current 
microbiome-centered therapies in MASLD management, including prebiotics, 
probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and emerging 
therapies such as engineered bacteria and bacteriophage therapy. We explore the 
scientific rationale, clinical evidence, and potential mechanisms by which these 
interventions influence MASLD. The gut-liver axis is crucial in MASLD, with 
notable changes in microbiome composition linked to disease progression. For 
instance, specific microbial profiles and reduced alpha diversity are associated 
with MASLD severity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome could 
modulate disease progression by improving gut permeability, reducing 
endotoxin-producing bacteria, and altering bile acid metabolism. Although 
promising, these therapies require further research to fully understand their 
mechanisms and optimize their efficacy. This review integrates findings from 
clinical trials and experimental studies, providing a comprehensive overview of 
microbiome-centered therapies' potential in managing MASLD. Future research 
should focus on personalized strategies, utilizing microbiome features, blood 
metabolites, and customized dietary interventions to enhance the effectiveness 
of these therapies.

Improving feed efficiency is vital to bolster profitability and sustainability 
in poultry production. Although several studies have established links between 
gut microbiota and feed efficiency, the direct effects remain unclear. In this 
study, two distinct lines of Huiyang bearded chickens, exhibiting significant 
differences in residual feed intake (RFI), were developed after 15 generations 
of selective breeding. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from low RFI 
(LRFI) chickens to high RFI (HRFI) chickens resulted in a reduction trend in 
RFI, decreasing from 5.65 to 4.49 in the HRFI recipient chickens (HFMT). 
Microbiota composition and functional profiles in LRFI and HFMT chickens formed 
a distinct cluster compared to HRFI chickens. Using 16S rDNA sequencing and 
RandomForest analysis, Slackia, Peptococcus, Blautia, and Dorea were identified 
as key microbial markers associated with feed efficiency. Additionally, 
untargeted metabolomics identified common differential metabolites between HFMT 
and LRFI vs. HRFI groups. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations 
between these microbial markers and differential metabolites. These findings 
provide a foundation for microbiome-based strategies to improve feed efficiency 
in poultry.

INTRODUCTION: Both liraglutide and colesevelam improve bile acid diarrhea 
symptoms. Colesevelam binds excess amounts of diarrhea-causing bile acids in the 
colon, whereas the mode of action for liraglutide remains elusive. In this 
article, we examined the impact of colesevelam and liraglutide treatment on the 
concentrations of bile acids in serum and feces and the fecal microbiota 
composition to better understand the 2 drugs' modes of action.
METHODS: Bile acid species were analyzed in serum and fecal samples from a 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks 
of orally administered colesevelam (1,875 mg twice daily, n = 26) or 
subcutaneously administered liraglutide (uptitrated by weekly increments of 0.6 
mg from 0.6 to 1.8 mg daily, n = 26) in patients with 75 
selenium-homotaurocholic acid test-verified, idiopathic, or postcholecystectomy 
bile acid diarrhea. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing at the same time points.
RESULTS: Colesevelam increased the fecal concentrations of all bile acid 
species, whereas it decreased serum concentrations of secondary bile acids. 
Liraglutide induced a small increase in serum unconjugated bile acid 
concentrations without affecting fecal bile acid concentrations. No changes in 
fecal microbiota composition were observed with either treatment.
DISCUSSION: Colesevelam and liraglutide exhibit distinct effects on serum and 
fecal bile acid concentrations with colesevelam reducing serum concentrations of 
secondary bile acids and promoting fecal bile acid excretion, whereas 
liraglutide enhances serum concentrations of unconjugated bile acids, 
potentially through deceleration of small intestinal transit time allowing more 
time for passive absorption of bile acids.

Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract play a crucial role in intestinal 
motility, homeostasis, and dysfunction. Unraveling the mechanisms by which 
microbes impact the host poses many challenges due to the extensive array of 
metabolites produced or metabolized by bacteria in the gut. Here, we describe 
the engineering of a gut commensal bacterium, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, to 
biosynthesize the human metabolite serotonin for examining the effects of 
microbially produced biogenic amines on host physiology. Upon oral 
administration to mice, our engineered bacteria reach the large intestine, where 
they produce serotonin. Mice treated with serotonin-producing bacteria exhibited 
biological changes in the gut at transcriptional and physiological levels. This 
work establishes a novel framework employing engineered bacteria to modulate 
luminal serotonin levels and suggests potential clinical applications of 
modified microbial therapeutics to address gut disorders in humans.

This experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase 
with traces of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase on the performance of 240 piglets 
(Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) with an initial body (BW) of 5.90 ± 0.6 kg. The 
mixed sex piglets were randomly assigned to 3 treatments with 10 replicates per 
treatment, and 8 heads per replicate pen. The dietary treatments include (1) 
corn-wheat-soybean meal (SBM) basal diet without xylanase (XYL) enzyme as 
positive control (PC), (2) corn-wheat-SBM diet deprived -90 kcal/kg 
metabolizable energy without XYL enzyme (NC), and (3) corn-wheat-SBM diet 
deprived -90 kcal/kg metabolizable energy + 0.02 XYL (DG2). The diets were 
administered in mash form for 42 d (split into 2 phases) as phase 1, d 0-21, and 
phase 2, d 22-42. All the experimental diets were designed to fulfil the 
nutrient requirement by NRC 2012. The results show XYL supplementation 
significantly increased (p < 0.05) final body weight and overall average daily 
gain (ADG) while enhancing feed efficiency (G/F) compared to the negative 
control group (NC). Nutrient digestibility was notably improved, with 
significant increases (p < 0.05) in gross energy (GE), xylan, and non-starch 
polysaccharides (NSP) digestibility in both phases. The incorporation of XYL 
also increased monosaccharide and xylooligosaccharide levels in the ileum and 
caecum, indicating enhanced carbohydrate breakdown. Additionally, XYL 
supplementation improved the gut microbiota profile by showing higher tendency 
(p = 0.066) for beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus with a tendency 
(p = 0.052) for lower Escherichia coli counts. Overall, XYL supplementation 
effectively enhanced growth performance and nutrient digestibility in weanling 
pigs on a low-energy diet.

Alcohol intake causes many diseases including neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
nutritional deficiency, progressive pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and ischemic 
heart disease. The gut microbiota changes significantly after alcohol exposure. 
Alcohol consumption tends to increase in underage and young people, but the 
feature of the gut microbiota in puberty remains largely unexplored. In this 
study, we conducted alcohol-exposed pubertal and adult mice model to investigate 
the intestinal damage and gut microbiota change. Interestingly, the responses of 
pubertal mice and adult mice after alcohol exposure were different. We found 
that alcohol dehydrogenase decreased and aldehyde dehydrogenase increased in the 
liver of pubertal mice, thus reducing the accumulation of toxic acetaldehyde. 
Furthermore, alcohol exposure caused less intestinal injury in pubertal mice. 
Through the analysis of metagenome assembly genome, we obtained many 
unrecognized bacterial genomes. Limosillactobacillus reuteri (cluster_56) and 
Lactobacillus intestinalis (cluster_57) were assembled from the samples of 
pubertal mice, which were involved in the production of indole acetic acid and 
the transformation of bile acids in response to alcohol exposure. This study 
provided a new insight to investigate the gut microbiota change and explained 
the difference of the gut microbiota after alcohol exposure between pubertal 
mice and adult mice.
IMPORTANCE: This study elucidates the significant impact of alcohol exposure on 
the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways in mice, highlighting the differential 
responses between adolescent and adult stages. Alcohol exposure was found to 
damage the intestinal barrier, alter the microbial composition by decreasing 
beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus, and increase harmful bacteria such as 
Alistipes. The study also discovered unique microbial changes and resilience in 
pubertal mice. Species-level metagenomic analysis revealed specific microbial 
taxa and metabolic functions affected by alcohol. Metagenome-assembled genomes 
(MAGs) found many species that could not be annotated by conventional methods 
including many members of Lachnospiraceae, greatly expanding our understanding 
of the gut microbiota composition. These findings underscore the need for 
further research on alcohol's effects on various organs and the implications of 
microbial metabolites on disease progression.

Metagenomic research faces a persistent challenge due to the low concordance 
across studies. While matching host confounders can mitigate the impact of 
individual differences, the influence of factors such as genetics, environment, 
and lifestyle habits on microbial profiles makes it exceptionally challenging to 
create fully matched cohorts. The microbial metabolic background, which 
modulates microbial composition, reflects a cumulative impact of host 
confounders, serving as an ideal baseline for microbial sample matching. In this 
study, we introduced miMatch, an innovative metagenomic sample-matching tool 
that uses microbial metabolic background as a comprehensive reference for 
host-related variables and employs propensity score matching to build 
case-control pairs, even in the absence of host confounders. In the simulated 
datasets, miMatch effectively eliminated individual metabolic background 
differences, thereby enhancing the accuracy of identifying differential 
microbial patterns and reducing false positives. Moreover, in real metagenomic 
data, miMatch improved result consistency and model generalizability across 
cohorts of the same disease. A user-friendly web server 
(https://www.biosino.org/iMAC/mimatch) has been established to promote the 
integration of multiple metagenomic cohorts, strengthening causal relationships 
in metagenomic research.

This review explores the critical role of the human microbiome in neurological 
and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on gut-brain axis dysfunction caused 
by dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut bacteria. Dysbiosis has been linked to 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), and stroke. The gut microbiome influences the central nervous 
system (CNS) through signaling molecules, including short-chain fatty acids, 
neurotransmitters, and metabolites, impacting brain health and disease 
progression. Emerging therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), 
have shown promise in restoring microbial balance and alleviating neurological 
symptoms, especially in Alzheimer's and PD. Additionally, nutritional 
interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and specialized diets are being 
investigated for their ability to modify gut microbiota and improve patient 
outcomes. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota 
modulation but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to establish the 
safety and efficacy of these interventions in neurological and mental health 
disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive damage to specific 
neuronal cells, resulting in cognitive impairments. Alzheimer's disease is one 
of the most common types of cognitive impairments. Until recently, strategies 
that prevent its clinical progression have remained elusive. It has been 
suggested that oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and inflammation might 
lead to brain cell death in many neurological disorders. Therefore, the 
identification of effective neuroprotective agents is a research priority, and 
several autophagy-targeted bioactive compounds are promising candidate 
therapeutics for the prevention of brain cell damage. Some Alzheimer's disease 
risk genes expressed within the brain are linked to cholesterol metabolism, 
lipid transport, endocytosis, exocytosis, and/or caveolae formation, suggesting 
fruitful therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments. Among 
them, a well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease is 
allelic variation of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes. APOE proteins may 
regulate aspects of cellular homeostasis, which is perturbed in the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) 
protein is related to autophagy and to the biogenesis of caveolae, endosomes, 
and exosomes, processes which might consequently be involved in the pathogenesis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Recent research 
suggests that modification of the diet and/or gut-microbiota could be effective 
for treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. Collectively, this research 
direction has the potential to improve clinical care through disease-modifying 
treatment strategies with benefits for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disease characterized by an excessively increased 
level of uric acid (UA) in the blood, with an increasing prevalence and often 
associated with kidney damage. Gut microbiota and endotoxins of gut origin are 
key mediators in the gut-kidney axis that can cause renal impairment. The study 
was to reveal the protective effects of fucoidan on renal injury caused by 
hyperuricemia. The hyperuricemia model was established in C57BL/6J mice. After 
10 weeks of fucoidan supplementation, we found that the levels of serum UA and 
creatinine were reduced, and the levels of renal tumor necrosis factor α, 
interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-6, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were also decreased. 
Fucoidan inhibited the expressions of phosphorylated NF-κB p65, NLRP3, and 
activated caspase-1 in the kidneys. Fucoidan also regulated the expressions of 
Bcl-2 family proteins and decreased the activation of caspase-3, thereby 
exerting antiapoptotic effect. In addition, fucoidan could reduce the 
expressions of glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) and urate transporter 1 (URAT1) 
proteins, thereby promoting the excretion of UA from the kidneys. Moreover, the 
protective effect of fucoidan on renal injury may be related to maintaining 
intestinal homeostasis. Fucoidan reduced serum lipopolysaccharide and improved 
the intestinal mucosal barrier function. Fucoidan decreased the abundances of 
Blautia, Muribaculaceae, and Dubosiella, and increased the abundances of 
Lactobacillus. High-dose fucoidan supplementation increased the content of 
butyric acid and enhanced the expression of ATP binding box transporter G2 
(ABCG2) via the AMPK/AKT/CREB pathway in ileum. Conclusion: Fucoidan could 
protect against hyperuricemia-induced renal injury by inhibiting renal 
inflammation and apoptosis and modulating intestinal homeostasis in 
hyperuricemia mice.

Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause 
of visual impairment in the elderly and is characterized by a multifactorial 
etiology. Emerging evidence points to the potential involvement of the 
gut-retina axis in AMD pathogenesis, prompting exploration into novel 
therapeutic strategies. This study aims to investigate the effects of some 
micronutrients (such as lutein and zeaxanthin) and saffron (as a 
supplement)-known for their anti-inflammatory properties-on ophthalmological and 
microbial parameters in neovascular AMD (nAMD) patients. Methods: Thirty naive 
nAMD patients were randomized to receive daily micronutrient supplementation 
alongside anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapy, or anti-VEGF 
treatment alone, over a 6-month period, with comparisons made to a healthy 
control (HC) group (N = 15). Ophthalmological assessments, biochemical 
measurements, and stool samples were obtained before and after treatment. Gut 
microbiota (GM) characterization was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing, while 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), and 
long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were analyzed with a gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry protocol. Results: Compared to HC, nAMD patients exhibited reduced 
GM alpha diversity, altered taxonomic composition, and decreased total SCFA 
levels, in addition to elevated levels of proinflammatory octanoic and nonanoic 
acids. Micronutrient supplementation was associated with improved visual acuity 
relative to the group treated with anti-VEGF alone, along with a decrease in the 
total amount of MCFAs, which are metabolites known to have adverse ocular 
effects. Conclusions: In conclusion, despite certain limitations-such as the 
limited sample size and the low taxonomic resolution of 16S rRNA sequencing-this 
study highlights compositional and functional imbalances in the GM of nAMD 
patients and demonstrates that micronutrient supplementation may help restore 
the gut-retina axis. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of 
micronutrients in enhancing ocular outcomes for nAMD patients, underscoring the 
complex interaction between GM and ocular health.

Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are a group of conditions marked by the 
formation of blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. It occurs 
in all age groups, slightly more often affecting women. Several factors may be 
linked to the development of AIBDs, with nutrition being one of them. The 
literature mentions various food products and food ingredients acting as disease 
modifiers. Given the complex relationship between bullous diseases and 
nutrition, the current literature on AIBDs has been reviewed, with an emphasis 
on the influence of dietary modifications, various diets, and the nutritional 
consequences of these conditions. This review summarizes the role of nutrition 
in the pathogenesis and treatment of the following AIBDs: (i) pemphigus, (ii) 
bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid, (iii) dermatitis 
herpetiformis, and (iv) epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Several nutrients and 
dietary factors have been studied for their potential roles in triggering or 
exacerbating AIBDs. The key nutrients and their potential impacts include thiols 
and bulb vegetables (Allium), phenols, tannic acid, tannins, phycocyanin, 
isothiocyanates, all trans-retinoic acids, cinnamic acid, and walnut antigens. 
Many patients with ABIDs may require supplementation, particularly of vitamin D 
and B3, calcium, potassium, zinc, selenium, and cobalt. In addition, various 
diets play an important role. A soft diet is recommended for individuals with 
issues in the oral cavity and/or esophagus, particularly for those who 
experience difficulties with biting or swallowing. This approach is commonly 
used in managing pemphigus. A high-protein, high-calcium diet, DASH (Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and the Mediterranean diet are utilized during 
long-term glucocorticoid therapy. However, in dermatitis herpetiformis it is 
advisable to follow a gluten-free diet and eliminate iodine from the diet. When 
it comes to herbal supplements, Algae (Spirulina platensis), Echinacea, and St. 
John's wort (Hyperitum perforatum) enhance the ABIDs, while Cassia fistula may 
be recommended in the treatment of erosions in pemphigus vulgaris. Fast foods 
enhance the development of ABIDs. However, the pathomechanism is not yet fully 
understood. Future researchers should more precisely define the relationships 
between nutrients and nutrition and blistering diseases by also looking at, 
i.e., genetic predispositions, microbiome differences, or exposure to stress.

The trillions of microbes that constitute the human gut microbiome play a 
crucial role in digestive health, immune response regulation, and psychological 
wellness. Maintaining gut microbiota is essential as metabolic diseases are 
associated with it. Functional food ingredients potentially improving gut health 
include prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics (PPSPs). While 
probiotics are living bacteria that provide health advantages when ingested 
sufficiently, prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that support good gut 
bacteria. Synbiotics work together to improve immunity and intestinal health by 
combining probiotics and prebiotics. Postbiotics have also demonstrated numerous 
health advantages, such as bioactive molecules created during probiotic 
fermentation. According to a recent study, PPSPs can regulate the synthesis of 
metabolites, improve the integrity of the intestinal barrier, and change the gut 
microbiota composition to control metabolic illnesses. Additionally, the use of 
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) highlights the potential for restoring 
gut health through microbiota modulation, reinforcing the benefits of PPSPs in 
enhancing overall well-being. Research has shown that PPSPs provide several 
health benefits, such as improved immunological function, alleviation of 
symptoms associated with irritable bowel disease (IBD), decreased severity of 
allergies, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite encouraging 
results, many unanswered questions remain about the scope of PPSPs' health 
advantages. Extensive research is required to fully realize the potential of 
these functional food components in enhancing human health and well-being. 
Effective therapeutic and prophylactic measures require further investigation 
into the roles of PPSPs, specifically their immune-system-modulating, 
cholesterol-lowering, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics.

Germany.

Intermittent fasting (IF), including alternate day fasting (ADF) and 
time-restricted feeding (TRF) or, in humans, time-restricted eating (TRE), has 
been associated with the prevention and improvement of diseases, including 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review summarizes 20 animal and human 
studies on the influence of IF on intestinal inflammation. In the animal 
studies, TRF and ADF improved histological scores, inflammatory markers, markers 
of oxidative stress, and microbiota composition. Apart from the studies on 
Ramadan fasting, there are no studies on IF in IBD patients, so human studies on 
IF in healthy people were included. The studies on Ramadan fasting showed almost 
no effects, but this particular type of fasting is not directly comparable to 
TRE or ADF. However, TRE and ADF appear to have anti-inflammatory effects in 
healthy individuals, as they significantly reduce CRP levels and inflammatory 
markers. TRE also improved the composition of microbiota and the circadian 
oscillation of clock genes. The beneficial effects of TRE and ADF in healthy 
people appear to depend on the number of uninterrupted days of fasting, while in 
animal studies improvements in colitis have been observed regardless of the 
duration of fasting.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder with a heterogeneous 
etiology encompassing societal and behavioral risk factors in addition to 
genetic and environmental susceptibility. The cardiovascular consequences of 
diabetes account for more than two-thirds of mortality among people with T2D. 
Not only does T2D shorten life expectancy, but it also lowers quality of life 
and is associated with extremely high health expenditures since diabetic 
complications raise both direct and indirect healthcare costs. An increasing 
body of research indicates a connection between T2D and gut microbial traits, as 
numerous alterations in the intestinal microorganisms have been noted in 
pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals. These include pro-inflammatory bacterial 
patterns, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and 
hyperglycemia-favoring conditions, such as the alteration of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Restoring microbial homeostasis can be very 
beneficial for preventing and co-treating T2D and improving antidiabetic therapy 
outcomes. This review summarizes the characteristics of a "diabetic" microbiota 
and the metabolites produced by microbial species that can worsen or ameliorate 
T2D risk and progression, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted strategies to 
restore eubiosis and regulate blood glucose. Nutritional supplementation, diet, 
and physical exercise are known to play important roles in T2D, and here their 
effects on the gut microbiota are discussed, suggesting non-pharmacological 
approaches that can greatly help in diabetes management and highlighting the 
importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs.

OBJECTIVES: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial was 
conducted to assess the effect of heat-treated Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 
(HT-ES1) in healthy adults with mild to moderate digestive symptoms. A total of 
60 participants were recruited and received either HT-ES1 or an identical 
placebo for 8 weeks with a further follow-up at week 10.
METHODS: This study monitored changes in the total Gastrointestinal Symptom 
Rating Scale for IBS score (GSRS-IBS), Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity 
Scale (IBS-SSS), IBS Quality of Life index (IBS-QoL), gut microbiome using 16S 
rRNA sequencing, and the Visceral Sensitivity Index, as well as a range of 
biochemical markers, anthropometric parameters, and adverse events.
RESULTS: While minimal changes were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, 
the HT-ES1 group showed a significant decrease in total and non-HDL cholesterol 
compared to the placebo. The intervention group also exhibited a significant 
increase in the abundance of the genera Faecalibacterium and Anaerobutyricum, 
both of which were positively correlated with butyrate concentrations. Faecal 
calprotectin significantly increased over time in the placebo group but remained 
stable in the HT-ES1 group.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that HT-ES1 may promote gut health 
by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut, maintaining normal levels 
of faecal calprotectin and reducing serum cholesterol.

Human milk (HM) is a complex biofluid rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds 
essential for infant health. Recent advances in omics technologies-such as 
proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics-have shed light on the influence 
of HM on bone development and health. This review discusses the impact of 
various HM components, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and hormones, 
on bone metabolism and skeletal growth. Proteins like casein and whey promote 
calcium absorption and osteoblast differentiation, supporting bone 
mineralization. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA) contribute to bone health by modulating inflammatory pathways and 
regulating osteoclast activity. Additionally, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) 
act as prebiotics, improving gut health and calcium bioavailability while 
influencing bone mineralization. Hormones present in HM, such as insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), leptin, and adiponectin, have been linked to infant 
growth, body composition, and bone density. Research has shown that higher IGF-1 
levels in breast milk are associated with increased weight gain, while leptin 
and adiponectin influence fat mass and bone metabolism. Emerging studies have 
also highlighted the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating key processes like 
adipogenesis and bone homeostasis. Furthermore, microbiome-focused techniques 
reveal HM's role in establishing a balanced infant gut microbiota, indirectly 
influencing bone development by enhancing nutrient absorption. Although current 
findings are promising, comprehensive longitudinal studies integrating omics 
approaches are needed to fully understand the intricate relationships among 
maternal diet, HM composition, and infant bone health. Bridging these gaps could 
offer novel dietary strategies to optimize skeletal health during infancy, 
advancing early-life nutrition science.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to observe the preventive effect of nicotinamide 
riboside (NR) on fructose-induced lipid metabolism disorders and explore its 
mechanism.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a 20% fructose solution and given 400 mg/kg 
NR daily by gavage for 10 weeks.
RESULTS: The results indicated that NR supplementation significantly reduced the 
body weight, liver weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, serum, and hepatic 
lipid levels. NR upregulated the protein expression levels of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), 
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 
coactiva-tor-1-alpha (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1-encoding gene 
(NRF1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), cluster of differentiation 
137 (CD137), transmembrane protein 26 (TMEM26), and T-box 1 (TBX1). Moreover, NR 
enhanced the Actinobacteria and Enterorhabdus abundance. Spearman's correlation 
analysis revealed that significant correlations exist between Firmicutes, 
Bacteroidetes, and Erysipelotrichaceae with browning-related indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, NR could alleviate lipid metabolic abnormalities 
induced by fructose through activating SIRT1/AMPK-mediated browning of WAT. The 
mechanism by which NR improves fructose-induced lipid metabolism disorders may 
also be associated with the modulation of intestinal flora.

Diseases, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.

BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder that necessitates 
dietary restrictions, potentially impacting the composition of gut and oral 
microbiota. This study aimed to compare the microbiota composition between 
children with PKU and healthy controls.
METHODS: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analysed microbial communities at 
six phylogenetic levels.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota: 
Euryarchaeota was more abundant in controls (p = 0.01), while Bacilli and 
Lactobacillales were higher in PKU children (p = 0.019). Methanobacteriales were 
significantly elevated in controls (p = 0.01). At the genus and species levels, 
PKU children had higher Streptococcus and Eubacterium dolichum (p = 0.019, p = 
0.015), whereas controls had more Barnesiella, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium 
prausnitzii (p = 0.014, p = 0.019, p = 0.014). In the oral microbiota, control 
children exhibited significantly higher Bacteroidetes (p = 0.032), while PKU 
children had increased Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria (p = 0.0079, p = 0.016). 
Streptococcus and Neisseria were more prevalent in PKU (p = 0.0079, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PKU and its dietary management 
significantly alter the gut and oral microbiota composition. Understanding these 
microbial shifts could have implications for managing PKU and improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Frailty increases the risk of needing nursing care and significantly 
affects the life and functional prognosis of older individuals. Early detection 
and tailored interventions are crucial for maintaining and enhancing their life 
functions. Recognizing distinct clinical phenotypes is essential for devising 
appropriate interventions. This study aimed to explore diverse frailty 
phenotypes, focusing on poor nutrition in older Japanese individuals through 
observational research.
METHODS: Twenty-one nursing home residents underwent a comprehensive survey 
covering physical, blood, dietary, cardiac, cognitive, nutritional, nursing 
care, frailty, agitated behavior, and gut microbiome assessments 
(high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing). Using clustering analysis with 239 
survey items (excluding gut microbiome), participants were classified into 
subgroups based on clinical phenotypes, and group characteristics were compared 
through analysis.
RESULTS: Individuals with moderate or severe frailty and suspected dementia 
formed subgroups with distinct clinical phenotypes based on nutritional, 
defecation, and nursing care statuses. The gut microbiome significantly varied 
among these groups (p = 0.007), indicating its correlation with changes in 
clinical phenotype. Nutritional status differences suggested poor nutrition as a 
differentiating factor in the core clinical phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes that the gut microbiome differs based on the 
clinical phenotype of Japanese older individuals with frailty, and targeted 
interventions addressing the gut microbiome may contribute to preventing frailty 
in this population.

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits are crucial for preventing many diseases, 
particularly in children and adolescents. Accurate assessment of dietary intake 
is essential for understanding the relationship between diet and health in these 
age groups.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of a 
Spanish version of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition (EPIC) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in 150 Spanish children and 
adolescents aged 10 to 17 using the average of 9 days of 24-h dietary recall 
(24H-DR) as a reference.
METHODS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to asses 
reproducibility and Spearman/Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to 
assess validity and reproducibility.
RESULTS: The average ICCs were 0.41 for crude nutrients, 0.31 for food groups, 
0.31 for energy-adjusted nutrients, and 0.4 for energy-adjusted food groups. 
Spearman/Pearson correlation coefficients averaged 0.39 and 0.41 for crude and 
energy-adjusted nutrients, respectively, and 0.51 and 0.47 for corresponding 
food groups. Regarding validity, the average correlation coefficient for crude, 
energy-adjusted, and de-attenuated nutrients was 0.32, 0.50, and 0.50, 
respectively. The highest crude coefficient was 0.50 for vitamin C and fiber, 
while the highest energy-adjusted coefficient was 0.76 for protein and 
carbohydrates. The highest de-attenuated coefficient was 0.72 for vitamin B6.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the EPIC FFQ is a valid and 
reliable instrument for assessing dietary intake in Spanish children and 
adolescents.

Recent studies have shown a growing interest in the complex relationship between 
the human gut microbiota, metabolism, and overall health. This review aims to 
explore the gut microbiota-host association, focusing on its implications for 
precision nutrition and personalized medicine. The objective is to highlight how 
gut microbiota modulate metabolic and immune functions, contributing to disease 
susceptibility and wellbeing. The review synthesizes recent research findings, 
analyzing key studies on the influence of gut microbiota on lipid and 
carbohydrate metabolism, intestinal health, neurobehavioral regulation, and 
endocrine signaling. Data were drawn from both experimental and clinical trials 
examining microbiota-host interactions relevant to precision nutrition. Our 
findings highlight the essential role of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in 
regulating host metabolism, including lipid and glucose pathways. These 
metabolites have been found to influence immune responses and gut barrier 
integrity. Additionally, the microbiota impacts broader physiological processes, 
including neuroendocrine regulation, which could be crucial for dietary 
interventions. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of 
dietary-microbiota-host interactions is pivotal for advancing personalized 
nutrition strategies. Tailored dietary recommendations based on individual gut 
microbiota compositions hold promise for improving health outcomes, potentially 
revolutionizing future healthcare approaches across diverse populations.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nutritional deficiencies have been proposed as possible 
etiological causes for autoimmune diseases, among which type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
Vitamin K (VK) has potentially positive effects on type 2 diabetes, but its role 
on T1D in humans remains largely unknown. We aimed to examine the presence of a 
causal association between VK and T1D using a Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach.
METHODS: Genetic variants from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for VK (N 
= 2138 Europeans) were used as instruments in our two-sample MR study to 
investigate whether circulating VK levels are causally associated with the risk 
of T1D in a large European T1D GWAS cohort (18,942 cases/520,580 controls). 
Through a multivariable MR (MVMR), the effects of both VK and specific gut 
microbiota on T1D were investigated given that the gut microbiome synthesizes 
VK.
RESULTS: We found that changes in levels of circulating VK did not affect T1D 
risk in our univariate two-sample MR, but this study had limited power to detect 
small effects of VK (OR for T1D of less than 0.8). However, our MVMR indicated a 
suggestive association of VK with the risk of T1D adjusting for two different 
gut microbiome populations.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, VK levels are unlikely to significantly affect the 
risk of T1D, but small effects cannot be excluded, and the role of gut 
microbiome in this association should be further investigated.

This case report examines the correlation between hydration, weight variation, 
and perceived effort in a 43-year-old amateur athlete during a self-supported 
81.5 km crossing of Death Valley, completed over 3 days with significant 
elevation changes. Studies have shown that a body mass loss greater than 2-3% 
can lead to an increased perception of effort and a decline in performance. 
Specifically, during passive and active heat exposures, the average body mass 
loss was found to be 1.4 ± 0.3% and 4.1 ± 0.7%, respectively. Salivary 
osmolarity has demonstrated a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 91% in 
diagnosing dehydration of ≥ 2%, suggesting its potential as a non-invasive 
indicator of hydration status. The subject monitored their own body weight, 
hydration (via salivary osmolarity), and perceived effort using a rate of 
perceived exertion (RPE) scale. Nutritional intake included isocaloric meals and 
nutritional bars, and hydration was managed using water and a hydroelectrolytic 
solution. Key bioimpedance parameters were measured to assess body composition 
and hydration status. A progressive decrease in body weight correlated with an 
increase in perceived effort (RPE score) and salivary osmolarity. Resistance 
(Rx) remained stable, while reactance (Xc) showed a biphasic trend and was 
inversely correlated with the sodium/potassium ratio (NAK). There were 
significant linear correlations between perceived effort and both weight loss 
and salivary osmolarity, indicating that salivary osmolarity is a potential 
early predictor of these changes. The findings highlight a linear correlation 
between weight loss, perceived effort, and salivary osmolarity, suggesting that 
monitoring salivary osmolarity would be useful for the field assessment of 
hydration and exertion. Further research with larger populations is necessary to 
validate these observations.

Dietary patterns have been shown to worsen or alleviate several dermatological 
diseases. A well-balanced, plant-based diet is known to have anti-inflammatory, 
probiotic, and antioxidant properties, along with weight loss-promoting effects. 
Moreover, a plant-based diet has a low glycemic load, improving metabolic 
disease. Due to these qualities, plant-based diets may have beneficial effects 
on inflammatory skin conditions. In this review, we aim to discuss the possible 
mechanisms by which a plant-based diet reduces disease severity in psoriasis, 
acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, and atopic dermatitis. We also aim to clarify 
how a plant-based diet may influence skin healing and identify sources of 
vitamins, nutrients, fatty acids, and protein in a well-balanced, plant-based 
diet. We performed a literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE databases with the 
following keywords: "plant-based" OR "vegan" OR "vegetarian" OR "meat" OR "diet" 
AND "psoriasis" OR "hidradenitis suppurativa" OR "acne" OR "atopic dermatitis" 
OR "skin healing" OR "dermatology". Our findings demonstrate that plant-based 
foods may improve inflammatory skin diseases by supporting the gut microbiome, 
exerting anti-inflammatory effects, providing barrier support, and improving 
glycemic control. With the proper education, there is an abundance of 
plant-based food sources or supplements that contain riboflavin, vitamin B12, 
vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein, thereby ameliorating the risk of 
nutritional deficiencies. Thus, a plant-based diet may have therapeutic 
potential in dermatology. In spite of the evidence available, there is a paucity 
of clinical studies focusing specifically on plant-based diets and dermatologic 
conditions and further investigation is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Small bowel dysbiosis (SBD) is a frequent finding in subjects with 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The sunflower lecithin (phytosome) formulation 
of Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata demonstrated beneficial effects on 
intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 
lecithin-based delivery formulation of Curcuma longa and Boswellia serrata 
extracts (CUBO) on SBD in IBS subjects.
SUBJECTS: Forty-nine adult subjects with IBS and SBD were randomly supplemented 
for 30 days with CUBO and a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) (intervention) or with LFD and 
placebo (control group).
RESULTS: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in urinary 
indican (p < 0.001), which was the marker of SBD, and of abdominal bloating (p < 
0.001) and abdominal pain (p < 0.001). The pre-post control group analysis did 
not evidence significant differences. The comparison between the two groups (net 
effect in intervention minus control subjects) showed that the changes differ 
significantly for urinary indican p < 0.001 (-42.88; 95% CI: -62.04 to -23.72), 
abdominal bloating p < 0.001 (-1.50; 95% CI: -1.93 to -1.07), and abdominal pain 
p < 0.001 (-2.37; 95% CI: -3.61 to -1.13) and for the global assessment of 
efficacy (p < 0.001). The efficacy was 20% greater in males than in females.
CONCLUSIONS: In IBS subjects, the intervention with CUBO and LFD shows a 
significantly higher reduction in SBD, abdominal pain, and bloating compared to 
LFD and placebo. Additional research is needed to confirm these data.

Red beetroots, rich in betanin, may act as prebiotics and impact gut microbiota. 
Because the human gut microbiota is unique to each person, the effectiveness of 
prebiotics varies with the enterotype. In this study, we hypothesized that the 
effects of red beetroot powder (RP) and betanin pigment (BP) would differ 
depending on the enterotype. Fecal samples from 30 subjects were analyzed and 
categorized into three enterotypes: Phocaeicola, Prevotella, and 
Bifidobacterium. Feces were collected from one representative subject from each 
enterotype cluster for fermentation. Results showed that RP and BP affected 
microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production differently 
across enterotypes. The Bifidobacterium cluster showed significantly reduced 
alpha diversity, with the direction of change in the gut microbiota composition 
being different from that of other subjects. Additionally, SCFAs significantly 
increased, with the highest increase in the Bifidobacterium cluster. In this 
cluster, metabolic pathways related to SCFAs (i.e., starch and sucrose 
metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) were altered. Conversely, 
Prevotella-dominant feces exhibited fewer changes in SCFAs and a lower increase 
in Bifidobacterium abundance than the others. These findings highlight that RP 
and BP elicit enterotype-specific responses in the gut microbiota composition 
and SCFA production, emphasizing the importance of enterotypes in personalized 
nutrition.

Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a metabolite derived from microbial tryptophan 
metabolism, plays a crucial role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. However, 
the influence and potential applications of IAA in the context of animal 
pathogen infections remain underexplored. This study investigates the 
prophylactic effects of IAA pretreatment against Salmonella typhimurium (ST) 
SL1344 infection, focusing on its ability to attenuate inflammatory responses, 
enhance intestinal barrier integrity, inhibit bacterial colonization, and 
restore colonic microbiota dysbiosis. The results demonstrated that IAA 
ameliorated the clinical symptoms in mice, as evidenced by reduced weight loss 
and histopathological damage. Furthermore, IAA inhibited the inflammatory 
response by downregulating the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in colon, ileum, and liver. IAA also preserved 
the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted the expression of 
tight junction proteins. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed 
significant alterations in intestinal microbiota structure induced by ST 
infection following IAA treatment. Notable changes in β diversity and species 
richness were characterized by the enrichment of beneficial bacteria including 
Bacteroideaceae, Spirillaceae, and Bacillus. The proliferation of Salmonella 
enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi was significantly inhibited, thereby 
enhancing the intestinal health of the host. In summary, the oral administration 
of IAA contributes to the alleviation of inflammation, restoration of the 
intestinal barrier, and correction of colonic microbiota disturbance in mice 
challenged with ST.

Recent studies suggested an association between the reproductive performance of 
sows and their gut microbiota. To understand how the gut microbiota affect the 
reproductive performances of sows, we conducted a whole-genome metagenomic 
analysis on the fecal microbial functional profiles of sows with high and low 
reproductive performances. We used 60 sows from six farms (10 sows/farm), 
including 30 sows from three farms with higher reproductive performances (the 
mean number of weaned piglets/sow/year) (group H) and 30 sows from three farms 
with lower performances (group L). Fecal microbial DNA was subjected to a 
whole-genome metagenomic analysis. Biomarker exploration analysis identified 
"carbohydrate transport and metabolism" as the most discriminative function 
enriched in group H. Further analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes revealed 
that the fecal microbiome of group H had a greater capacity to degrade dietary 
fiber, specifically cellulose and pectin. Group H also exhibited higher fecal 
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations than group L, with the abundances 
of cellulose- and pectin-degrading genes showing significant positive 
correlations with fecal SCFA concentrations. Taxonomic analysis indicated 
greater contributions of Prevotella, Treponema, Ruminococcus, and Fibrobacter to 
cellulose and pectin degradation in the fecal microbiome in group H. In 
conclusion, higher reproductive performances of sows were, at least in part, 
associated with a greater microbial capacity for degrading cellulose and pectin, 
resulting in a higher SCFA production in the hindgut.

With the continuous optimization of feed ingredients in livestock production, 
barley has garnered significant attention as a potential substitute for corn in 
feed. This study aims to investigate the effects of replacing part of the corn 
and soybean meal with barley, wheat bran, and rapeseed meal on Wenshan cattle, 
focusing on the rumen microbial community, blood physiological and biochemical 
indicators, and growth traits. Through an intensive feeding experiment with two 
different dietary ratios, we found that adding barley to the diet significantly 
reduced the host's blood lipid concentration and significantly increased the 
height, body length, heart girth, and average daily weight gain of Wenshan 
cattle. Analysis of the rumen microbial community structure showed that the 
addition of barley significantly affected the relative abundance of Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, with the relative abundance of Spirochaetes 
being significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The 
dominant bacterial groups mainly included Acinetobacter, Solibacillus, and 
Lysinibacillus. In summary, this study reveals the potential of different feed 
ingredient ratios involving barley, wheat bran, and rapeseed meal in the 
production performance of Wenshan cattle. By regulating blood physiology and 
improving the rumen micro-ecological structure, it provides new scientific 
evidence for optimizing livestock and poultry feeding management strategies. 
Future research will further explore the optimal application ratio of barley 
under different feeding conditions and its long-term impact on animal health and 
production performance.

Maternal gut and breast milk (BM) are key in vertically transmission bacteria to 
infants, shaping their gut microbiota in early life. Although the establishment 
of early gut microbiota is known, the role of the combined influence of maternal 
factors and newborn characteristics is not explored. In this study, we aimed to 
assess the influence of maternal BMI and total body fat, age, delivery mode, and 
newborn sex on the diversity and composition of the BM and gut microbiota (GM) 
in mother-newborn dyads. In this cross-sectional study, of the 986 pregnant 
women candidates, 53 participated, and, finally, 40 mother-newborn dyads 
exclusively breastfeeding at 20-28 days postpartum were included. Metataxonomic 
profiling of DNA extracted from BM and fecal samples was conducted using 16S 
rRNA sequencing. Globally, the findings offer valuable insights that excessive 
adiposity, age, and C-section delivery influence a lower abundance of specific 
taxa in the BM, maternal gut, and gut of newborns. Also, the simultaneous 
analysis of maternal factors and newborn characteristics shows that maternal age 
and newborn sex explain an important variation in the microbiota composition. 
These results add to the understanding of the intricate interplay between 
maternal factors and the microbial communities that influence early-life gut and 
BM microbiota.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) represents the most prevalent disorder of 
brain-gut interaction, affecting approximately 10% of the global population. The 
objective of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which the gut 
microbiota contributes to the development of IBS. To this end, a review of 
articles that examined the gut microbiota of IBS patients was conducted. A 
search was conducted using PubMed and J-STAGE for articles published over the 
past five years that relate to the gut microbiota in patients with IBS. 
Individuals diagnosed with IBS display a reduction in alpha diversity and a 
decline in butyrate-producing bacteria, which collectively indicate a state of 
dysbiosis within their gut microbiota. Butyrate plays a dual role in the body, 
acting as a source of nutrition for the intestinal epithelium while also 
regulating the expression of dopamine transporters and D2 receptors in the 
central nervous system through epigenetic mechanisms. These characteristics may 
be linked to dysfunction of the central dopamine D2 pathway and play a role in 
the formation of various symptoms in IBS.

Our study was designed to investigate the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 1008 
(LP1008) on testicular antioxidant capacity, spermatogenesis, apoptosis, 
autophagy, and metabolic function in male mice with high-fat-diet-induced 
obesity. A total of thirty-six male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (denoted 
as the NC group) or a high-fat control diet (denoted as the HFC group) for 16 
weeks, then half of the HFC group was randomly chosen and subsequently fed with 
LP1008 for the final 8 weeks (high-fat diet + LP1008; denoted as the HFP group). 
The HFP group expressed improved blood cholesterol, insulin resistance, hepatic 
function, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels compared to the HFC group. 
Meanwhile, the HFC group displayed decreased testicular testosterone levels, 
sperm quality, and 17β-HSD protein expression, which were rescued after LP1008 
treatment. Moreover, the HFC group had lower superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) enzyme activities. After LP1008 
treatment, enhanced antioxidative activities and decreased lipid peroxidation 
were observed. The HFC group also exhibited aggravated apoptosis, inflammation, 
and autophagy proteins in the testis, which were ameliorated by LP1008 
supplementation. Furthermore, the gut microbiota analysis results revealed that 
the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly elevated in the HFC and HFP 
groups compared to the NC group and that LP1008 treatment diminished 
Ruminococcaceae and enhanced Bifidobacteriaceae diversity. In summary, LP1008 
treatment strengthened antioxidative enzyme levels and regulated 
microbiota-ameliorated HFC-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, 
and autophagy, and thus improved testicular function and semen quality.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common mycotoxin observed in cereal grains, and feed 
contamination poses health risks to pigs. Biological antidotes, such as 
synbiotics (SYNs), have garnered attention for mitigating DON toxicity. This 
study aimed to assess the efficacy of SYNs by comparing the blood biochemistry, 
histology, and gut microbiome of weaned piglets. A 4-week trial was conducted on 
32 weaned piglets. After a week of diet and environmental adaptation, the pigs 
were divided into four groups: (1) control (CON, n = 8); (2) SYN (n = 8); (3) 
DON (n = 8); and (4) DON+SYN (n = 8). The SYN supplementation of weaned piglets 
increased the final body weight (21.71 ± 0.93 vs. 20.73 ± 0.84), average daily 
gain (0.38 ± 0.02 vs. 0.34 ± 0.02), and gain-to-feed ratio (0.49 ± 0.04 vs. 0.43 
± 0.02), and decreased the feed conversion ratio (2.14 ± 0.14 vs. 2.39 ± 0.13) 
compared to the DON group. A high dose of DON induced liver and colon fibrosis 
and liver and cecum apoptosis, which were alleviated by SYNs. Glucose in the DON 
group (84.9 ± 3.7) was significantly lower than in the control (101.3 ± 4.2). 
Additionally, both the DON and DON+SYN groups exhibited higher creatine (0.9 ± 
0.0 and 0.9 ± 0.1) and lower cholesterol (88.3 ± 3.2 and 90.0 ± 4.8) levels (p < 
0.05). In conclusion, SYNs alleviated DON toxicity, indicating its potential as 
an antidote for specific biomarkers.

The contribution of nutritional factors to disease development has been 
demonstrated for several chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
metabolic syndrome, and about 30 percent of cancers. Nutrients include 
macronutrients and micronutrients, which are required in large and trace 
quantities, respectively. Macronutrients, which include protein, carbohydrates, 
and lipids, are mainly involved in energy production and biomolecule synthesis; 
micronutrients include vitamins and minerals, which are mainly involved in 
immune functions, enzymatic reactions, blood clotting, and gene transcription. 
Among the numerous micronutrients potentially involved in disease development, 
the present review will focus on iron and its relation to tumor development. 
Recent advances in the understanding of iron-related proteins accumulating in 
the tumor microenvironment shed light on the pivotal role of iron availability 
in sustaining pathological tumor hallmarks, including cell cycle regulation, 
angiogenesis, and metastasis.

The circadian clock gene system plays a pivotal role in coordinating the daily 
rhythms of most metabolic processes. It is synchronized with the light-dark 
cycle and the eating-fasting schedule. Notably, the interaction between meal 
timing and circadian clock genes (CGs) allows for optimizing metabolic processes 
at specific times of the day. Breakfast has a powerful resetting effect on the 
CG network. A misaligned meal pattern, such as skipping breakfast, can lead to a 
discordance between meal timing and the endogenous CGs, and is associated with 
obesity and T2D. Conversely, concentrating most calories and carbohydrates (CH) 
in the early hours of the day upregulates metabolic CG expression, thus 
promoting improved weight loss and glycemic control. Recently, it was revealed 
that microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut microbiome 
(GM), and its derived metabolites display daily oscillation, and play a critical 
role in energy and glucose metabolism. The timing of meal intake coordinates the 
oscillation of GM and GM-derived metabolites, which in turn influences CG 
expression, playing a crucial role in the metabolic response to food intake. An 
imbalance in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) can also reciprocally disrupt CG 
rhythms. Evidence suggests that misaligned meal timing may cause such 
disruptions and can lead to obesity and hyperglycemia. This manuscript focuses 
on the reciprocal interaction between meal timing, GM oscillation, and circadian 
CG rhythms. It will also review studies demonstrating how aligning meal timing 
with the circadian clock can reset and synchronize CG rhythms and GM 
oscillations. This synchronization can facilitate weight loss and improve 
glycemic control in obesity and those with T2D.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global morbidity and 
mortality. Recent advancements in high-throughput omics techniques have enhanced 
our understanding of the human microbiome's role in the development of CVDs. 
Although the relationship between the gut microbiome and CVDs has attracted 
considerable research attention and has been rapidly evolving in recent years, 
the role of the oral microbiome remains less understood, with most prior studies 
focusing on periodontitis-related pathogens. In this review, we summarized 
previously reported associations between the oral microbiome and CVD, 
highlighting known CVD-associated taxa such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. We also 
discussed the interactions between the oral and gut microbes. The potential 
mechanisms by which the oral microbiota can influence CVD development include 
oral and systemic inflammation, immune responses, cytokine release, 
translocation of oral bacteria into the bloodstream, and the impact of 
microbial-related products such as microbial metabolites (e.g., short-chain 
fatty acids [SCFAs], trimethylamine oxide [TMAO], hydrogen sulfide [H2S], nitric 
oxide [NO]) and specific toxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS], leukotoxin 
[LtxA]). The processes driven by these mechanisms may contribute to 
atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and other cardiovascular pathologies. 
Integrated multi-omics methodologies, along with large-scale longitudinal 
population studies and intervention studies, will facilitate a deeper 
understanding of the metabolic and functional roles of the oral microbiome in 
cardiovascular health. This fundamental knowledge will support the development 
of targeted interventions and effective therapies to prevent or reduce the 
progression from cardiovascular risk to clinical CVD events.

Large-scale intensive feeding triggered reduced growth performance and 
nutritional value. Exogenous probiotics can promote the growth performance and 
nutritional value of fish through improving the intestinal microbiota. However, 
detailed research on the correlation between the intestinal microbiota, growth 
performance, and nutritional value remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we 
performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis to investigate the effects of 
probiotic addition to basal diet (1.0 × 108 CFU/g) (PF) and water (1.0 × 108 
CFU/g) (PW) on the growth performance, muscle nutritional value, intestinal 
microbiota and their metabolites, and glucolipid metabolism in Coilia nasus. The 
results showed that FBW, BL, and SGR were enhanced in PF and PW groups. The 
concentrations of EAAs, TAAs, SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs were increased in PF and PW 
groups. Metagenomic and metabolic analyses revealed that bacterial community 
structure and metabolism were changed in the PF and PW groups. Moreover, adding 
probiotics to diet and water increased SCFAs and bile acids in the intestine. 
The gene expression associated with lipolysis and oxidation (hsl, pparα, cpt1, 
and acadm) and glycolysis (gck and pfk) was upregulated, while the gene 
expression associated with lipid synthesis (srebp1, acc, dgat, and elovl6) and 
gluconeogenesis (g6pca1, g6pca2, and pck) was downregulated in the liver. 
Correlation analysis displayed that hepatic glucolipid metabolism was regulated 
through the microbiota-gut-liver axis. Mantel test analysis showed that growth 
performance and muscle nutritional value were improved by the gut-liver axis. 
Our findings offered novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie the 
enhancement of growth performance and nutritional value in C. nasus and other 
fish by adding probiotics.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious condition characterized by new-onset hypertension 
and proteinuria or organ dysfunction after the 20th week of gestation, making it 
a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality worldwide. Despite extensive 
research, significant gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms underlying PE, 
contributing to the ineffectiveness of current prevention and treatment 
strategies. Consequently, premature cesarean sections often become the primary 
intervention to safeguard maternal and fetal health. Emerging evidence indicates 
that placental insufficiency, driven by molecular disturbances, plays a central 
role in the development of PE. Additionally, the maternal microbiome may be 
implicated in the pathomechanism of preeclampsia by secreting metabolites that 
influence maternal inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby affecting 
placental health. Given the limitations of pharmaceuticals during pregnancy due 
to potential risks to fetal development and concerns about teratogenic effects, 
nutraceuticals may provide safer alternatives. Nutraceuticals are food products 
or dietary supplements that offer health benefits beyond basic nutrition, 
including plant extracts or probiotics. Their historical use in traditional 
medicine has provided valuable insights into their safety and efficacy, 
including for pregnant women. This review will examine how the adoption of 
nutraceuticals can enhance dysregulated placental pathways, potentially offering 
benefits in the prevention and treatment of preeclampsia.

The hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway plays a key role in both embryonic and 
postnatal development of the intestine and is responsible for gut homeostasis. 
It regulates stem cell renewal, formation of the villous-crypt axis, 
differentiation of goblet and Paneth cells, the cell cycle, apoptosis, 
development of gut innervation, and lipid metabolism. Ligands of the Hh pathway, 
i.e., Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh), are expressed by 
superficial enterocytes but act in the mesenchyme, where they are bound by a 
Patched receptor localised on myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. This 
activates a cascade leading to the transcription of target genes, including 
those encoding G1/S-specific cyclin-D2 and -E1, B-cell lymphoma 2, fibroblast 
growth factor 4, and bone morphogenetic protein 4. The Hh pathway is tightly 
connected to Wnt signalling. Ihh is the major ligand in the Hh pathway. Its 
activation inhibits proliferation, while its blocking induces hyperproliferation 
and triggers a wound-healing response. Thus, Ihh is a negative feedback 
regulator of cell proliferation. There are data indicating that diet composition 
may affect the expression of the Hh pathway genes and proteins, which in turn, 
induces changes in mucosal architecture. This was shown for fat, vitamin A, 
haem, berberine, and ovotransferrin. The Hh signalling is also affected by the 
intestinal microbiota, which affects the intestinal barrier integrity. This 
review highlights the critical importance of the Hh pathway in shaping the 
intestinal mucosa and summarises the results obtained so far in research on the 
effect of dietary constituents on the activity of this pathway.

The intestinal microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), with its composition varying based on geographic location 
and dietary factors. This study was performed to examine and compare the 
bacterial composition of the gut microbiota in Mexican and Spanish individuals 
with IBD and healthy controls, while also considering the nutritional aspects. 
This study involved 79 individuals with IBD and healthy controls from Mexico and 
Spain. The fecal microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing, and the dietary intake and anthropometric measurements were 
collected. Alpha diversity analysis revealed a lower Chao1 index of the 
bacterial genera in the IBD groups. Beta diversity analysis showed significant 
differences in the bacterial composition, suggesting inter-individual 
variability within the healthy and IBD groups. Additionally, the relative 
abundance of the bacterial genera varied across the four groups. 
Faecalibacterium was more abundant in the IBD groups; Prevotella was found 
exclusively in the Mexican groups, and Akkermansia was found only in the Spanish 
groups. Akkermansia was positively correlated with meat and protein intake, 
Prevotella with lean mass, and Bacteroides with calorie intake. These findings 
highlight the importance of considering geographic and nutritional factors in 
future research on the gut microbiome's role in IBD pathogenesis.

Physical activity highly impacts the neuroendocrine system and hormonal 
secretion. Numerous variables, both those related to the individual, including 
genetics, age, sex, biological rhythms, nutritional status, level of training, 
intake of drugs or supplements, and previous or current pathologies, and those 
related to the physical activity in terms of type, intensity, and duration of 
exercise, or environmental conditions can shape the hormonal response to 
physical exercise. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the 
effects of physical exercise on hormonal levels in the human body, focusing on 
changes in concentrations of hormones such as cortisol, testosterone, and 
insulin in response to different types and intensities of physical activity. 
Regular monitoring of hormonal responses in athletes could be a potential tool 
to design individual training programs and prevent overtraining syndrome.

To evaluate the impact of different roughages on the intestinal microbiota of 
yak calves, we fed them oat hay in substitution of alfalfa hay, in addition to 
milk replacer and starter powder. Twenty-one 45-day-old male yak calves were 
selected and randomly assigned to three groups: the milk replacer + starter + 
alfalfa hay group (AH), the milk replacer + starter + oat hay group (OH), and 
the milk replacer + starter + mixed hay group (AO), in which the alfalfa hay and 
oat hay were administered in a 1:1 ratio. All calves in the three groups were 
fed the same milk replacer and an equivalent amount of dry matter. The formal 
experiment commenced after a 21-day pre-test period and lasted for 120 days. 
Following the experiment, the contents of the jejunum and colon were collected 
to investigate the intestinal microbiota and metabolites using 16S rRNA 
sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics. The result showed that the AO group had 
greater final body weights overall than the AH group and OH group (p < 0.05). 
The AH group and OH group had considerably greater feed-to-gain ratios than the 
AO group (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, the OH group exhibited an increased 
relative abundance of Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota in the jejunum (p < 0.05). 
The relative abundance of Actinobacteriota in the colon was increased in the AO 
group (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the AO group exhibited a decreased 
abundance of Clostridium sensu_stricto_1 (p < 0.05), and the OH group showed an 
increased abundance UCG-005 and Alistipes in the jejunum. There were many 
differential metabolites in the OH group and AO group compared to the AH group, 
and the different metabolites of the OH group were associated with the metabolic 
pathways of the nervous system, sensory system, amino acid metabolism, and lipid 
metabolism in the jejunum and with lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and 
the nervous system in the colon. In the AO group, these metabolites were 
associated with the digestive system and the translation and metabolism of 
cofactors in the jejunum and with the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in 
the colon. In summary, it is feasible to replace alfalfa hay with oat hay based 
on milk replacer and starter. The combination of the two forages enhanced 
nutrient absorption, improved immune function, maintained the internal 
homeostasis of yak calves, and was more beneficial to their growth and 
development.

Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens, BSF) is farmed worldwide to convert 
organic waste into usable biomaterials. Studies on the larval microbiome have 
been carried out to check for symbiotic or pathogenic microbes and their 
respective functions and fates. Some studies tested these microbes for 
industrial applications, while others tested the effects of exogenous microbes 
as probiotics or for substrate pre-processing to improve larval fitness, 
bioconversion rates, or nutritional qualities. This review examined all 
peer-reviewed literature on these topics to consolidate many disparate findings 
together. It followed the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews. The results 
found no evidence of globally conserved core microbes, as diet strongly 
correlated with gut microbiome, but some genera appeared most frequently in BSF 
larval guts worldwide regardless of diet. The gut microbes undoubtably assist in 
digestion, including pathogen suppression, and so microbial probiotics show 
promise for future investigations. However, the common gut microbes have not 
been explored as probiotics themselves, which would be a promising direction for 
future work. The impacts of BSF bioconversion on pathogens varied, so each 
rearing facility should investigate and manage their pathogen risks 
independently. The data summarized in this study provide useful reference points 
for future investigations into BSF-microbe interactions.

The nonprotein amino acid γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can enhance intestinal 
function in piglets; however, the mechanisms involved are not yet fully 
understood. To explore the effects of GABA and its underlying mechanisms, 
weanling piglets were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving either a 
basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with GABA (80 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg). The 
results demonstrated that dietary GABA improved growth performance and reduced 
diarrhea incidence (p < 0.05). Additionally, GABA supplementation decreased the 
serum and intestinal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05), and 
improved intestinal morphology. Multi-omics analyses were employed to explore 
the alterations caused by GABA supplementation and elucidate the related 
mechanisms. Microbiota profiling revealed improved beta-diversity and changes in 
the composition of ileal bacteria and fungi. Amino acid metabolism, lipid 
metabolism, and digestive processes were primarily enriched in the GABA group 
according to metabolomics analysis. A transcriptome analysis showed significant 
enrichment in ion transmembrane transport and nutrition absorption and digestion 
pathways in the ileum. Furthermore, increased lipase and trypsin activity, along 
with the elevated expression of tight junction proteins confirmed the beneficial 
effects of GABA on intestinal nutrient metabolism and barrier function. In 
conclusion, dietary 80 mg/kg GABA supplementation improved nutrient digestion 
and absorption and intestinal function in weanling piglets.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary fiber (DF) levels and 
copper concentrations on the production performance and cecal microbial 
diversity of finishing pigs. A 2 × 2 factorial experimental design was used, 
with different levels of dietary fiber (low [23% DF]: L and high [30% DF]: H) 
and copper concentrations (normal [25 mg/kg]: N and supplemented [45 mg/kg]: S) 
resulting in four diets (LN, LS, HN, and HS). Forty-eight hybrid barrows (Duroc 
× Landrace × Yorkshire), with an initial body weight of 76 kg ± 1.5 kg, were 
randomly assigned to four groups: LN, LS, HN, and HS, with 12 replicates per 
group and one pig per replicate. There was a 7-day adaptation period followed by 
a 56-day feeding trial, after which all pigs were slaughtered for sampling. 
Results indicated that in finishing pigs, the low dietary fiber group exhibited 
a higher final weight, a higher average daily gain, and a lower feed-to-gain 
ratio compared to the high fiber group (p < 0.05). The LS group showed higher 
digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, ash, neutral detergent 
fiber, and DF than the HN and HS groups (p < 0.05). Blood total protein levels 
were higher in the high fiber group, whereas blood Cu levels were higher in the 
supplemented copper group (p < 0.05). High dietary fiber increased the 
activities of colonic carboxymethylcellulase and β-glucanase (p < 0.05). 
Concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and total volatile fatty acids 
were elevated in the high fiber group (p < 0.05). Microbial α-diversity indices 
(observed species, Chao 1, and Shannon indices) increased with fiber but 
decreased with copper supplementation (p < 0.05). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes 
ratio increased with fiber levels, with a higher relative abundance of 
Lactobacillus in the LS group. In conclusion, appropriate copper supplementation 
in diets can mitigate the negative effects of high fiber levels on finishing pig 
production performance by enhancing nutrient digestibility, fiber-degrading 
enzyme activity, regulating the microbial community, and its metabolic products.

Background. In many studies over the past decade, scientists have made a 
connection between the composition of gut microbiota and human health. A number 
of publications have shown that gut bacteria are involved in many metabolic and 
physiological processes of the organism. The composition of the gut microbiome 
is unique for each person and is formed under the influence of various factors 
associated with both the individual characteristics of the body and the 
characteristics of the environment. Different regional characteristics make it 
necessary for the body to adapt to certain conditions, including temperature 
fluctuations. Living in areas with low temperatures, such as the Arctic zone, 
dictates the need for increased energy consumption, which affects the 
composition of the gut microbiome. Methods. In our study, an extensive 
questionnaire was conducted among the participants, where many questions were 
included about the dietary preferences of the study participants, which allowed 
them us to further divide them into groups according to their diets. Stool 
samples were collected from participants from 3 groups: Arctic native, Arctic 
newcomer and the control group. The next step was the isolation of bacterial DNA 
and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The analysis of the results of the diversity 
of the intestinal microbiota was carried out both with and without taking into 
account the dietary preferences of the participants. Results. As a result of 
comparing the intestinal microbiota obtained from residents of the Arctic zone 
with the gut microbiota of residents of other regions with a milder climate, 
significant differences are found. These differences may be related to limited 
food resources and a reduction in the variety of food products characteristic of 
this Arctic region. t was also found that representatives of the bacterial 
families Christensenellaceae and Muribaculaceae dominated the control group, 
both with traditional nutrition and with a dairy-free diet in comparison with 
the Arctic groups. The control group was dominated by representatives of the 
Prevotellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae families compared to the 
Arctic group (with a traditional diet). The results also show that the number of 
representatives of the families Desulfovibrionaceae (with traditional diet) and 
Enterobacteriaceae (with milk-free diet) is growing in the Arctic group. 
Conclusions. In the course of this work, bacterial families characteristic of 
people living in the Arc-tic zone of the Far Eastern region of the Russian 
Federation were identified. Poor diet, difficult climatic conditions, and 
problems with logistics and medical care can have a strong impact on the health 
of this population. The main type of diet for the inhabitants of the Arctic is 
the traditional type of diet. They consume a large number of low-cost products, 
obtainget animal protein from poultry and canned food, and also eat a small 
number of fresh vegetables and fruits. Such a diet is due to the social status 
of the study participants and the climatic and geographical features of the 
region (difficulties in agriculture). With such a diet, we observe a decrease in 
representatives of the Christensenellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Eubacteriaceae, and 
Prevotellaceae families and an increase in representatives of the 
Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae families among Arctic residents. This 
imbalance in the futuremay cause, this population may to develop various 
diseases in the future, including chronic diseases such as obesity, intestinal 
dysbiosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

Human breast milk (HBM) is considered the gold standard for infant nutrition due 
to its optimal nutrient profile and complex composition of cellular and 
non-cellular components. Breastfeeding positively influences the newborn's gut 
microbiota and health, reducing the risk of conditions like gastrointestinal 
infections and chronic diseases (e.g., allergies, asthma, diabetes, and 
obesity). Research has revealed that HBM contains beneficial microbes that aid 
gut microbiota maturation through mechanisms like antimicrobial production and 
pathogen exclusion. The HBM microbiota composition can be affected by several 
factors, including gestational age, delivery mode, medical treatments, lactation 
stage, as well as maternal lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, physical activity, 
sleep quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress level). Particularly, 
lifestyle factors can play a significant role in shaping the HBM microbiota by 
directly modulating the microbial composition or influencing the maternal gut 
microbiota and influencing the HBM microbes through the enteromammary pathway. 
This narrative review of current findings summarized how maternal lifestyle 
influences HBM microbiota. While the influence of maternal diet on HBM 
microbiota is well-documented, indicating that dietary patterns, especially 
those rich in plant-based proteins and complex carbohydrates, can positively 
influence HBM microbiota, the impact of other lifestyle factors is poorly 
investigated. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
is crucial for the health of both mother and baby. Understanding how maternal 
lifestyle factors influence microbial colonization of HBM, along with their 
interactions and impact, is key to developing new strategies that support the 
beneficial maturation of the infant's gut microbiota.

There is an increasing prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCDs) 
like obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, 
allergic asthma, and neuro-developmental/psychiatric problems in many parts of 
the world. A suboptimal lifestyle as an adult is often blamed for the occurrence 
of NCCDs. This review discusses the developmental origin of health and disease 
theory and how suboptimal nutrition in intrauterine life and the establishment 
of a suboptimal gut microbiome during infancy can influence the predisposition 
to NCCDs.

Pulmonary hypertension is a complex condition that has distinct characteristics 
in pediatric populations. This review explores the important role of early 
childhood nutrition in the growth, progression, and management of pediatric 
pulmonary hypertension. Nutritional deficiencies, including those of vitamins C, 
D, and iron, are closely linked to worse outcomes in children with this disease, 
emphasizing the importance of early intervention to prevent malnutrition and 
promote growth. Emerging research revealed that promising nutrients like 
resveratrol, along with modulation of the gut and respiratory microbiomes, may 
offer therapeutic advances for managing pulmonary hypertension. However, the 
current literature is limited by a lack of pediatric-specific studies, with much 
of the data extrapolated from adult populations and animal models, especially 
rats. This review highlights the need for targeted research to develop effective 
nutritional interventions aimed at improving outcomes for pediatric patients.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins (PACs) from black soybean seed coat have 
antioxidant and anti-tumorigenic properties. We investigated the anti-tumor 
properties and mechanisms of action of PACs on colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We fed the APCmin/+ mice, which are highly susceptible to spontaneous 
intestinal adenoma formation, diets supplemented with or without PACs for 7 
weeks and assessed adverse effects, the number and size of intestinal polyps, 
and the expression of pro- and anti-proliferative proteins in the intestine. The 
mouse gut microbiome composition was analyzed, and the concentrations of gut 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified. We also compared CRC incidence 
in Tamba in Japan, where black soybean is consumed frequently, with that in the 
rest of Japan.
RESULTS: The number and size of intestinal polyps notably decreased in the 
PAC-fed mice. Compared with control mice, the PAC-fed mice showed lower 
expression of proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen and β 
catenin and a higher expression of the anti-inflammatory protein oligomeric 
mucus gel-forming. PAC supplementation increased the prevalence and 
concentrations of beneficial gut microbes and SCFAs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet supplemented with black soybean-derived PACs could prevent CRC 
development in mice through gut microbiome remodeling. Regions consuming black 
soybeans have low CRC incidence. Notably, the incidence of CRC, breast cancer, 
and liver cancer was significantly lower in Tamba than in the rest of Hyogo 
Prefecture or Japan. Future studies should delineate the mechanisms underlying 
the CRC-protective effects of PACs. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate the 
potential of including PACs in dietary recommendations for cancer prevention.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) poses a silent threat to human health, 
with prevalence rising at an alarming rate. The treatment and prevention of 
NAFLD depend on novel approaches as no effective treatment options are currently 
available. Berries are unique sources of phenolic compounds that have proven 
roles in disease prevention and health promotion. However, a comprehensive 
review of the effects of different berries on NAFLD and related pathologies is 
lacking. Thus, the present review aims to summarize the effects of berry 
extracts, plant parts, and bioactive compounds from twenty-one different berries 
on NAFLD. The molecular mechanisms involved include the regulation of lipid 
homeostasis, modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation markers, and 
activation of different signaling pathways in different in vitro and in vivo 
NAFLD models. Furthermore, their modulatory effects on the gut microbiota have 
also been highlighted. Clinical intervention research on the benefits of berries 
in NAFLD is limited; nonetheless, this paper discusses clinical studies 
demonstrating the effects of different berries in people with NAFLD. Future 
research should focus on long-term clinical studies to compare the therapeutic 
potentials of different berries against NAFLD.
