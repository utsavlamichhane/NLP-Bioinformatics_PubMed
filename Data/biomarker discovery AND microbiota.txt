BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of childhood obesity annually has led to a 
surge in physical and mental health risks, making it a significant global public 
health concern. This study aimed to discover novel biomarkers of childhood 
simple obesity through integrative multi-omics analysis, uncovering their 
potential connections and providing fresh research directions for the complex 
pathogenesis and treatment strategies.
METHODS: Transcriptome, untargeted metabolome, and 16 S rDNA sequencing were 
conducted on subjects to examine transcripts, metabolites in blood, and gut 
microflora in stool.
RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis identified 599 differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs), of which 25 were immune-related genes, and participated in immune 
pathways such as antimicrobial peptides, neutrophil degranulation, and 
interferons. The optimal random forest model based on these genes exhibited an 
AUC of 0.844. The metabolomic analysis examined 71 differentially expressed 
metabolites (DEMs), including 12 immune-related metabolites. Notably, lauric 
acid showed an extremely strong positive correlation with BMI and showed a good 
discriminative power for obesity (AUC = 0.82). DEMs were found to be 
significantly enriched in four metabolic pathways, namely "Aminoacyl-tRNA 
biosynthesis", "Valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and Glycine", 
"Serine and threonine metabolism", and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty 
acids". Microbiome analysis revealed 12 differential gut microbiotas (DGMs) at 
the phylum and genus levels, with p_Firmicutes dominating in the obese group and 
g_Escherichia-Shigella in the normal group. Subsequently, a Random Forest model 
was developed based on the DEMs, immune-related DEGs, and metabolites with an 
AUC value of 0.912. The 14 indicators identified by this model could potentially 
serve as a set of biomarkers for obesity. The analysis of the inter-omics 
correlation network found 233 pairs of significant correlations. DEGs BPIFA1, 
BPI, and SAA1, DEMs Dimethy(tetradecyl)amine, Deoxycholic acid, Pathalic 
anhydride, and DL-Alanine, and DGMs g_Intestinimonas and g_Turicibacter showed 
strong connectivity within the network, constituting a large proportion of 
interactions.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the first comprehensive description of the 
multi-omics characteristics of childhood simple obesity, recognizing promising 
biomarkers. Immune-related markers offer a new perspective for researching the 
immunological mechanisms underlying obesity and its associated complications. 
The revealed interactions among these biomarkers contribute to a deeper 
understanding the intricate biological regulatory networks associated with 
obesity.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a malignancy with a high incidence and poor prognosis, 
significantly influenced by dysbiosis in the esophageal, oral, and gut 
microbiota. This review provides an overview of the roles of microbiota 
dysbiosis in EC pathogenesis, emphasizing their impact on tumor progression, 
drug efficacy, biomarker discovery, and therapeutic interventions. Lifestyle 
factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut use are major 
contributors to dysbiosis and EC development. Recent studies utilizing advanced 
sequencing have revealed complex interactions between microbiota dysbiosis and 
EC, with oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium 
nucleatum promoting inflammation and suppressing immune responses, thereby 
driving carcinogenesis. Altered esophageal microbiota, characterized by reduced 
beneficial bacteria and increased pathogenic species, further exacerbate local 
inflammation and tumor growth. Gut microbiota dysbiosis also affects systemic 
immunity, influencing chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, with certain 
bacteria enhancing or inhibiting treatment responses. Microbiota composition 
shows potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection, prognosis, and 
personalized therapy. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota-such 
as probiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation-offer 
promising avenues to restore balance and improve treatment efficacy, potentially 
enhancing patient outcomes. Integrating microbiome-focused strategies into 
current therapeutic frameworks could improve EC management, reduce adverse 
effects, and enhance patient survival. These findings highlight the need for 
further research into microbiota-tumor interactions and microbial interventions 
to transform EC treatment and prevention, particularly in cases of late-stage 
diagnosis and poor treatment response.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is recognized as a pivotal factor in the 
pathophysiology of sarcopenia-a condition marked by the accelerated loss of 
muscle strength, mass and function with ageing. Despite this well-known 
gut-muscle axis, the potential links between other microbial ecosystems and 
sarcopenia remain largely unexplored. The oral microbiome has been linked to 
various age-related health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
colorectal cancer. However, its potential association with sarcopenia is 
unknown. The Saliva and Muscle (SaMu) study seeks to address this knowledge gap.
METHODS: The SaMu study comprises three sequential phases. In phase 1, a 
cross-sectional analysis will be conducted on a cohort of 200 individuals aged 
70 years or older to examine the relationship between salivary microbiome and 
sarcopenia status. Participants will be recruited in the three main places of 
living: general community, assisted living facilities and nursing homes. The 
salivary microbiome composition will be evaluated utilizing shotgun metagenomics 
sequencing, while sarcopenia status will be determined through muscle mass 
(determined by whole-body bioelectrical impedance analysis and calf 
circumference), muscle strength (grip strength and the 5-times-sit-to-stand 
test) and physical performance (usual walking speed). In addition to 
investigating the microbiome composition, the study aims to elucidate microbiome 
functions by exploring potential omic associations with sarcopenia. To achieve 
this, salivary proteomics, metabolomics and quorum sensing peptidomics will be 
performed. Covariates that will be measured include clinical variables 
(sociodemographic factors, health status, health-related behaviours, oral health 
and quality of life) as well as blood variables (immune profiling, hormones, 
kidney and liver function, electrolytes and haematocrit). In phase 2, an 
in-depth mechanistic analysis will be performed on an envisaged subcohort of 50 
participants. This analysis will explore pathways in muscle tissue using 
histology, genomics and transcriptomics, focusing on (maximal) 25 healthy older 
adults and (maximal) 25 with severe sarcopenia. Phase 3 involves a two-year 
clinical follow-up of the initial participants from the cross-sectional 
analysis, along with a resampling of blood and saliva. Additionally, secondary 
outcomes like falls, hospitalization and mortality will be examined.
DISCUSSION: Using a salivary multi-omics approach, SaMu primarily aims to 
clarify the associations between the oral microbiome and sarcopenia. SaMu is 
expected to contribute to the discovery of predictive biomarkers of sarcopenia 
as well as to the identification of potential novel targets to prevent/tackle 
sarcopenia. This study-protocol is submitted for registration at the ISRCTN 
registry.

Liver fibrosis (LF) is a common sequela to diverse chronic liver injuries, 
leading to rising rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As the 
medicinal and edible homologous material, traditional teas have exhibited 
promising applications in the clinical management of liver fibrosis. Here, we 
generated a liver fibrosis mouse model to explore the potent therapeutic ability 
of Ampelopsis grossedentata (AG) tea on this condition by multi-omics analysis. 
The biochemistry results pointed towards mitigated increases of ALT, AST, TBIL, 
and ALP triggered by BDL in the AG-treated group. Examination using H&E and 
Sirius Red staining revealed severe liver injuries, inflammation infiltration, 
amplified fibrosed regions, and the creation of bile ducts, all of which were 
fallout from BDL. Immunohistochemistry findings also implicated a noteworthy 
upregulation of the HSC activation marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the 
fibrosis marker collagen I in the BDL group. However, these symptoms 
demonstrated a significant improvement in the group treated with 100 mg/kg AG. 
Findings from the Western Blot test corroborated the prominent elevation of 
TNF-α, col1a1, α-SMA, and TGF-β, instigated by BDL, while AG treatment 
meaningfully modulated these proteins. Furthermore, our study underscored the 
potential involvement of several microbiota, such as Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, 
Eubacterium Ruminantium, Ruminococcus 1, Christensenellaceae R-7, Acetatifactor, 
Dubosiella, Parasutterella, Faecalibaculum, and Defluviitaleaceae UCG-011, in 
the progression of liver fibrosis and the therapeutic efficacy of AG. This 
investigation shows that during the process of AG ameliorating BDL-induced liver 
fibrosis, bile acid derivatives such as CDCA, TCDCA, 3-DHC, UCA, DCA, among 
others, play significant roles. In this study, we identified that several 
non-bile acid metabolites, such as Deltarasin, Thr-Ile-Arg, etc., are entailed 
in the process of AG improving liver fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review summarizes eight studies involving 558 
cesarean section (CS)-born infants (274 exposed to vaginal seeding (VS), 284 not 
exposed) and 261 infants born vaginally to investigate the effect of VS on gut 
microbiome colonization and development in CS-born infants.
METHODS: This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Relevant articles published before March 
6, 2024, were identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Web 
of Science. We included experimental studies that investigated changes in the 
gut microbiota of CS-born infants following VS and reported changes in the gut 
microbiota. The relationship between VS and the gut microbiota composition of 
CS-born infants was assessed.
RESULTS: VS may selectively influence the abundance of bacterial genera from 
various phyla, such as an increased relative abundance of Bacteroides and 
Lactobacillus, in the gut microbiome of CS-seeded infants compared to 
CS-non-seeded infants. Conflicting results mainly concern microbial diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates modest changes in the gut microbiome of 
CS-born infants following VS. However, further clinical studies are necessary to 
fully understand its impact on early-life health outcomes, particularly 
regarding potential microbiome alterations and associated health risks.

Bile acids (BAs) undergo extensive microbial metabolism in the gut and exert 
hormone-like functions on physiological processes underlying metabolic risk. 
However, the extent to which gut BA profiles predict cardiometabolic risk and 
explain individual responses to dietary interventions in humans is still 
unclear. In the DIRECT-PLUS Trial, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of 284 
participants randomized into three groups: healthy dietary guidelines and two 
Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) groups. We longitudinally measured 44 fecal BAs 
using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the gut microbiome through 
shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and body adiposity and serum lipids at baseline, 
6, and 18 months. Fecal levels of 14 BAs, such as lithocholic acid and 
ursodeoxycholic acid, were prospectively associated with body mass index (BMI) 
and serum lipid profiles (false discovery rate [q]<0.05). Baseline fecal BA 
levels significantly modified the beneficial effects of the MedDiet; for 
example, BMI reduction induced by MedDiet interventions was more pronounced in 
individuals with lower 12-dehydrocholic acid levels (q-interaction <0.001). We 
confirmed that the gut microbiome is a major modifier of the secondary BA pool 
in humans. Furthermore, the association of fecal BAs with body adiposity and 
serum lipids varied significantly in individuals with different abundances of 
gut microbes carrying BA metabolism enzymes, e.g. several Ruminococcus spp. In 
summary, our study identifies novel predictive biomarkers for cardiometabolic 
risk and offers new mechanistic insights to guide personalized dietary 
interventions.

Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are benign cerebrovascular maladies characterized 
by wall dilatation in the intracranial arteries. Nevertheless, spontaneous 
aneurysmal rupture can cause a life-threatening spontaneous subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH). Emerging evidence indicates potential associations between gut 
dysbiosis and IAs pathogenesis, though the relationship with IA rupture remains 
unclear. This research analyzed 124 fecal samples for microbiomics and 160 for 
metabolomics, with the discovery and validation sets established for 
cross-validation. We identified differential gut microbiota and metabolites 
associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) and developed a superior 
risk assessment model. Subsequent integrative analyses and validation revealed a 
significant link between disrupted unsaturated fatty acid and essential amino 
acid metabolic pathways and IA rupture, driven by alterations in gut microbiota. 
This study underscores the potential association between the gut-brain axis and 
IA rupture, while also highlighting gut microbiota dysbiosis as a potential risk 
factor for IA rupture and providing biomarkers for assessment.

This chapter presents an overview of the emerging strategies to address the 
unmet needs in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD poses 
significant challenges, as over half of patients experience disease progression 
despite interventions, leading to irreversible complications, and a substantial 
proportion do not respond to existing therapies, such as biologics. To overcome 
these limitations, we describe a diverse array of novel therapeutic approaches. 
In the area of immune homeostasis restoration, the focus is on targeting 
cytokine networks, leukocyte trafficking, novel immune pathways, and cell 
therapies involving regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). 
Recognizing the critical role of impaired intestinal barrier integrity in IBD, 
we highlight therapies aimed at restoring barrier function and promoting mucosal 
healing, such as those targeting cell proliferation, tight junctions, and lipid 
mediators. Addressing the challenges posed by fibrosis and fistulas, we describe 
emerging targets for reversing fibrosis like kinase and cytokine inhibitors and 
nuclear receptor agonists, as well as the potential of MSC for fistulas. The 
restoration of a healthy gut microbiome, through strategies like fecal 
microbiota transplantation, rationally defined bacterial consortia, and targeted 
antimicrobials, is also highlighted. We also describe innovative approaches to 
gut-targeted drug delivery to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects. 
Reinforcing these advancements is the critical role of precision medicine, which 
emphasizes the use of multiomics analysis for the discovery of biomarkers to 
enable personalized IBD care. Overall, the emerging landscape of therapeutic 
opportunities for IBD holds great potential to surpass the therapeutic ceiling 
of current treatments.

exerting both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Emerging research 
underscores the significance of IL-6 trans-signaling over classical signaling 
pathways, which has shifted the focus of therapeutic strategies. Additionally, 
the synergistic action of TNF-α and IFN-γ has been found to induce inflammatory 
cell death through PANoptosis, further amplifying the severity of cytokine 
storms. Long COVID-19 patients, as well as those with cytokine storms triggered 
by other conditions, exhibit distinct laboratory profiles, indicating the need 
for targeted approaches to diagnosis and management. Growing evidence also 
highlights the gut microbiota's crucial role in modulating the immune response 
during COVID-19 by affecting cytokine production, adding further complexity to 
the disease's immunological landscape. Targeted intervention strategies should 
focus on specific cytokine cutoffs, though accurate cytokine quantification 
remains a clinical challenge. Current treatment strategies are increasingly 
focused on inhibiting IL-6 trans-signaling, which offers promise for more 
precise therapeutic approaches to manage hyperinflammatory responses in 
COVID-19. In light of recent discoveries, this review summarizes key research 
findings on cytokine storms, particularly their role in COVID-19 and other 
inflammatory conditions. It explores emerging therapeutic strategies targeting 
cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, while also addressing open questions, 
such as the need for better biomarkers to detect and manage cytokine storms. 
Additionally, the review highlights ongoing challenges in developing targeted 
treatments that mitigate hyperinflammation without compromising immune function, 
emphasizing the importance of continued research in this field.

BACKGROUND: Gut bacteria are related to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
However, there is inconsistency in ICI-associated species, while the role of 
non-bacterial microbes in immunotherapy remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the 
association of trans-kingdom microbes with ICIs by multi-cohort multi-cancer 
analyses.
METHODS: We retrieved fecal metagenomes from 1,359 ICI recipients with four 
different cancers (metastatic melanoma [MM], non-small cell lung carcinoma 
[NSCLC], renal cell cancer [RCC], and hepatocellular carcinoma) from 12 
published datasets. Microbiota composition was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank 
test. The performance of microbial biomarkers in predicting ICI response was 
assessed by random forest. Key responder-associated microbes were functionally 
examined in vitro and in mice.
FINDINGS: Trans-kingdom gut microbiota (bacteria, eukaryotes, viruses, and 
archaea) was significantly different between ICI responders and non-responders 
in multi-cancer. Bacteria (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus comes) and 
eukaryotes (Nemania serpens, Hyphopichia pseudoburtonii) were consistently 
enriched in responders of ≥2 cancer types or from ≥3 cohorts, contrasting with 
the depleted bacterium Hungatella hathewayi. Responder-associated species in 
each cancer were revealed, such as F. prausnitzii in MM and 6 species in NSCLC. 
These signature species influenced ICI efficacy by modulating CD8+ T cell 
activity in vitro and in mice. Moreover, bacterial and eukaryotic biomarkers 
showed great performance in predicting ICI response in patients from discovery 
and two validation cohorts (MM: area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve [AUROC] = 72.27%-80.19%; NSCLC: AUROC = 72.70%-87.98%; RCC: AUROC = 
83.33%-89.58%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified trans-kingdom microbial signatures associated 
with ICI in multi-cancer and specific cancer types. Trans-kingdom microbial 
biomarkers are potential predictors of ICI response in patients with cancer.

Considering the bidirectional crosstalk along the gut-liver axis, gut-derived 
microorganisms and metabolites can be released into the liver, potentially 
leading to liver injury. In this editorial, we comment on several studies 
published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Gastroenterology. We focus 
specifically on the roles of gut microbiota in selected gastrointestinal (GI) 
diseases that are prevalent, such as inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and hepatitis B virus-related 
portal hypertension. Over the past few decades, findings from both preclinical 
and clinical studies have indicated an association between compositional and 
metabolic changes in the gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of the 
aforementioned GI disorders. However, studies elucidating the mechanisms 
underlying the host-microbiota interactions remain limited. The purpose of this 
editorial is to summarize current findings and provide insights regarding the 
context-specific roles of gut microbiota. Ultimately, the discovery of 
microbiome-based biomarkers may facilitate disease diagnosis and the development 
of personalized medicine.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is recognized as a systemic immune-mediated 
disease (IMID), sharing genetic and environmental risk factors with other IMIDs 
such as inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Over time, correlating 
clinical findings with genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic results has been 
challenging due to diverse sampling methods, analysis techniques, and the use of 
variable clinical phenotype descriptions across studies. This review aims to 
summarize the results from various omics fields to explore the etiopathology of 
HS. Genetic studies highlight defects in Notch and γ-secretase signaling and 
inflammasome function. Syndromic HS involves specific mutations in 
autoinflammatory syndromes such as pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma 
gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) and pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and HS (PASH). 
Proteomic analyses reveal key inflammatory pathways indicating activation of 
both innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, microbiome studies show an 
increased presence of anaerobes like Prevotella in HS lesions and a decreased 
presence of commensals such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gut microbiota 
dysbiosis, particularly involving Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium ramosum, 
is associated with HS. Moreover, metabolomic profiling indicates dysregulated 
tryptophan catabolism and lipid metabolism, with increased 
5-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites and odd-chain fatty acids suggesting 
bacterial involvement. In summary, despite advances, robust associations between 
genetics, proteomics, microbiome, and metabolomics in HS are still lacking. 
Integrating these datasets could identify new clinical phenotypes, genetic 
predispositions, microbial signatures, and therapeutic targets, enhancing 
personalized treatment strategies and biomarker discovery for HS classification, 
prognosis, and treatment response.

Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations influence brain 
function and could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The 
potential of using fecal microbiota signatures to aid autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) detection is still not fully explored. Here, we assessed the potential of 
different levels of microbial markers (taxonomy and genome) in distinguishing 
children with ASD from age and gender-matched typically developing peers 
(n = 598, ASD vs TD = 273 vs 325). A combined microbial taxa and 
metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) markers showed a better performance than 
either microbial taxa or microbial MAGs alone for detecting ASD. A 
machine-learning model comprising 5 bacterial taxa and 44 microbial MAG markers 
(2 viral MAGs and 42 bacterial MAGs) achieved an area under the receiving 
operator curve (AUROC) of 0.886 in the discovery cohort and 0.734 in an 
independent validation cohort. Furthermore, the identified biomarkers and 
predicted ASD risk score also significantly correlated with the core symptoms 
measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). The microbiome panel 
showed a superior classification performance in younger children (≤6 years old) 
with an AUROC of 0.845 than older children (>6 years). The model was broadly 
applicable to subjects across genders, with or without gastrointestinal tract 
symptoms (constipation and diarrhea) and with or without psychiatric 
comorbidities (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and anxiety). This 
study highlights the potential clinical validity of fecal microbiome to aid in 
ASD diagnosis and will facilitate studies to understand the association of 
disturbance of human gut microbiota and ASD symptom severity.

Associations between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been 
widely investigated. However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across 
multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to 
investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential 
diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five 
independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control 
samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition 
and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific 
microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known 
as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing 
to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila 
exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called 
NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a 
classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high 
performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways 
related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways. These findings illuminate 
the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and PD, offering insights 
into potential therapeutic interventions and personalized diagnostic strategies.

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated forage 
crops globally, and its nutritional quality critically influences the 
productivity of dairy cows. Silage fermentation is recognized as a crucial 
technique for the preservation of fresh forage, ensuring the retention of its 
vital nutrients. However, the detailed microbial components and their functions 
in silage fermentation are not fully understood. This study integrated 
large-scale microbial culturing with high-throughput sequencing to thoroughly 
examine the microbial community structure in alfalfa silage and explored the 
potential pathways of nutritional degradation via metagenomic analysis. The 
findings revealed an enriched microbial diversity in silage, indicated by the 
identification of amplicon sequence variants. Significantly, the large-scale 
culturing approach recovered a considerable number of unique microbes 
undetectable by high-throughput sequencing. Predominant genera, such as 
Lactiplantibacillus, Leuconostoc, Lentilactobacillus, Weissella, and 
Liquorilactobacillus, were identified based on their abundance and prevalence. 
Additionally, genes associated with Enterobacteriaceae were discovered, which 
might be involved in pathways leading to the production of ammonia-N and butyric 
acid. Overall, this study offers a comprehensive insight into the microbial 
ecology of silage fermentation and provides valuable information for leveraging 
microbial consortia to enhance fermentation quality.
IMPORTANCE: Silage fermentation is a microbial-driven anaerobic process that 
efficiently converts various substrates into nutrients readily absorbable and 
metabolizable by ruminant animals. This study, integrating culturomics and 
metagenomics, has successfully identified core microorganisms involved in silage 
fermentation, including those at low abundance. This discovery is crucial for 
the targeted cultivation of specific microorganisms to optimize fermentation 
processes. Furthermore, our research has uncovered signature microorganisms that 
play pivotal roles in nutrient metabolism, significantly advancing our 
understanding of the intricate relationships between microbial communities and 
nutrient degradation during silage fermentation.

Akkermansia muciniphila is a gut bacterium that colonizes the gut mucosa, has a 
role in maintaining gut health and shows promise for potential therapeutic 
applications. The discovery of A. muciniphila as an important member of our gut 
microbiome, occupying an extraordinary niche in the human gut, has led to new 
hypotheses on gut health, beneficial microorganisms and host-microbiota 
interactions. This microorganism has established a unique position in human 
microbiome research, similar to its role in the gut ecosystem. Its unique traits 
in using mucin sugars and mechanisms of action that can modify host health have 
made A. muciniphila a subject of enormous attention from multiple research 
fields. A. muciniphila is becoming a model organism studied for its ability to 
modulate human health and gut microbiome structure, leading to commercial 
products, a genetic model and possible probiotic formulations. This Review 
provides an overview of A. muciniphila and Akkermansia genus phylogeny, 
ecophysiology and diversity. Furthermore, the Review discusses perspectives on 
ecology, strategies for harnessing beneficial effects of A. muciniphila for 
human mucosal metabolic and gut health, and its potential as a biomarker for 
diagnostics and prognostics.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized immuno-oncology 
with effective clinical responses, only 30 to 40 % of patients respond to ICIs, 
highlighting the need for reliable biomarkers to predict and enhance therapeutic 
outcomes. This study investigated how amino acid, glycolysis, and bile acid 
metabolism affect ICI efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. 
Through targeted metabolomic profiling and machine learning analysis, we 
identified amino acid metabolism as a key factor, with histidine (His) linked to 
favorable outcomes and homocysteine (HCys), phenylalanine (Phe), and sarcosine 
(Sar) linked to poor outcomes. Importantly, the His/HCys+Phe+Sar ratio emerges 
as a robust biomarker. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of glycolysis-related 
metabolites, particularly lactate. Elevated lactate levels post-immunotherapy 
treatment correlate with poorer outcomes, underscoring lactate as a potential 
indicator of treatment efficacy. Moreover, specific bile acids, 
glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), are 
associated with better survival and therapeutic response. Particularly, TLCA 
enhances T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity, suggesting its utility as a 
predictive biomarker and therapeutic agent. We also suggest a connection between 
gut microbiota and TLCA levels, with the Eubacterium genus modulating this 
relationship. Therefore, modulating specific metabolic pathways-particularly 
amino acid, glycolysis, and bile acid metabolism-could predict and enhance the 
efficacy of ICI therapy in NSCLC patients, with potential implications for 
personalized treatment strategies in immuno-oncology. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: Our 
study identifies metabolic biomarkers and pathways that could predict and 
enhance the outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in NSCLC patients.

Dendritic cells (DCs), and especially so conventional type I DCs (cDC1s), are 
fundamental regulators of anticancer immunity, largely reflecting their superior 
ability to engulf tumor-derived material and process it for cross-presentation 
on MHC Class I molecules to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Thus, 
investigating key DC functions including (but not limited to) phagocytic 
capacity, expression of CTL-activating ligands on the cell surface, and 
cross-presentation efficacy is an important component of multiple 
immuno-oncology studies. Unfortunately, DCs are terminally differentiated cells, 
implying that they cannot be propagated indefinitely in vitro and hence must be 
generated ad hoc from circulating or bone marrow-derived precursors, which 
presents several limitations. Here, we propose a simple, cytofluorometric method 
to quantify phenotypic activation markers including CD80, CD86 and MHC class II 
molecules on the surface of a conditionally immortalized immature DC line that 
can be indefinitely propagated in vitro but also driven into maturation at will 
with a simple change in culture conditions. Upon appropriate scaling and 
automatization, this approach is compatible with high-throughput screening 
programs for the discovery of novel DC activators that do not suffer from batch 
variability and other limitations associated with the generation of fresh DCs.

Despite recent progress in our understanding of the association between the gut 
microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the role of microbiome 
biomarkers in IBD diagnosis remains underexplored. Here we developed a 
microbiome-based diagnostic test for IBD. By utilization of metagenomic data 
from 5,979 fecal samples with and without IBD from different geographies and 
ethnicities, we identified microbiota alterations in IBD and selected ten and 
nine bacterial species for construction of diagnostic models for ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn's disease, respectively. These diagnostic models achieved 
areas under the curve >0.90 for distinguishing IBD from controls in the 
discovery cohort, and maintained satisfactory performance in transethnic 
validation cohorts from eight populations. We further developed a multiplex 
droplet digital polymerase chain reaction test targeting selected IBD-associated 
bacterial species, and models based on this test showed numerically higher 
performance than fecal calprotectin in discriminating ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn's disease from controls. Here we discovered universal IBD-associated 
bacteria and show the potential applicability of a multibacteria biomarker panel 
as a noninvasive tool for IBD diagnosis.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2024 Jun 13:2024.06.11.24307076. doi: 10.1101/2024.06.11.24307076.

Globally, severe acute malnutrition (SAM), defined as a weight-for-length 
z-score more than three SDs below a reference mean (WLZ < -3), affects 14 
million children under 5 years of age. Complete anthropometric recovery after 
standard, short-term interventions is rare, with children often left with 
moderate acute malnutrition (MAM; WLZ -2 to -3). We conducted a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) involving 12- to 18-month-old Bangladeshi children from 
urban and rural sites, who, after initial hospital-based treatment for SAM, 
received a 3-month intervention with a microbiome-directed complementary food 
(MDCF-2) or a calorically more dense, standard ready-to-use supplementary food 
(RUSF). The rate of WLZ improvement was significantly greater in MDCF-2-treated 
children (P = 8.73 × 10-3), similar to our previous RCT of Bangladeshi children 
with MAM without antecedent SAM (P = 0.032). A correlated meta-analysis of 
plasma levels of 4520 proteins in both RCTs revealed 215 positively associated 
with WLZ (largely representing musculoskeletal and central nervous system 
development) and 44 negatively associated (primarily related to immune 
activation). Moreover, the positively associated proteins were significantly 
enriched by MDCF-2 (q = 1.1 × 10-6). Characterizing the abundances of 754 
bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes in serially collected fecal samples 
disclosed the effects of acute rehabilitation for SAM on the microbiome and how, 
during treatment for MAM, specific strains of Prevotella copri function at the 
intersection between MDCF-2 glycan metabolism and anthropometric recovery. These 
results provide a rationale for further testing the generalizability of MDCF 
efficacy and for identifying biomarkers to define treatment responses.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and the 
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Recent research highlights the 
pivotal role of the gut microbiota in CRC development and progression. 
Understanding the complex interplay between disease development and metagenomic 
data is essential for CRC diagnosis and treatment. Current computational models 
employ machine learning to identify metagenomic biomarkers associated with CRC, 
yet there is a need to improve their accuracy through a holistic biological 
knowledge perspective. This study aims to evaluate CRC-associated metagenomic 
data at species, enzymes, and pathway levels via conducting global and 
population-specific analyses. These analyses utilize relative abundance values 
from human gut microbiome sequencing data and robust classification models are 
built for disease prediction and biomarker identification. For global CRC 
prediction and biomarker identification, the features that are identified by 
SelectKBest (SKB), Information Gain (IG), and Extreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) methods are combined. Population-based analysis includes 
within-population, leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) and cross-population approaches. 
Four classification algorithms are employed for CRC classification. Random 
Forest achieved an AUC of 0.83 for species data, 0.78 for enzyme data and 0.76 
for pathway data globally. On the global scale, potential taxonomic biomarkers 
include ruthenibacterium lactatiformanas; enzyme biomarkers include RNA 2' 3' 
cyclic 3' phosphodiesterase; and pathway biomarkers include pyruvate 
fermentation to acetone pathway. This study underscores the potential of machine 
learning models trained on metagenomic data for improved disease prediction and 
biomarker discovery. The proposed model and associated files are available at

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterised by repeated 
relapses and remissions and a high recurrence rate even after symptom 
resolution. The primary method for IBD diagnosis is endoscopy; however, this 
method is expensive, invasive, and cumbersome to use serially. Therefore, more 
convenient and non-invasive methods for IBD diagnosis are needed. In this study, 
we aimed to identify biological gas markers for the development of gut 
inflammation. Using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse models, 
five biological gases were analysed to identify predictive markers for the 
development of gut inflammation. Additionally, the correlation between the 
changes in gas composition, gut microbiota, and inflammatory markers was 
assessed. The hydrogen (H2) level was found to be negatively correlated with the 
level of lipocalin-2 (LCN2), a gut inflammation biomarker, and weight loss due 
to DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, gut microbes belonging to the Rikenellaceae 
and Akkermansiaceae families were positively correlated with LCN2 levels and 
weight loss, whereas Tannerellaceae abundance was negatively correlated with 
LCN2 level and weight loss and positively correlated with H2 levels. This study 
provides new insights for IBD diagnosis; the H2 levels in biological gases are a 
potential biomarker for intestinal inflammation, and specific gut microbes are 
associated with H2 level changes.

Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical 
disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the 
rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the 
gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the 
contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been 
associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal 
immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping 
disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, 
and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon 
has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In 
fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an 
overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and 
development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LBP) strains are emerging as promising 
psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able 
to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial 
metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of 
neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the 
benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.

Stable biomarker discovery in multi-omics data via canonical correlation 
analysis.

Multi-omics analysis offers a promising avenue to a better understanding of 
complex biological phenomena. In particular, untangling the pathophysiology of 
multifactorial health conditions such as the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
could benefit from simultaneous consideration of several omics levels. However, 
taking full advantage of multi-omics data requires the adoption of suitable new 
tools. Multi-view learning, a machine learning technique that natively joins 
together heterogeneous data, is a natural source for such methods. Here we 
present a new approach to variable selection in unsupervised multi-view learning 
by applying stability selection to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We 
apply our method, StabilityCCA, to simulated and real multi-omics data, and 
demonstrate its ability to find relevant variables and improve the stability of 
variable selection. In a case study on an IBD microbiome data set, we link 
together metagenomics and metabolomics, revealing a connection between their 
joint structure and the disease, and identifying potential biomarkers. Our 
results showcase the usefulness of multi-view learning in multi-omics analysis 
and demonstrate StabilityCCA as a powerful tool for biomarker discovery.

Extracellular vesicles have emerged as key players in cellular communication, 
influencing various physiological processes and pathophysiological progression, 
including digestion, immune response, and tissue repairs. Recently, a class of 
EVs derived from microbial communities has gained significant attention due to 
their pivotal role in intercellular communication and their potential as 
biomarkers and biotherapeutic agents. Microbial EVs are membrane-bound molecules 
encapsulating bioactive metabolites that modulate host physiological and 
pathological processes. This chapter discusses the evolving history of 
microbiota-produced EVs, including their discovery, characterization, current 
research status, and their diverse mechanisms of interaction with other microbes 
and hosts. This review also highlights the importance of EVs in health and 
disease and discusses recent research that shows promising results for the 
therapeutic potential of EVs.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is globally recognized as a significant health 
concern, with diabetic foot (DF) identified as a severe long-term complication 
that can lead to tissue death or amputation. The discovery of the impact of 
mycobiota, a diverse group of multicellular eukaryotes in the gut microbiome, on 
the onset of endocrine disorders holds great significance. Therefore, this 
research aimed to examine variations in fungal mycobiome and identify potential 
biomarkers for T2DM and T2DM-DF. Fecal and blood samples were collected from 33 
individuals with T2DM, 32 individuals with T2DM-DF, and 32 healthy individuals 
without any health conditions (HC). Blood samples were used for laboratory 
parameters analysis, while total DNA was extracted from fecal samples and 
sequenced using Illumina 18s rRNA. Bioinformatics tools were employed to analyze 
fungal abundance and diversity, revealing differentially expressed fungal 
species and signature fungi that distinguished between T2DM, T2DM-DF, and HC 
groups. Firstly, significant alterations in some laboratory parameters were 
observed among the three groups, which also differed between T2DM and T2DM-DF. 
The diversity of gut fungi in T2DM and T2DM-DF significantly differed from that 
of the HC group; however, more pronounced changes were observed in T2DM-DF. 
Additionally, two significantly altered phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, 
were identified with higher Ascomycota abundance but lower Basidiomycota 
abundance in both the T2DM and T2DM-DF compared to the HC group. Furthermore, 
the top 15 fungi showing significant changes at the species level included a 
notable decrease in Rhodotorula_mucilaginosa abundance in patients with T2DM 
compared to HC and a substantial increase in unclassified_g_Candida abundance 
specifically seen only among patients with T2DM-DF, but not among those 
diagnosed with T2DM or HC. Thirdly, KEGG was employed to analyze enzyme 
expression across the three groups, revealing a more pronounced alteration in 
gut fungal function within T2DM-DF compared to T2DM. Subsequently, to accurately 
identify signature fungi in each group, a random forest was utilized to rank the 
top 15 significant fungi. Notably, 11 fungi were identified as potential 
biomarkers for distinguishing T2DM or T2DM-DF from HC, while eight fungi could 
discriminate between T2DM and T2DM-DF. Furthermore, receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated enhanced accuracy of predicted 
outcomes. These findings suggest that changes in fungal mycobiome are closely 
associated with the progression and complications of T2DM and DF, offering 
promising prospects for diagnosis and treatment.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Identifying outcomes and clinical trial endpoints enabled the 
discovery of new inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatments. Herein, we 
describe efforts to advance the study of gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in 
systemic sclerosis (SSc).
RECENT FINDINGS: Insights into the scope of the problem, as well as advancements 
in the measurement and treatment of SSc-GI, are underway. Proposed SSc 
esophageal endophenotypes are now defined, risk stratification methods are 
growing, and imaging and functional studies are now employed to guide 
therapeutic interventions. Additional progress is being made in characterizing 
the gut microbiome in patients with SSc. Research into the role of the immune 
response in the pathogenesis of SSc-GI disease is also ongoing, evolving 
simultaneously with the development of methods to facilitate data collection 
with real-time capture of diet, exercise, and medication data.
SUMMARY: Multidisciplinary teams are working to deepen our understanding of 
SSc-GI disease pathogenesis, to identify biomarkers for risk stratification and 
the assessment of disease activity, and to develop and validate outcomes and 
clinical trial endpoints to pave the way toward effective therapy for SSc-GI 
disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant form of dementia, presenting 
significant and escalating global challenges. Its etiology is intricate and 
diverse, stemming from a combination of factors such as aging, genetics, and 
environment. Our current understanding of AD pathologies involves various 
hypotheses, such as the cholinergic, amyloid, tau protein, inflammatory, 
oxidative stress, metal ion, glutamate excitotoxicity, microbiota-gut-brain 
axis, and abnormal autophagy. Nonetheless, unraveling the interplay among these 
pathological aspects and pinpointing the primary initiators of AD require 
further elucidation and validation. In the past decades, most clinical drugs 
have been discontinued due to limited effectiveness or adverse effects. 
Presently, available drugs primarily offer symptomatic relief and often 
accompanied by undesirable side effects. However, recent approvals of aducanumab 
(1) and lecanemab (2) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) present the 
potential in disrease-modifying effects. Nevertheless, the long-term efficacy 
and safety of these drugs need further validation. Consequently, the quest for 
safer and more effective AD drugs persists as a formidable and pressing task. 
This review discusses the current understanding of AD pathogenesis, advances in 
diagnostic biomarkers, the latest updates of clinical trials, and emerging 
technologies for AD drug development. We highlight recent progress in the 
discovery of selective inhibitors, dual-target inhibitors, allosteric 
modulators, covalent inhibitors, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) modulators. Our goal is to provide insights 
into the prospective development and clinical application of novel AD drugs.

Early identification of neonatal jaundice (NJ) appears to be essential to avoid 
bilirubin encephalopathy and neurological sequelae. The interaction between gut 
microbiota and metabolites plays an important role in early life. It is unclear 
whether the composition of the gut microbiota and metabolites can be used as an 
early indicator of NJ or to aid clinical decision-making. This study involved a 
total of 196 neonates and conducted two rounds of "discovery-validation" 
research on the gut microbiome-metabolome. It utilized methods of machine 
learning, causal inference, and clinical prediction model evaluation to assess 
the significance of gut microbiota and metabolites in classifying neonatal 
jaundice (NJ), as well as the potential causal relationships between 
corresponding clinical variables and NJ. In the discovery stage, NJ-associated 
gut microbiota, network modules, and metabolite composition were identified by 
gut microbiome-metabolome association analysis. The NJ-associated gut microbiota 
was closely related to bile acid metabolites. By Lasso machine learning 
assessment, we found that the gut bacteria were associated with abnormal bile 
acid metabolism. The machine learning-causal inference approach revealed that 
gut bacteria affected serum total bilirubin and NJ by influencing bile acid 
metabolism. NJ-associated gut bile acids are potential biomarkers of NJ, and 
clinical prediction models constructed based on these biomarkers have some 
clinical effects and the model may be used for disease risk prediction. In the 
validation stage, it was found that intestinal metabolites can predict NJ, and 
the machine learning-causal inference approach revealed that bile acid 
metabolites affected NJ itself by affecting the total bilirubin content. 
Intestinal bile acid metabolites are potential biomarkers of NJ. By applying 
machine learning-causal inference methods to gut microbiome-metabolome 
association studies, we found NJ-associated intestinal bacteria and their 
network modules and bile acid metabolite composition. The important role of 
intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolites in NJ was determined, which can 
predict the risk of NJ.

Plain Language Summary: Association analysis of the intestinal 
microbiome-metabolome found that neonatal jaundice (NJ)-related intestinal 
microbiota, network modules and metabolite composition, and the intestinal 
microbiota are closely related to bile acid metabolites.Gut bacteria were found 
to affect serum total bilirubin (TBIL) and NJ by influencing bile acid 
metabolism through a machine learning-causal inference approach, and bile acid 
metabolites affected NJ itself by affecting the TBIL content.NJ-associated gut 
bacteria and bile acids are potential biomarkers of NJ, and clinical 
decision-making models based on these biomarkers have some clinical effects for 
disease risk prediction.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is prevalent among pregnant individuals and 
is linked to increased risks for both mothers and fetuses. Although GDM is known 
to cause disruptions in gut microbiota and metabolites, their potential 
transmission to the fetus has not been fully explored. This study aimed to 
characterize the similarities in microbial and metabolic signatures between 
mothers with GDM and their neonates as well as the interactions between these 
signatures. This study included 89 maternal-neonate pairs (44 in the GDM group 
and 45 in the normoglycemic group). We utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
untargeted metabolomics to analyze the gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics of 
mothers and neonates. Integrative analyses were performed to elucidate the 
interactions between these omics. Distinct microbial and metabolic signatures 
were observed in GDM mothers and their neonates compared to those in the 
normoglycemic group. Fourteen genera showed similar alterations across both 
groups. Metabolites linked to glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism were 
differentially influenced in GDM, with similar trends observed in both mothers 
and neonates in the GDM group. Network analysis indicated significant 
associations between Qipengyuania and metabolites related to bile acid 
metabolism in mothers and newborns. Furthermore, we observed a significant 
correlation between several genera and metabolites and clinical phenotypes in 
normoglycemic mothers and newborns, but these correlations were disrupted in the 
GDM group. Our findings suggest that GDM consistently affects both the 
microbiota and metabolome in mothers and neonates, thus elucidating the 
mechanism underlying metabolic transmission across generations. These insights 
contribute to knowledge regarding the multiomics interactions in GDM and 
underscore the need to further investigate the prenatal environmental impacts on 
offspring metabolism.

Changes in plasma and fecal metabolomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression 
(normal-adenoma-CRC) remain unclear. Here, plasma and fecal samples were 
collected from four independent cohorts of 1,251 individuals (422 CRC, 399 
colorectal adenoma [CRA], and 430 normal controls [NC]). By metabolomic 
profiling, signature plasma and fecal metabolites with consistent shift across 
NC, CRA, and CRC are identified, including CRC-enriched oleic acid and 
CRC-depleted allocholic acid. Oleic acid exhibits pro-tumorigenic effects in CRC 
cells, patient-derived organoids, and two murine CRC models, whereas allocholic 
acid has opposing effects. By integrative analysis, we found that oleic acid or 
allocholic acid directly binds to α-enolase or farnesoid X receptor-1 in CRC 
cells, respectively, to modulate cancer-associated pathways. Clinically, we 
establish a panel of 17 plasma metabolites that accurately diagnoses CRC in a 
discovery and three validation cohorts (AUC = 0.848-0.987). Overall, we 
characterize metabolite signatures, mechanistic significance, and diagnostic 
potential of plasma and fecal metabolomes in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that trimethylamine N-oxide, a gut 
microbial metabolite of dietary choline and carnitine, promotes both 
cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease risk. It remains unclear how 
circulating concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide and its related dietary and 
gut microbe-derived metabolites (choline, betaine, carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, 
and crotonobetaine) affect incident heart failure (HF).
METHODS: We evaluated 11 768 participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study 
and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with serial measures of 
metabolites. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the 
associations between metabolites and incident HF, adjusted for cardiovascular 
disease risk factors.
RESULTS: In all, 2102 cases of HF occurred over a median follow-up of 15.9 
years. After adjusting for traditional risk factors, higher concentrations of 
trimethylamine N-oxide (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.20]; P<0.001), 
choline (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.26-1.64]; P<0.001), and crotonobetaine 
(hazard ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.16-1.32]; P<0.001) were associated with increased 
risk for incident HF. After further adjustment for renal function (potential 
confounder or mediator), these associations did not reach Bonferroni-corrected 
statistical significance (P=0.01, 0.049, and 0.006, respectively). Betaine and 
carnitine were nominally associated with a higher incidence of HF (P<0.05). In 
exploratory analyses, results were similar for subtypes of HF based on left 
ventricular ejection fraction, and associations appeared generally stronger 
among Black and Hispanic/Latino versus White adults, although there were no 
interactions for any metabolites with race.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pooled analysis of 2 well-phenotyped, diverse, 
community-based cohorts, circulating concentrations of gut microbe-derived 
metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide, choline, and crotonobetaine were 
independently associated with a higher risk of developing HF.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC), particularly for advanced stage of GC, commonly 
undergoes peritoneal metastasis (PM), which is the leading cause of GC-related 
death. However, there currently has no reliable biomarker to predict the onset 
of GCPM. It is well known that the imbalance of gut microbiota contributes to 
the development and metastasis of gastrointestinal tumors. Unfortunately, little 
is known about how the alternation in gut microbiota is associated with the 
onset of GCPM.
METHODS: Our current study analyzed structural characteristics and functional 
prediction of gut microbiota in GC patients with PM (PM group) and without PM 
(non-PM group). Fresh fecal samples were collected from a discovery cohort 
(PM = 38, non-PM = 54) and a validation cohort (PM = 15, non-PM = 21) of GC 
patients and their 16S ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA) gene amplicons were sequenced, 
followed by bioinformatics.
RESULTS: The results indicated an increase in the biodiversity of gut microbiota 
in the non-PM group of the discovery cohort, compared with the PM group. 
Moreover, LEfSe analysis found 31 significantly different microorganisms, of 
which the Roseburia ranked the fifth in the random forest (RF) model. The 
characteristics of intestinal microbiota in GCPM patients were changed, and the 
abundance of Roseburia in gut microbiota from the GCPM patients was reduced and 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the reduced 
abundance of gut Roseburia effectively predicted the onset of GCPM.
CONCLUSION: This signature was also observed in the validation cohort. 
Therefore, Roseburia is a protective microbial marker and the reduced abundance 
of Roseburia in gut microbiota may help early diagnosis of GCPM.

The human gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms, encodes 
diverse metabolic pathways that impact numerous aspects of host physiology. One 
key way in which gut bacteria interact with the host is through the production 
of small metabolites. Several of these microbiota-dependent metabolites, such as 
short-chain fatty acids, have been shown to modulate host diseases. In this 
review, we examine how disease-associated metabolic signatures are identified 
using metabolomic platforms, and where metabolomics is applied in gut 
microbiota-disease interactions. We further explore how integration of 
metagenomic and metabolomic data in human studies can facilitate biomarkers 
discoveries in precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common complication of pregnancy 
that imposes a heavy health and economic burden on individuals, families and 
society. The etiology of PPD is complex and incompletely defined, and recent 
studies have identified an important role for gut microbiota (GM) and their 
metabolites in neurological disorders. However, fewer studies on GM and PPD are 
available and have not yielded uniform results.
METHODS: Instrumental variables for GM and blood metabolites were obtained from 
the MiBioGen consortium and metabolomics GWAS server. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PPD phenotypes were obtained from the 
FinnGen consortium. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted 
mode, and MR-Egger methods were used to assess causal effects. Inverse MR 
analysis and sensitivity analysis were also utilized to improve the stability of 
the results.
RESULTS: In this study, 5 intestinal species and 24 blood metabolites causally 
associated with PPD were identified using MR analysis. In addition, MR analysis 
showed that Prevotellaceae and Bifidobacteria may reduce the risk of PPD by 
elevating Xanthine and 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphoinositol (LysoPI) levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified GM and blood metabolites causally associated 
with PPD. The results of this study may provide a theoretical basis for the 
discovery of PPD-related biomarkers and the treatment of the disease by 
regulating the gut microenvironment.

Intestinal lavage fluid (IVF) containing the mucosa-associated microbiota 
instead of fecal samples was used to study the gut microbiota using different 
omics approaches. Focusing on the 63 IVF samples collected from healthy and 
hepatitis B virus-liver disease (HBV-LD), a question is prompted whether omics 
features could be extracted to distinguish these samples. The IVF-related 
microbiota derived from the omics data was classified into two enterotype sets, 
whereas the genomics-based enterotypes were poorly overlapped with the 
proteomics-based one in either distribution of microbiota or of IVFs. There is 
lack of molecular features in these enterotypes to specifically recognize 
healthy or HBV-LD. Running machine learning against the omics data sought the 
appropriate models to discriminate the healthy and HBV-LD IVFs based on selected 
genes or proteins. Although a single omics dataset is basically workable in such 
discrimination, integration of the two datasets enhances discrimination 
efficiency. The protein features with higher frequencies in the models are 
further compared between healthy and HBV-LD based on their abundance, bringing 
about three potential protein biomarkers. This study highlights that integration 
of metaomics data is beneficial for a molecular discriminator of healthy and 
HBV-LD, and reveals the IVF samples are valuable for microbiome in a small 
cohort.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated the intake of dietary isoflavones in 
relation to obesity risk, whereas the association using objective biomarkers of 
isoflavones, particularly equol (a gut-derived metabolite of daidzein with 
greater bioavailability than other isoflavones) has been less studied. In 
addition, the associations between equol and gut microbiota profile at the 
population level remain to be fully characterized.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify equol-predicting microbial species and to 
investigate the associations of equol-predicting microbial species and urinary 
excretion of isoflavones including glycitein, genistein, daidzein, and equol 
with diverse obesity markers in free living-individuals.
METHODS: In this 1-y longitudinal study of 754 community-dwelling adults, 
urinary isoflavones, fecal microbiota, height, weight, and circumferences of 
waist and hip were measured at baseline and again after 1 y. Liver fat 
[indicated by the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)] and other body 
composition were also measured after 1 y. Linear models and linear mixed-effects 
models were used to analyze the associations for single measure and repeated 
measures, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 305 participants (median age: 50 y, IQR, 37-59 y) including 138 
males and 167 females, higher urinary excretion of equol was associated with 
lower CAP (β = -0.013, P < 0.001) and body fat mass (β= -0.014, P = 0.046). No 
association was found between any other urinary isoflavones and obesity markers 
(all P > 0.05). We identified 21 bacterial genera whose relative abundance were 
positively associated with urinary equol concentrations (all Pfalsediscovery 
rate < 0.05), and constructed an equol-predicting microbial score to reflect the 
overall equol-producing potential of host gut microbiota. This score was 
inversely associated with CAP (β = -0.040, P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: High urinary equol concentrations and equol-predicting microbial 
species could be favorably associated with liver fat and other obesity markers.

BACKGROUND: More than 90% of colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from advanced 
adenomas (AA) and gut microbes are closely associated with the initiation and 
progression of both AA and CRC.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristic microbes in AA.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 92 AA and 184 negative control (NC). 
Illumina HiSeq X sequencing platform was used for high-throughput sequencing of 
microbial populations. The sequencing results were annotated and compared with 
NCBI RefSeq database to find the microbial characteristics of AA. R-vegan 
package was used to analyze α diversity and β diversity. α diversity included 
box diagram, and β diversity included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 
principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA), and non-metric multidimensional scaling 
(NMDS). The AA risk prediction models were constructed based on six kinds of 
machine learning algorithms. In addition, unsupervised clustering methods were 
used to classify bacteria and viruses. Finally, the characteristics of bacteria 
and viruses in different subtypes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The abundance of Prevotella sp900557255, Alistipes putredinis, and 
Megamonas funiformis were higher in AA, while the abundance of Lilyvirus, 
Felixounavirus, and Drulisvirus were also higher in AA. The Catboost based model 
for predicting the risk of AA has the highest accuracy (bacteria test set: 
87.27%; virus test set: 83.33%). In addition, 4 subtypes (B1V1, B1V2, B2V1, and 
B2V2) were distinguished based on the abundance of gut bacteria and 
enteroviruses (EVs). Escherichia coli D, Prevotella sp900557255, CAG-180 
sp000432435, Phocaeicola plebeiuA, Teseptimavirus, Svunavirus, Felixounavirus, 
and Jiaodavirus are the characteristic bacteria and viruses of 4 subtypes. The 
results of Catboost model indicated that the accuracy of prediction improved 
after incorporating subtypes. The accuracy of discovery sets was 100%, 96.34%, 
100%, and 98.46% in 4 subtypes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Prevotella sp900557255 and Felixounavirus have high value in early 
warning of AA. As promising non-invasive biomarkers, gut microbes can become 
potential diagnostic targets for AA, and the accuracy of predicting AA can be 
improved by typing.

The gut microbiome has been recognised as a key component in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and the wide range of metabolites produced by 
gut bacteria are an important mechanism by which the human microbiome interacts 
with host immunity or host metabolism. High-throughput metabolomic profiling and 
novel computational approaches now allow for comprehensive assessment of 
thousands of metabolites in diverse biomaterials, including faecal samples. 
Several groups of metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan 
metabolites and bile acids, have been associated with IBD. In this Recent 
Advances article, we describe the contribution of metabolomics research to the 
field of IBD, with a focus on faecal metabolomics. We discuss the latest 
findings on the significance of these metabolites for IBD prognosis and 
therapeutic interventions and offer insights into the future directions of 
metabolomics research.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer in the world 
and colonic carcinogenesis is a multifactorial disease that involves 
environmental and genetic factors. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in the 
regulation of intestinal homeostasis. Increasing evidence shows that the gut 
microbiome plays a role in CRC development and may be a biomarker for early 
diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the clinical prognostic significance of 
gut microbiota in CRC patients in the Turkish population by metagenomic analysis 
and to determine the microbial composition in tumor tissue biopsy samples.
METHODS: Tissue biopsies were taken from the participants with sterile forceps 
during colonoscopy and stored at -80 °C. Then, DNA isolation was performed from 
the tissue samples and the V3-V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was sequenced on 
the Illumina MiSeq platform. Quality control of the obtained sequence data was 
performed. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified according to the 
Greengenes database. Alpha diversity (Shannon index) and beta diversity 
(Bray-Curtis distance) analyses were performed. The most common bacterial 
species in CRC patients and healthy controls were determined and whether there 
were statistically significant differences between the groups was tested.
RESULTS: A total of 40 individuals, 13 CRC patients and 20 healthy control 
individuals were included in our metagenomic study. The mean age of the patients 
was 64.83 and BMI was 25.85. In CRC patients, the level of Bacteroidetes at the 
phylum taxonomy was significantly increased (p = 0.04), the level of Clostridia 
at the class taxonomy was increased (p = 0.23), and the level of Enterococcus at 
the genus taxonomy was significantly increased (p = 0.01). When CRC patients 
were compared with the control group, significant increases were detected in the 
species of Gemmiger formicilis (p = 0.15), Prevotella copri (p = 0.02) and 
Ruminococcus bromii (p = 0.001) at the species taxonomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota composition in CRC 
patients provides important data for determining the treatment options for these 
patients. The results of this study suggest that it may be beneficial in terms 
of early diagnosis, poor prognosis and survival rates in CRC patients. In 
addition, this metagenomic study is the first study on the colon microbiome 
associated with CRC mucosa in the Turkish population.

Biliary tract neoplasms, which originate from the intrahepatic or extrahepatic 
biliary epithelium, are relatively rare but diagnostically challenging types of 
tumours, and their morbidity and mortality have increased in recent years. Due 
to ineffective early diagnostic methods, once detected, patients are in an 
advanced stage with a poor prognosis and few treatment options. With the 
development of omics technologies, the associations between microorganisms, bile 
acid and salts, noncoding RNAs and biliary tract malignancies have been 
gradually revealed, providing new methods for the discovery of diagnostic 
biomarkers. Here, we review the research advances in microbiomics, 
transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics in the discovery of diagnostic 
biomarkers for biliary tract malignancies.

BACKGROUND: Personalized nutrition (PN) has been proposed as a strategy to 
increase the effectiveness of dietary recommendations and ultimately improve 
health status.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether including omics-based PN in an e-commerce 
tool improves dietary behavior and metabolic profile in general population.
METHODS: A 21-wk parallel, single-blinded, randomized intervention involved 193 
adults assigned to a control group following Mediterranean diet recommendations 
(n = 57, completers = 36), PN (n = 70, completers = 45), or personalized plan 
(PP, n = 68, completers = 53) integrating a behavioral change program with PN 
recommendations. The intervention used metabolomics, proteomics, and genetic 
data to assist participants in creating personalized shopping lists in a 
simulated e-commerce retailer portal. The primary outcome was the Mediterranean 
diet adherence screener (MEDAS) score; secondary outcomes included biometric and 
metabolic markers and dietary habits.
RESULTS: Volunteers were categorized with a scoring system based on biomarkers 
of lipid, carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
microbiota, and dietary recommendations delivered accordingly in the PN and PP 
groups. The intervention significantly increased MEDAS scores in all volunteers 
(control-3 points; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2, 3.8; PN-2.7 points; 95% 
CI: 2.0, 3.3; and PP-2.8 points; 95% CI: 2.1, 3.4; q < 0.001). No significant 
differences were observed in dietary habits or health parameters between PN and 
control groups after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, 
personalized recommendations significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and 
selectively enhanced the scores calculated with biomarkers of carbohydrate 
metabolism (β: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.18), oxidative stress (β: -0.37; 95% CI: 
-0.60, -0.15), microbiota (β: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.63, -0.15), and inflammation (β: 
-0.78; 95% CI: -1.24, -0.31) compared with control diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of personalized strategies within an e-commerce-like 
tool did not enhance adherence to Mediterranean diet or improved health markers 
compared with general recommendations. The metabotyping approach showed 
promising results and more research is guaranteed to further promote its 
application in PN. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 
NCT04641559 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04641559?cond=NCT04641559&rank=1).

BACKGROUND: The association between soy isoflavones intake and cardiometabolic 
health remains inconclusive. We investigated the associations of urinary 
biomarkers of isoflavones including daidzein, glycitein, genistein, equol (a gut 
microbial metabolite of daidzein), and equol-predicting microbial species with 
cardiometabolic risk markers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a 1-year study of 305 Chinese community-dwelling adults 
aged ≥18 years, urinary isoflavones, fecal microbiota, blood pressure, blood 
glucose and lipids, and anthropometric data were measured twice, 1 year apart. 
Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was also measured after 1 year. A linear 
mixed-effects model was used to analyze repeated measurements. Logistic 
regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI for 
the associations for arterial stiffness. Each 1 μg/g creatinine increase in 
urinary equol concentrations was associated with 1.47%, 0.96%, and 3.32% 
decrease in triglycerides, plasma atherogenic index, and metabolic syndrome 
score, respectively (all P<0.05), and 0.61% increase in high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (P=0.025). Urinary equol was also associated with lower risk of 
arterial stiffness (aOR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.09-0.90]; Ptrend=0.036). We identified 
21 bacterial genera whose relative abundance was positively associated with 
urinary equol (false discovery rate-corrected P<0.05) and constructed a 
microbial species score to reflect the overall equol-predicting capacity. This 
score (per 1-point increase) was inversely associated with triglycerides 
(percentage difference=-1.48%), plasma atherogenic index (percentage 
difference=-0.85%), and the risk of arterial stiffness (aOR, 0.27 [95% CI, 
0.08-0.88]; all P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary equol and equol-predicting 
microbial species may improve cardiometabolic risk parameters in Chinese adults.

In this study, we investigated the correlation between the composition and 
function of the gut microbiota and the semen quality of Rongchang boars. 
Significant differences in gut microbial composition between boars with high 
(group H) and low (group L) semen utilization rates were identified through 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing, with 18 differential microbes observed at the genus level. 
Boars with lower semen utilization rates exhibited a higher relative abundance 
of Treponema, suggesting its potential role in reducing semen quality. 
Conversely, boars with higher semen utilization rates showed increased relative 
abundances of Terrisporobacter, Turicibacter, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium 
sensu stricto 3, and Bifidobacterium, with Stenotrophomonas and Clostridium 
sensu stricto 3 showing a significant positive correlation with semen 
utilization rates. The metabolomic analyses revealed higher levels of 
gluconolactone, D-ribose, and 4-pyridoxic acid in the H group, with 4 pyridoxic 
acid and D-ribose showing a significant positive correlation with 
Terrisporobacter and Clostridium sensu stricto 3, respectively. In contrast, the 
L group showed elevated levels of D-erythrose-4-phosphate, which correlated 
negatively with Bifidobacterium and Clostridium sensu stricto 3. These 
differential metabolites were enriched in the pentose phosphate pathway, vitamin 
B6 metabolism, and antifolate resistance, potentially influencing semen quality. 
These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between the gut 
microbiota and boar reproductive health and may offer important information for 
the discovery of disease biomarkers and reproductive health management.

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, results in respiratory and cardiopulmonary 
infections. There is an urgent need to understand not just the pathogenic 
mechanisms of this disease but also its impact on the physiology of different 
organs and microbiomes. Multiple studies have reported the effects of COVID-19 
on the gastrointestinal microbiota, such as promoting dysbiosis (imbalances in 
the microbiome) following the disease's progression. Deconstructing the dynamic 
changes in microbiome composition that are specifically correlated with COVID-19 
patients remains a challenge. Motivated by this problem, we implemented a 
biomarker discovery pipeline to identify candidate microbes specific to 
COVID-19. This involved a meta-analysis of large-scale COVID-19 metagenomic data 
to decipher the impact of COVID-19 on the human gut and respiratory microbiomes. 
Metagenomic studies of the gut and respiratory microbiomes of COVID-19 patients 
and of microbiomes from other respiratory diseases with symptoms similar to or 
overlapping with COVID-19 revealed 1169 and 131 differentially abundant microbes 
in the human gut and respiratory microbiomes, respectively, that uniquely 
associate with COVID-19. Furthermore, by utilizing machine learning models 
(LASSO and XGBoost), we demonstrated the power of microbial features in 
separating COVID-19 samples from metagenomic samples representing other 
respiratory diseases and controls (healthy individuals), achieving an overall 
accuracy of over 80%. Overall, our study provides insights into the microbiome 
shifts occurring in COVID-19 patients, shining a new light on the compositional 
changes.

Gut bacteria are implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the strains 
driving these associations are unknown. Large-scale studies of microbiome 
evolution could reveal the imprint of disease on gut bacteria, thus pinpointing 
the strains and genes that may underlie inflammation. Here, we use stool 
metagenomes of thousands of IBD patients and healthy controls to reconstruct 
140,000 strain genotypes, revealing hundreds of lineages enriched in IBD. We 
demonstrate that these strains are ancient, taxonomically diverse, and 
ubiquitous in humans. Moreover, disease-associated strains outcompete their 
healthy counterparts during inflammation, implying long-term adaptation to 
disease. Strain genetic differences map onto known axes of inflammation, 
including oxidative stress, nutrient biosynthesis, and immune evasion. Lastly, 
the loss of health-associated strains of Eggerthella lenta was predictive of 
fecal calprotectin, a biomarker of disease severity. Our work identifies 
reservoirs of strain diversity that may impact inflammatory disease and can be 
extended to other microbiome-associated diseases.

The influence of gut microbiota on membranous nephropathy: A two-sample 
Mendelian randomization study.

Wu Q, Zheng T, Xie S, Zhu J, Yuan L, Wei W, Lyu N.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic approaches that target the gut microbiota may be helpful 
in the potential prevention and treatment of membranous nephropathy (MN). 
Several studies demonstrated a correlation between gut microbiota and MN. 
However, the confounding evidence cannot prove a causal relationship between gut 
microbiota and MN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of our study is to assess genome-wide association 
study data for a causal relationship between gut microbiota and MN using a 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Inverse variance weighted 
(IVW) was used as the primary technique to determine the association of genetic 
variants from gut microbiota and MN patients. Besides, sensitivity analyses 
conﬁrmed the accuracy of the results. Finally, we applied false discovery rate 
(FDR) correction to results with IVW < 0.05 during multiple hypothesis testing.
RESULTS: The results from IVW estimates indicated that Bacillales exhibited a 
significant association with MN, acting as a risk factor (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 
1.14 - 2.02, p = 0.005). In addition, our univariable MR results showed that 7 
bacterial taxa (Melainabacteria, Butyricicoccus, Catenibacterium, 
Ruminiclostridium5, RuminococcaceaeUCG003, RuminococcaceaeUCG013, and 
Gastranaerophilales) had suggestive associations with MN. The sensitivity 
analysis did not reveal any significant heterogeneity in the instrumental 
variables or horizontal pleiotropy.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provided causal evidence for the effect of gut 
microbiota on MN patients and broadened the spectrum of bacterial taxa that 
might be involved in the pathogenesis of MN. These selected bacterial taxa hold 
promise as new biomarkers, which may aid in designing targeted therapeutic 
modalities for MN, improving our comprehension of the gut-kidney axis.

The existence of microbiome in human tumors has been determined widely, but 
evaluating the contribution of intratumoral bacteria and fungi to tumor immunity 
and prognosis from a pan-cancer perspective remains absent. We designed an 
improved microbial analysis pipeline to reduce interference from host sequences, 
complemented with integration analysis of intratumoral microbiota at species 
level with clinical indicators, tumor microenvironment, and prognosis across 
cancer types. We found that intratumoral microbiota is associated with 
immunophenotyping, with high-immunity subtypes showing greater bacterial and 
fungal richness compared to low-immunity groups. We also noted that the 
combination of fungi and bacteria demonstrated promising prognostic value across 
cancer types. We, thus, present The Cancer Microbiota (TCMbio), an interactive 
platform that provides the intratumoral bacteria and fungi data, and a 
comprehensive analysis module for 33 types of cancers. This led to the discovery 
of clinical and prognostic significance of intratumoral microbes.

Asthma is a leading worldwide biomedical concern. Patients can experience 
life-threatening worsening episodes (exacerbations) usually controlled by 
anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator drugs. However, substantial heterogeneity 
in treatment response exists, and a subset of patients with unresolved asthma 
carry the major burden of this disease. The study of the epigenome and 
microbiome might bridge the gap between human genetics and environmental 
exposure to partially explain the heterogeneity in drug response. This review 
aims to provide a critical examination of the existing literature on the 
microbiome and epigenetic studies examining associations with asthma treatments 
and drug response, highlight convergent pathways, address current challenges, 
and offer future perspectives. Current epigenetic and microbiome studies have 
shown the bilateral relationship between asthma pharmacologic interventions and 
the human epigenome and microbiome. These studies, focusing on corticosteroids 
and to a lesser extent on bronchodilators, azithromycin, immunotherapy, and 
mepolizumab, have improved the understanding of the molecular basis of treatment 
response and identified promising biomarkers for drug response prediction. 
Immune and inflammatory pathways (eg, IL-2, TNF-α, NF-κB, and C/EBPs) underlie 
microbiome-epigenetic associations with asthma treatment, representing potential 
therapeutic pathways to be targeted. A comprehensive evaluation of these omics 
biomarkers could significantly contribute to precision medicine and new 
therapeutic target discovery.

Our skin protects us from external threats including ultraviolet radiation, 
pathogens and chemicals, and prevents excessive trans-epidermal water loss. 
These varied activities are reliant on a vast array of lipids, many of which are 
unique to skin, and that support physical, microbiological and immunological 
barriers. The cutaneous physical barrier is dependent on a specific lipid matrix 
that surrounds terminally-differentiated keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. 
Sebum- and keratinocyte-derived lipids cover the skin's surface and support and 
regulate the skin microbiota. Meanwhile, lipids signal between resident and 
infiltrating cutaneous immune cells, driving inflammation and its resolution in 
response to pathogens and other threats. Lipids of particular importance include 
ceramides, which are crucial for stratum corneum lipid matrix formation and 
therefore physical barrier functionality, fatty acids, which contribute to the 
acidic pH of the skin surface and regulate the microbiota, as well as the 
stratum corneum lipid matrix, and bioactive metabolites of these fatty acids, 
involved in cell signalling, inflammation, and numerous other cutaneous 
processes. These diverse and complex lipids maintain homeostasis in healthy 
skin, and are implicated in many cutaneous diseases, as well as unrelated 
systemic conditions with skin manifestations, and processes such as ageing. 
Lipids also contribute to the gut-skin axis, signalling between the two barrier 
sites. Therefore, skin lipids provide a valuable resource for exploration of 
healthy cutaneous processes, local and systemic disease development and 
progression, and accessible biomarker discovery for systemic disease, as well as 
an opportunity to fully understand the relationship between the host and the 
skin microbiota. Investigation of skin lipids could provide diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers, and help identify new targets for interventions. 
Development and improvement of existing in vitro and in silico approaches to 
explore the cutaneous lipidome, as well as advances in skin lipidomics 
technologies, will facilitate ongoing progress in skin lipid research.

Aims: Plant-derived lignans may protect against obesity, while their bioactivity 
needs gut microbial conversion to enterolignans. We used repeated measures to 
identify enterolignan-predicting microbial species and investigate whether 
enterolignans and enterolignan-predicting microbial species are associated with 
obesity. Methods: Urinary enterolignans, fecal microbiota, body weight, height, 
and circumferences of the waist (WC) and hips (HC) were repeatedly measured at 
the baseline and after 1 year in 305 community-dwelling adults in Huoshan, 
China. Body composition and liver fat [indicated by the controlled attenuation 
parameter (CAP)] were measured after 1 year. Multivariate-adjusted linear models 
and linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze single and repeated 
measurements, respectively. Results: Enterolactone and enterodiol levels were 
both inversely associated with the waist-to-hip ratio, body fat mass (BFM), 
visceral fat level (VFL), and liver fat accumulation (all P < 0.05). 
Enterolactone levels were also associated with lower WC (β = -0.0035 and P = 
0.013) and HC (β = -0.0028 and P = 0.044). We identified multiple bacterial 
genera whose relative abundance was positively associated with the levels of 
enterolactone (26 genera) and enterodiol (22 genera, all P false discovery rate 
< 0.05), and constructed the enterolactone-predicting microbial score and 
enterodiol-predicting microbial score to reflect the overall 
enterolignan-producing potential of the host gut microbiota. Both these scores 
were associated with lower body weight and CAP (all P < 0.05). The 
enterolactone-predicting microbial score was also inversely associated with the 
BFM (β = -0.1128 and P = 0.027) and VFL (β = -0.1265 and P = 0.044). Conclusion: 
Our findings support that modulating the host gut microbiome could be a 
potential strategy to prevent obesity by enhancing the production of 
enterolignans.

Schistosome infection and schistosome-derived products have been implicated in 
the prevention and alleviation of inflammatory bowel disease by manipulating the 
host immune response, whereas the role of gut microbiota in this protective 
effect remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the 
intraperitoneal immunization with Schistosoma japonicum eggs prior to dextran 
sulfate sodium (DSS) application significantly ameliorated the symptoms of 
DSS-induced acute colitis, which was characterized by higher body weight, lower 
disease activity index score and macroscopic inflammatory scores. We 
demonstrated that the immunomodulatory effects of S. japonicum eggs were 
accompanied by an influence on gut microbiota composition, abundance, and 
diversity, which increased the abundance of genus Turicibacter, family 
Erysipelotrichaceae, phylum Firmicutes, and decreased the abundance of genus 
Odoribacter, family Marinifilaceae, order Bacteroidales, class Bacteroidia, 
phylum Bacteroidota. In addition, Lactobacillus was identified as a biomarker 
that distinguishes healthy control mice from DSS-induced colitis mice. The 
present study revealed the importance of the gut microbiota in S. japonicum eggs 
exerting protective effects in an experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) model, 
providing an alternative strategy for the discovery of UC prevention and 
treatment drugs.

concern due to their high toxicity and inhibition of important biogeochemical 
processes such as methanogenesis. Anaerobic biotransformation of CF and DCM has 
been well documented but typically independently of one another. CF is the 
electron acceptor for certain organohalide-respiring bacteria that use reductive 
dehalogenases (RDases) to dechlorinate CF to DCM. In contrast, known DCM 
degraders use DCM as their electron donor, which is oxidized using a series of 
methyltransferases and associated proteins encoded by the mec cassette to 
facilitate the entry of DCM to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The SC05 culture is 
an enrichment culture sold commercially for bioaugmentation, which transforms CF 
via DCM to CO2. This culture has the unique ability to dechlorinate CF to DCM 
using electron equivalents provided by the oxidation of DCM to CO2. Here, we use 
metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses to identify the functional genes involved 
in each of these transformations. Though 91 metagenome-assembled genomes were 
assembled, the genes for an RDase-named acdA-and a complete mec cassette were 
found to be encoded on a single contig belonging to Dehalobacter. AcdA and 
critical Mec proteins were also highly expressed by the culture. Heterologously 
expressed AcdA dechlorinated CF and other chloroalkanes but had 100-fold lower 
activity on DCM. Overall, the high expression of Mec proteins and the activity 
of AcdA suggest a Dehalobacter capable of dechlorination of CF to DCM and 
subsequent mineralization of DCM using the mec cassette.
IMPORTANCE: Chloroform (CF) and dichloromethane (DCM) are regulated groundwater 
contaminants. A cost-effective approach to remove these pollutants from 
contaminated groundwater is to employ microbes that transform CF and DCM as part 
of their metabolism, thus depleting the contamination as the microbes continue 
to grow. In this work, we investigate bioaugmentation culture SC05, a mixed 
microbial consortium that effectively and simultaneously degrades both CF and 
DCM coupled to the growth of Dehalobacter. We identified the functional genes 
responsible for the transformation of CF and DCM in SC05. These genetic 
biomarkers provide a means to monitor the remediation process in the field.

Recent advances in cancer research have unveiled a significant yet previously 
underappreciated aspect of oncology: the presence and role of intratumoral 
microbiota. These microbial residents, encompassing bacteria, fungi, and viruses 
within tumor tissues, have been found to exert considerable influence on tumor 
development, progression, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. This 
review aims to synthesize these groundbreaking discoveries, providing an 
integrated overview of the identification, characterization, and functional 
roles of intratumoral microbiota in cancer biology. We focus on elucidating the 
complex interactions between these microorganisms and the tumor 
microenvironment, highlighting their potential as novel biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets. The purpose of this review is to offer a comprehensive 
understanding of the microbial dimension in cancer, paving the way for 
innovative approaches in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AIM: Our study focuses on the microbial and metabolomic profile changes during 
the adenoma stage, as adenomas can be considered potential precursors to 
colorectal cancer through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Identifying possible 
intervention targets at this stage may aid in preventing the progression of 
colorectal adenoma (CRA) to malignant lesions. Furthermore, we evaluate the 
efficacy of combined microbial and metabolite biomarkers in detecting CRA.
METHODS: Fecal metagenomic and serum metabolomic analyses were performed for the 
discovery of alterations of gut microbiome and metabolites in CRA patients 
(n = 26), Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (n = 19), Familial Adenomatous 
Polyposis (FAP) patients (n = 10), and healthy controls (n = 20). Finally, 
analyzing the associations between gut microbes and metabolites was performed by 
a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: Our analysis present that CRA patients differ significantly in gut 
microflora and serum metabolites compared with healthy controls, especially for 
Lachnospiraceae and Parasutterella. Its main metabolite, butyric acid, 
concentrations were raised in CRA patients compared with the healthy controls, 
indicating its role as a promoter of colorectal tumorigenesis. α-Linolenic acid 
and lysophosphatidylcholine represented the other healthy metabolite for CRA. 
Combining five microbial and five metabolite biomarkers, we differentiated CRA 
from CRC with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85 out of this performance 
vastly superior to the specificity recorded by traditional markers CEA and CA199 
in such differentiation of these conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines significant microbial and metabolic 
alterations in CRA with a novel insight into screening and early intervention of 
its tumorigenesis.

SCOPE: Little is known about the effect of blood vitamin D status on the gut 
mycobiota (i.e., fungi), a crucial component of the gut microbial ecosystem. The 
study aims to explore the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 
gut mycobiota and to investigate the link between the identified mycobial 
features and blood glycemic traits.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study examines the association between serum 25(OH)D 
levels and the gut mycobiota in the Westlake Precision Birth Cohort, which 
includes pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The study 
develops a genetic risk score (GRS) for 25(OH)D to validate the observational 
results. In both the prospective and cross-sectional analyses, the vitamin D is 
associated with gut mycobiota diversity. Specifically, the abundance of 
Saccharomyces is significantly lower in the vitamin D-sufficient group than in 
the vitamin D-deficient group. The GRS of 25(OH)D is inversely associated with 
the abundance of Saccharomyces. Moreover, the Saccharomyces is positively 
associated with blood glucose levels.
CONCLUSION: Blood vitamin D status is associated with the diversity and 
composition of gut mycobiota in women with GDM, which may provide new insights 
into the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between vitamin D levels 
and metabolic health.

The human gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms, 
that influence metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune pathways. Microbial 
dysbiosis, characterized by changes in microbial diversity and relative 
abundances, is implicated in the development of various chronic neurological and 
neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders are marked by the accumulation of 
pathological protein aggregates, leading to the progressive loss of neurons and 
behavioural functions. Dysregulations in protein-protein interaction networks 
and signalling complexes, critical for normal brain function, are common in 
neurological disorders but challenging to unravel, particularly at the neuron 
and synapse-specific levels. To advance therapeutic strategies, a deeper 
understanding of neuropathogenesis, especially during the progressive disease 
phase, is needed. Biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying disease 
pathophysiology and monitoring disease progression. Proteomics, a powerful 
technology, shows promise in accelerating biomarker discovery and aiding in the 
development of novel treatments. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth 
overview of how proteomic techniques, utilizing various biofluid samples from 
patients with neurological conditions and diverse animal models, have 
contributed valuable insights into the pathogenesis of numerous neurological 
disorders. We also discuss the current state of research, potential challenges, 
and future directions in proteomic approaches to unravel neuro-pathological 
conditions.

The pathogenesis of chronic wounds (CW) involves a multifaceted interplay of 
biochemical, immunological, hematological, and microbiological interactions. 
Biofilm development is a significant virulence trait which enhances microbial 
survival and pathogenicity and has various implications on the development and 
management of CW. Biofilms induce a prolonged suboptimal inflammation in the 
wound microenvironment, associated with delayed healing. The composition of 
wound fluid (WF) adds more complexity to the subject, with proven 
pro-inflammatory properties and an intricate crosstalk among cytokines, 
chemokines, microRNAs, proteases, growth factors, and ECM components. One 
approach to achieve information on the mechanisms of disease progression and 
therapeutic response is the use of multiple high-throughput 'OMIC' modalities 
(genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic assays), facilitating the discovery 
of potential biomarkers for wound healing, which may represent a breakthrough in 
this field and a major help in addressing delayed wound healing. In this review 
article, we aim to summarize the current progress achieved in host-microbiome 
crosstalk in the spectrum of CW healing and highlight future innovative 
strategies to boost the host immune response against infections, focusing on the 
interaction between pathogens and their hosts (for instance, by harnessing 
microorganisms like probiotics), which may serve as the prospective advancement 
of vaccines and treatments against infections.

The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be correlated with the clinical 
phenotypes of diseases, including cancers. However, there are few studies on 
clinical subtyping based on the gut microbiota, especially in breast cancer (BC) 
patients. Here, using machine learning methods, we analysed the gut microbiota 
of BC, colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC) patients to identify 
their shared metabolic pathways and the importance of these pathways in cancer 
development. Based on the gut microbiota-related metabolic pathways, human gene 
expression profile and patient prognosis, we established a novel BC subtyping 
system and identified a subtype called "challenging BC". Tumours with this 
subtype have more genetic mutations and a more complex immune environment than 
those of other subtypes. A score index was proposed for in-depth analysis and 
showed a significant negative correlation with patient prognosis. Notably, 
activation of the TPK1-FOXP3-mediated Hedgehog signalling pathway and 
TPK1-ITGAE-mediated mTOR signalling pathway was linked to poor prognosis in 
"challenging BC" patients with high scores, as validated in a patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, our subtyping system and score index are 
effective predictors of the response to current neoadjuvant therapy regimens, 
with the score index significantly negatively correlated with both treatment 
efficacy and the number of immune cells. Therefore, our findings provide 
valuable insights into predicting molecular characteristics and treatment 
responses in "challenging BC" patients.

OBJECTIVE: In premenopausal individuals, vaginal microbiota diversity and lack 
of Lactobacillus dominance are associated with greater mucosal inflammation, 
which is linked to a higher risk of cervical dysplasia and infections. It is not 
known if the association between the vaginal microbiota and inflammation is 
present after menopause, when the vaginal microbiota is generally 
higher-diversity and fewer people have Lactobacillus dominance.
METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of a subset of postmenopausal individuals 
enrolled in a randomized trial for treatment of moderate-severe vulvovaginal 
discomfort that compared vaginal moisturizer, estradiol, or placebo. Vaginal 
fluid samples from 0, 4, and 12 weeks were characterized using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing (microbiota) and MesoScale Discovery (vaginal fluid immune markers: 
IL-1b, IL-1a, IL-2, IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, IL-9, IL-13, IL-8, IP10, MIP1a, MIP1b, 
MIP3a). Global associations between cytokines and microbiota (assessed by 
relative abundance of individual taxa and Shannon index for alpha, or community, 
diversity) were explored, adjusting for treatment arm, using linear mixed 
models, principal component analysis, and Generalized Linear Mixed Model + 
Microbiome Regression-based Kernel Association Test (GLMM-MiRKAT).
RESULTS: A total of 119 individuals with mean age of 61 years were included. At 
baseline, 29.5% of participants had a Lactobacillus -dominant vaginal 
microbiota. Across all timepoints, alpha diversity (Shannon index, P = 0.003) 
was highly associated with immune markers. Individual markers that were 
associated with Lactobacillus dominance were similar to those observed in 
premenopausal people: IL-10, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 (false discovery rate [FDR] < 
0.01), IL-13 (FDR = 0.02), and IL-2 (FDR = 0.09). Over 12 weeks, change in alpha 
diversity was associated with change in cytokine concentration (Shannon, P = 
0.018), with decreased proinflammatory cytokine concentrations observed with 
decreasing alpha diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of postmenopausal individuals, Lactobacillus 
dominance and lower alpha diversity were associated with lower concentrations of 
inflammatory immune markers, as has been reported in premenopausal people. This 
suggests that after menopause lactobacilli continue to have beneficial effects 
on vaginal immune homeostasis, despite lower prevalence.

BACKGROUND: The role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis 
(UC) has been increasingly recognized. However, most of the reports are from 
Western populations. In Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, little 
is known about the role of microbiota. Therefore, our aim was to describe the 
bacterial microbiota profile and signature in pediatric UC in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: Twenty children with UC and 20 healthy controls enrolled in the study 
gave stool samples. Twenty rectal mucosal samples were taken from UC and 20 from 
non-UC controls. Inclusion criteria included newly diagnosed and untreated 
children and lack of antibiotic exposure for at least 6 months before stool 
collection was required for children with UC and controls. Bacterial 
deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted and sequenced using shotgun metagenomic 
analysis. Statistical analysis included Shannon alpha diversity metrics, 
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, DESeq2, and biomarker discovery.
RESULTS: The demographic characteristics were similar in children with UC and 
controls. There was a significant reduction in alpha diversity (P = 0.037) and 
beta diversity in samples from children with UC (P = 0.001). Many taxa were 
identified with log2 abundance analysis, revealing 110 and 102 species 
significantly depleted and enriched in UC, respectively. Eleven bacterial 
species' signatures were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: In Saudi Arabian children with UC, we demonstrate a dysbiosis 
similar to reports from Western populations, possibly related to changes of 
lifestyle. Microbial signature discovery in this report is an important 
contribution to research, leading to the development of adjunctive non-invasive 
diagnostic options in unusual cases of UC.

Despite substantial progress in cancer microbiome research, recognized 
confounders and advances in absolute microbiome quantification remain underused; 
this raises concerns regarding potential spurious associations. Here we study 
the fecal microbiota of 589 patients at different colorectal cancer (CRC) stages 
and compare observations with up to 15 published studies (4,439 patients and 
controls total). Using quantitative microbiome profiling based on 16S ribosomal 
RNA amplicon sequencing, combined with rigorous confounder control, we 
identified transit time, fecal calprotectin (intestinal inflammation) and body 
mass index as primary microbial covariates, superseding variance explained by 
CRC diagnostic groups. Well-established microbiome CRC targets, such as 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, did not significantly associate with CRC diagnostic 
groups (healthy, adenoma and carcinoma) when controlling for these covariates. 
In contrast, the associations of Anaerococcus vaginalis, Dialister pneumosintes, 
Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica 
and Prevotella intermedia remained robust, highlighting their future target 
potential. Finally, control individuals (age 22-80 years, mean 57.7 years, 
standard deviation 11.3) meeting criteria for colonoscopy (for example, through 
a positive fecal immunochemical test) but without colonic lesions are enriched 
for the dysbiotic Bacteroides2 enterotype, emphasizing uncertainties in defining 
healthy controls in cancer microbiome research. Together, these results indicate 
the importance of quantitative microbiome profiling and covariate control for 
biomarker identification in CRC microbiome studies.

INTRODUCTION: The potential role of the endometrial microbiota in the 
pathogenesis of endometrial polyps (EPs) warrants further investigation, given 
the current landscape of limited and inconclusive research findings. We aimed to 
explore the microecological characteristics of the uterine cavity in patients 
with EPs and investigate the potential of endometrial microbiota species as 
novel biomarkers for identifying EPs.
METHODS: Endometrial samples were collected from 225 patients who underwent 
hysteroscopies, of whom 167 had EPs, whereas 58 had non- hyperproliferative 
endometrium status. The endometrial microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. We characterized the endometrial microbiota and identified microbial 
biomarkers for predicting EPs.
RESULTS: The endometrial microbial diversity and composition were significantly 
different between the EP and control groups. Predictive functional analyses of 
the endometrial microbiota demonstrated significant alterations in pathways 
involved in sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and apoptosis 
between the two groups. Moreover, a classification model based on endometrial 
microbial ASV-based biomarkers along with the presence of abnormal uterine 
bleeding symptoms achieved powerful classification potential in identifying EPs 
in both the discovery and validation cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates a potential association between altered 
endometrial microbiota and EPs. Endometrial microbiota-based biomarkers may 
prove valuable for the diagnosis of EPs.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an untreatable and clinically 
heterogeneous condition primarily affecting motor neurons. The ongoing quest for 
reliable biomarkers that mirror the disease status and progression has led to 
investigations that extend beyond motor neurons' pathology, encompassing broader 
systemic factors such as metabolism, immunity, and the microbiome. Our study 
contributes to this effort by examining the potential role of microbiome-related 
components, including viral elements, such as torque tenovirus (TTV), and 
various inflammatory factors, in ALS. In our analysis of serum samples from 100 
ALS patients and 34 healthy controls (HC), we evaluated 14 cytokines, TTV DNA 
load, and 18 free fatty acids (FFA). We found that the evaluated variables are 
effective in differentiating ALS patients from healthy controls. In addition, 
our research identifies four unique patient clusters, each characterized by 
distinct biological profiles. Intriguingly, no correlations were found with site 
of onset, sex, progression rate, phenotype, or C9ORF72 expansion. A remarkable 
aspect of our findings is the discovery of a gender-specific relationship 
between levels of 2-ethylhexanoic acid and patient survival. In addition to 
contributing to the growing body of evidence suggesting altered peripheral 
immune responses in ALS, our exploratory research underscores metabolic 
diversity challenging conventional clinical classifications. If our exploratory 
findings are validated by further research, they could significantly impact 
disease understanding and patient care customization. Identifying groups based 
on biological profiles might aid in clustering patients with varying responses 
to treatments.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly recognized for its 
global prevalence and potential progression to more severe liver diseases such 
as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role 
in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, yet the detailed characteristics and ecological 
alterations of gut microbial communities during the progression from 
non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH remain poorly understood. Methods: In 
this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of gut microbiota composition in 
individuals with NAFL and NASH to elucidate differences and characteristics. We 
utilized 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the intestinal gut microbiota among a 
healthy control group (65 cases), NAFL group (64 cases), and NASH group (53 
cases). Random forest machine learning and database validation methods were 
employed to analyze the data. Results: Our findings indicate a significant 
decrease in the diversity of intestinal flora during the progression of NAFLD 
(p < 0.05). At the phylum level, high abundances of Bacteroidetes and 
Fusobacteria were observed in both NAFL and NASH patients, whereas Firmicutes 
were less abundant. At the genus level, a significant decrease in Prevotella 
expression was seen in the NAFL group (AUC 0.738), whereas an increase in the 
combination of Megamonas and Fusobacterium was noted in the NASH group (AUC 
0.769). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis highlighted significant disturbances 
in various types of glucose metabolism pathways in the NASH group compared to 
the NAFL group, as well as notably compromised flavonoid and flavonol 
biosynthesis functions. The study uncovers distinct microbiota characteristics 
and microecological changes within the gut during the transition from NAFL to 
NASH, providing insights that could facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.

The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a novel dietary index for gut 
microbiota (DI-GM) that captures dietary composition related to gut microbiota 
profiles. We conducted a literature review of longitudinal studies on the 
association of diet with gut microbiota in adult populations and extracted those 
dietary components with evidence of beneficial or unfavorable effects. Dietary 
recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 
2005-2010, n = 3812) were used to compute the DI-GM, and associations with 
biomarkers of gut microbiota diversity (urinary enterodiol and enterolactone) 
were examined using linear regression. From a review of 106 articles, 14 foods 
or nutrients were identified as components of the DI-GM, including fermented 
dairy, chickpeas, soybean, whole grains, fiber, cranberries, avocados, broccoli, 
coffee, and green tea as beneficial components, and red meat, processed meat, 
refined grains, and high-fat diet (≥40% of energy from fat) as unfavorable 
components. Each component was scored 0 or 1 based on sex-specific median 
intakes, and scores were summed to develop the overall DI-GM score. In the 
NHANES, DI-GM scores ranged from 0-13 with a mean of 4.8 (SE = 0.04). Positive 
associations between DI-GM and urinary enterodiol and enterolactone were 
observed. The association of the novel DI-GM with markers of gut microbiota 
diversity demonstrates the potential utility of this index for gut 
health-related studies.

Liver metastasis is a major cause of mortality in patients with advanced stages 
of colorectal cancer (CRC). The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to 
influence the progression of liver diseases, potentially providing novel 
perspectives for diagnosis, treatment and research. However, the gut microbial 
characteristics in CRC with liver metastasis (LM) and with no liver metastasis 
(NLM) have not yet been fully established. In the present study, high-throughput 
16S RNA sequencing technology was employed, in order to examine the gut 
microbial richness and composition in patients with CRC with LM or NLM. A 
discovery cohort (cohort 2; LM=18; NLM=36) and a validation cohort (cohort 3; 
LM=13; NLM=41) were established using fresh feces. In addition, primary 
carcinoma tissue samples were also analyzed (LM=8 and NLM=10) as a supplementary 
discovery cohort (cohort 1). The findings of the present study indicated that 
the intestinal microbiota richness and diversity were increased in the LM group 
as compared to the NLM group. A significant difference was observed in species 
composition between the LM and NLM group. In the two discovery cohorts with two 
different samples, the dominant phyla were consistent, but varied at lower 
taxonomic levels. Phylum Fusobacteria presented consistent and significant 
enrichment in LM group in both discovery cohorts. Furthermore, with the 
application of a random forest model and receiver operator characteristic curve 
analysis, Fusobacteria was identified as a potential biomarker for LM. Moreover, 
Fusobacteria was also a poor prognosis factor for survival. Importantly, the 
findings were reconfirmed in the validation cohort. On the whole, the findings 
of the present study demonstrated that CRC with LM and NLM exhibit distinct gut 
microbiota characteristics. Fusobacteria detection thus has potential for use in 
predicting LM and a poor prognosis of patients with CRC.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a predominant driver of coronary artery disease 
worldwide. This study aims to unravel the distinct characteristics of oral and 
gut microbiota in diabetic coronary heart disease (DCHD). Simultaneously, we aim 
to establish a causal link between the diabetes-driven oral-gut microbiota axis 
and increased susceptibility to diabetic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury 
(MIRI).
METHODS: We comprehensively investigated the microbial landscape in the oral and 
gut microbiota in DCHD using a discovery cohort (n = 183) and a validation 
chohort (n = 68). Systematically obtained oral (tongue-coating) and fecal 
specimens were subjected to metagenomic sequencing and qPCR analysis, 
respectively, to holistically characterize the microbial consortia. Next, we 
induced diabetic MIRI by administering streptozotocin to C57BL/6 mice and 
subsequently investigated the potential mechanisms of the oral-gut microbiota 
axis through antibiotic pre-treatment followed by gavage with specific bacterial 
strains (Fusobacterium nucleatum or fecal microbiota from DCHD patients) to 
C57BL/6 mice.
RESULTS: Specific microbial signatures such as oral Fusobacterium nucleatum and 
gut Lactobacillus, Eubacterium, and Roseburia faecis, were identified as 
potential microbial biomarkers in DCHD. We further validated that oral 
Fusobacterium nucleatum and gut Lactobacillus are increased in DCHD patients, 
with a positive correlation between the two. Experimental evidence revealed that 
in hyperglycemic mice, augmented Fusobacterium nucleatum levels in the oral 
cavity were accompanied by an imbalance in the oral-gut axis, characterized by 
an increased coexistence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus, along 
with elevated cardiac miRNA-21 and a greater extent of myocardial damage 
indicated by TTC, HE, TUNEL staining, all of which contributed to exacerbated 
MIRI.
CONCLUSION: Our findings not only uncover dysregulation of the oral-gut 
microbiota axis in diabetes patients but also highlight the pivotal intermediary 
role of the increased abundance of oral F. nucleatum and gut Lactobacillus in 
exacerbating MIRI. Targeting the oral-gut microbiota axis emerges as a potent 
strategy for preventing and treating DCHD. Oral-gut microbial transmission 
constitutes an intermediate mechanism by which diabetes influences myocardial 
injury, offering new insights into preventing acute events in diabetic patients 
with coronary heart disease.

The intestinal immune system is highly adapted to maintaining tolerance to the 
commensal microbiota and self-antigens while defending against invading 
pathogens1,2. Recognizing how the diverse network of local cells establish 
homeostasis and maintains it in the complex immune environment of the gut is 
critical to understanding how tolerance can be re-established following 
dysfunction, such as in inflammatory disorders. Although cell and molecular 
interactions that control T regulatory (Treg) cell development and function have 
been identified3,4, less is known about the cellular neighbourhoods and spatial 
compartmentalization that shapes microorganism-reactive Treg cell function. Here 
we used in vivo live imaging, photo-activation-guided single-cell RNA 
sequencing5-7 and spatial transcriptomics to follow the natural history of T 
cells that are reactive towards Helicobacter hepaticus through space and time in 
the settings of tolerance and inflammation. Although antigen stimulation can 
occur anywhere in the tissue, the lamina propria-but not embedded lymphoid 
aggregates-is the key microniche that supports effector Treg (eTreg) cell 
function. eTreg cells are stable once their niche is established; however, 
unleashing inflammation breaks down compartmentalization, leading to dominance 
of CD103+SIRPα+ dendritic cells in the lamina propria. We identify and validate 
the putative tolerogenic interaction between CD206+ macrophages and eTreg cells 
in the lamina propria and identify receptor-ligand pairs that are likely to 
govern the interaction. Our results reveal a spatial mechanism of tolerance in 
the lamina propria and demonstrate how knowledge of local interactions may 
contribute to the next generation of tolerance-inducing therapies.

Slough is a well-known feature of non-healing wounds. This pilot study aims to 
determine the proteomic and microbiologic components of slough as well as 
interrogate the associations between wound slough components and wound healing. 
Ten subjects with slow-to-heal wounds and visible slough were enrolled. 
Aetiologies included venous stasis ulcers, post-surgical site infections and 
pressure ulcers. Patient co-morbidities and wound healing outcome at 3-months 
post-sample collection was recorded. Debrided slough was analysed 
microscopically, through untargeted proteomics, and high-throughput bacterial 
16S-ribosomal gene sequencing. Microscopic imaging revealed wound slough to be 
amorphous in structure and highly variable. 16S-profiling found slough microbial 
communities to associate with wound aetiology and location on the body. Across 
all subjects, slough largely consisted of proteins involved in skin structure 
and formation, blood-clot formation and immune processes. To predict variables 
associated with wound healing, protein, microbial and clinical datasets were 
integrated into a supervised discriminant analysis. This analysis revealed that 
healing wounds were enriched for proteins involved in skin barrier development 
and negative regulation of immune responses. While wounds that deteriorated over 
time started off with a higher baseline Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Score and 
were enriched for anaerobic bacterial taxa and chronic inflammatory proteins. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate clinical, microbiome, and 
proteomic data to systematically characterise wound slough and integrate it into 
a single assessment to predict wound healing outcome. Collectively, our findings 
underscore how slough components can help identify wounds at risk of continued 
impaired healing and serves as an underutilised biomarker.

Traditionally, the role of gut dysbiosis was thought to be limited to 
pathologies like Clostridioides difficile infection, but studies have shown its 
role in other intestinal and extraintestinal pathologies. Similarly, recent 
studies have surfaced showing the strong potential role of the gut microbiome in 
colorectal cancer, which was traditionally attributed mainly to sporadic or 
germline mutations. Given that it is the third most common cancer and the second 
most common cause of cancer-related mortality, 78 grants totaling more than USD 
28 million have been granted to improve colon cancer management since 2019. 
Concerted efforts by several of these studies have identified specific bacterial 
consortia inducing a proinflammatory environment and promoting genotoxin 
production, causing the induction or progression of colorectal cancer. In 
addition, changes in the gut microbiome have also been shown to alter the 
response to cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy, thus changing cancer 
prognosis. Certain bacteria have been identified as biomarkers to predict the 
efficacy of antineoplastic medications. Given these discoveries, efforts have 
been made to alter the gut microbiome to promote a favorable diversity to 
improve cancer progression and the response to therapy. In this review, we 
expand on the gut microbiome, its association with colorectal cancer, and 
antineoplastic medications. We also discuss the evolving paradigm of fecal 
microbiota transplantation in the context of colorectal cancer management.

In recent years, heightened attention has been devoted to unravelling the 
intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors shaping the gut 
microbiota and its significance for human health. This study delves into 
exploring the plausible connection between Alopecia Areata (AA), an autoimmune 
disease, and the dynamics of the gut microbiome. Examining a cohort of healthy 
adults and individuals with AA, both the gut microbiota composition and volatile 
organic compound (VOC) metabolites from faeces and urine were analysed. While 
overall microbiota composition showed no significant differences, 
intra-individual variability revealed distinctions related to age, gender, and 
pathology status, with AA individuals exhibiting reduced species richness and 
evenness. Differential abundance analysis identified microbial biomarkers for 
AA, notably Firmicutes, Lachnospirales, and Blautia, while Coprococcus stood out 
for healthy individuals. The Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery 
using Latent Components (DIABLO) method further supported these findings 
including metabolite biomarkers, such as esters of branched chain fatty acids 
and branched chain amino acids as predictors for AA, suggesting potential links 
to oxidative stress. Despite certain limitations, the study highlights the 
complexity of the gut microbiome and its metabolites in the context of AA, while 
the biomarkers identified could be useful starting points for upcoming studies.

The progression of cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension 
towards decompensated cirrhosis remains clinically challenging and the evolution 
towards acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), with one or more extrahepatic 
organ failures, is associated with very high mortality. In the last decade, 
significant progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms 
leading to decompensation and ACLF. As portal hypertension advances, bacterial 
translocation across an impaired gut barrier culminates in endotoxaemia, 
systemic inflammation and cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction (CAID). 
Gut-derived systemic inflammation and CAID have become the logical targets for 
innovative therapies that prevent hepatic decompensation episodes and the 
progression to ACLF.Furthermore, classification of disease and biomarker 
discovery to personalise care have advanced in the field. This review discusses 
progress in biomarker discovery and personalisation of treatment in 
decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF.

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but inconsistent responses 
persist. Our study delves into the intriguing phenomenon of enhanced 
immunotherapy sensitivity in older individuals with cancers. Through a 
meta-analysis encompassing 25 small-to-mid-sized trials of immune checkpoint 
blockade (ICB), we demonstrate that older individuals exhibit heightened 
responsiveness to ICB therapy. To understand the underlying mechanism, we 
reanalyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple studies and 
unveil distinct upregulation of exhausted and cytotoxic T cell markers within 
the tumor microenvironment (TME) of older patients. Recognizing the potential 
role of gut microbiota in modulating the efficacy of immunotherapy, we identify 
an aging-enriched enterotype linked to improved immunotherapy outcomes in older 
patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments in mice confirm the 
therapeutic potential of the aging-enriched enterotype, enhancing treatment 
sensitivity and reshaping the TME. Our discoveries confront the prevailing 
paradox and provide encouraging paths for tailoring cancer immunotherapy 
strategies according to an individual's gut microbiome profile.

SCOPE: Palmitoleic acid (POA) is an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid that has 
been suggested to improve metabolic disorders. However, it remains unclear 
whether gut microbiota plays a role in the amelioration of metabolic disorders 
by POA. This study aims to investigate the regulation of POA on metabolism, as 
well as systemic inflammation in HFD-fed mice from the perspective of serum 
metabolome and gut microbiome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six C57BL/6 male mice are randomly assigned to 
either a normal chow diet containing 1.9% w/w lard or an HFD containing 20.68% 
w/w lard or 20.68% w/w sea buckthorn pulp oil for 16 weeks. The study finds that 
POA significantly attenuated hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and 
inflammation in HFD-fed mice. POA supplementation significantly alters the 
composition of serum metabolites, particularly lipid metabolites in the 
glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. POA obviously increases the abundance of 
Bifidobacterium and decreases the abundance of Allobaculum. Importantly, the 
study finds that glycerophosphocholine mediates the effect of Bifidobacterium on 
LDL-C, sphingomyelin mediates the effect of Bifidobacterium on IL-6, and 
maslinic acid mediates the effect of Allobaculum on IL-6.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that exogenous POA can improve metabolic 
disorders and inflammation in HFD-fed mice, potentially by modulating the serum 
metabolome and gut microbiome.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to elucidate the causal association between gut 
microbiota (GM) composition and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through a 
comprehensive two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.
METHOD: T2DM data were sourced from the IEU OpenGWAS Project database, 
complemented by 211 gut microbiota (GM) datasets from the MiBioGen Federation. 
The primary analytical approach employed was inverse variance weighted (IVW), 
supplemented by MR-Egger regression and weighted median (WME) methods to 
investigate their potential interplay. Results were assessed using odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The robustness and reliability of the 
findings were confirmed through leave-one-out analysis, heterogeneity testing, 
and assessment of horizontal pleiotropy. Furthermore, we explored the potential 
mediating role of metabolites in the pathway linking GM to T2DM.
RESULT: A set of 11 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to GM were 
identified as instrumental variables (IVs). The IVW analysis revealed that 
increased abundance of the genus Actinomyces, genus Bilophila, genus 
Lachnoclostridium, genus Ruminococcus gnavus group, and genus Streptococcus 
corresponded to a heightened risk of T2DM. Conversely, higher levels of genus 
Eubacterium oxidoreducens group, genus Oscillospira, genus Ruminococcaceae 
UCG003, genus Ruminococcaceae UCG010, and genus Sellimonas were associated with 
a reduced risk of T2DM. However, following false discovery rate (FDR) 
correction, only the abundance of genus Lachnoclostridium retained a significant 
positive correlation with T2DM risk (OR = 1.22, q value = 0.09), while the other 
ten GM showed suggestive associations with T2DM. Reverse MR analysis did not 
reveal any causal relationship between T2DM and the increased risk associated 
with the identified GM. Additionally, metabolites did not exhibit mediating 
effects in this context.
CONCLUSION: This study effectively pinpointed specific GM associated with T2DM, 
potentially paving the way for novel biomarkers in the prevention and treatment 
of this condition. The findings suggested that probiotics could emerge as a 
promising avenue for managing T2DM in the future. Furthermore, the analysis 
indicated that metabolites do not appear to act as mediators in the pathway from 
GM to T2DM.

Altered gut microbiota and metabolites are important for non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) in children. We aimed to comprehensively examine the 
effects of gut metabolites on NAFLD progression. We performed integrative 
metabolomics (untargeted discovery and targeted validation) analysis of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 
obesity in children. Fecal samples were collected from 75 subjects in the 
discovery cohort (25 NAFL, 25 NASH, and 25 obese control children) and 145 
subjects in an independent validation cohort (53 NAFL, 39 NASH, and 53 obese 
control children). Among 2,491 metabolites, untargeted metabolomics revealed a 
complete NAFLD metabolic map containing 318 increased and 123 decreased 
metabolites. Then, machine learning selected 65 important metabolites that can 
distinguish the severity of the NAFLD. Furthermore, precision-targeted 
metabolomics selected 5 novel gut metabolites from 20 typical metabolites. The 
functionality of candidate metabolites was validated in hepatocyte cell lines. 
In the end, this study annotated two novel elevated pathogenic metabolites 
(dodecanoic acid and creatinine) and a relationship between depleted protective 
gut microbiota (Butyricicoccus and Alistipes), increased inflammation (IL-1β), 
lipid metabolism (TG), and liver function (ALT and AST). This study demonstrates 
the role of novel gut metabolites (dodecanoic acid and creatinine), as the fatty 
acid metabolism regulator contributing to NAFLD development through its 
influence on inflammation and liver function.
IMPORTANCE: Altered gut microbiota and metabolites are a major cause of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children. This study demonstrated a 
complete gut metabolic map of children with NAFLD, containing 318 increased and 
123 decreased metabolites by untargeted metabolomic. Multiple validation 
approaches (machine learning and targeted metabolomic) selected five novel gut 
metabolites for targeted metabolomics, which can distinguish NAFLD status and 
severity. The gut microbiota (Butyricicoccus and Alistipes) and metabolites 
(creatinine and dodecanoic acid) were novel biomarkers associated with impaired 
liver function and inflammation and validated by experiments of hepatocyte cell 
lines. The data provide a better understanding of the importance of gut 
microbiota and metabolite alterations in NAFLD, which implies that the altered 
gut microbiota and metabolites may represent a potential target to prevent NAFLD 
development.

BACKGROUND: Ticks serve as vectors for a diverse array of pathogens, including 
viruses responsible for both human and livestock diseases. Symbiotic bacteria 
hold significant potential for controlling tick-borne disease. However, the 
alteration of tick gut bacterial community in response to pathogen infection has 
not been analyzed for any tick-borne viruses. Here, the impact of severe fever 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection on bacterial diversity in 
the gut of Haemaphysalis longicornis is investigated.
METHODS: Unfed tick females were artificially infected with SFTSV. The gut 
samples were collected and the genomic DNA was extracted. We then investigated 
alterations in gut bacterial composition in response to SFTSV infection through 
16S rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: The study found that a reduction in the number of operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs) in the tick gut following SFTSV infection. However, there were no 
significant changes in alpha diversity indices upon infection. Four genera, 
including Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter, Sphingomonas, and Escherichia, were 
identified as biomarkers for the tick gut without SFTSV infection. Notably, the 
predicted correlation network indicated that the biomarkers Sphingomonas and 
Escherichia exhibited positive correlations within the same subcommunity, which 
was altered upon viral infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that the change in tick gut bacterial 
composition upon SFTSV infection and could facilitate the discovery new target 
for tick-borne viral disease control.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 
(PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) can induce remarkable, yet 
unpredictable, responses across a variety of cancers. Studies suggest that there 
is a relationship between a cancer patient's gut microbiota composition and 
clinical response to ICB; however, defining microbiome-based biomarkers that 
generalize across cohorts has been challenging. This may relate to previous 
efforts quantifying microbiota to species (or higher taxonomic rank) abundances, 
whereas microbial functions are often strain specific. Here, we performed deep 
shotgun metagenomic sequencing of baseline fecal samples from a unique, richly 
annotated phase 2 trial cohort of patients with diverse rare cancers treated 
with combination ICB (n = 106 discovery cohort). We demonstrate that 
strain-resolved microbial abundances improve machine learning predictions of ICB 
response and 12-month progression-free survival relative to models built using 
species-rank quantifications or comprehensive pretreatment clinical factors. 
Through a meta-analysis of gut metagenomes from a further six comparable studies 
(n = 364 validation cohort), we found cross-cancer (and cross-country) validity 
of strain-response signatures, but only when the training and test cohorts used 
concordant ICB regimens (anti-PD-1 monotherapy or combination anti-PD-1 plus 
anti-CTLA-4). This suggests that future development of gut microbiome 
diagnostics or therapeutics should be tailored according to ICB treatment 
regimen rather than according to cancer type.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous factors are known to influence reproductive efficiency in 
ewes, but few studies have investigated the potential role of vaginal microbiota 
in sheep reproductive success. The objective of this study was to thoroughly 
characterize the ewe vaginal microbiota throughout the course of pregnancy.
METHODS: Vaginal samples were collected from 31 pregnant Hampshire and Hampshire 
X Suffolk crossbred ewes on a weekly basis from pre-breeding to pregnancy 
testing and then biweekly until just after lambing. To characterize the vaginal 
microbial communities, DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene Illumina MiSeq 
amplicon sequencing was performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Alpha diversity metrics indicated an increase in species 
richness, evenness, and overall diversity throughout gestation. Distinct shifts 
in the bacterial communities were observed during gestation and were segregated 
into three periods: early gestation, a transitional period and mid/late 
gestation. During early gestation, Actinobacillus, Histophilus, and unclassified 
Leptotrichiaceae were found in greater relative abundance. During the 
transitional period, a population shift occurred characterized by increasing 
relative abundance of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. During mid/late 
gestation, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma had the greatest 
relative abundance. These shifts in the microbial population throughout the 
ewe's gestation are likely related to hormonal changes triggered by the growing 
conceptus, specifically increasing blood concentration of progesterone. The 
transitional period shift in vaginal microbial communities potentially aligns 
with the placental take-over of progesterone production from the corpus luteum 
at approximately day 50 after conception (gestational week 7). Understanding the 
observed variability of the vaginal microbiota throughout pregnancy will allow 
for future comparison of ewes that did not become pregnant or had abnormal 
pregnancies, which could lead to the discovery of potential bacterial biomarkers 
for pregnancy outcome; this understanding could also lead to development of 
probiotics to improve sheep reproductive success.

Early-life human gut microbiome is a pivotal driver of gut homeostasis and 
infant health. However, the viral component (known as "virome") remains mostly 
unexplored. Here, we establish the Early-Life Gut Virome (ELGV), a catalog of 
160,478 non-redundant DNA and RNA viral sequences from 8130 gut virus-like 
particles (VLPs) enriched or bulk metagenomes in the first three years of life. 
By clustering, 82,141 viral species are identified, 68.3% of which are absent in 
existing databases built mainly from adults, and 64 and 8 viral species based on 
VLPs-enriched and bulk metagenomes, respectively, exhibit potentials as 
biomarkers to distinguish infants from adults. With the largest longitudinal 
population of infants profiled by either VLPs-enriched or bulk metagenomic 
sequencing, we track the inherent instability and temporal development of the 
early-life human gut virome, and identify differential viruses associated with 
multiple clinical factors. The mother-infant shared virome and interactions 
between gut virome and bacteriome early in life are further expanded. Together, 
the ELGV catalog provides the most comprehensive and complete metagenomic 
blueprint of the early-life human gut virome, facilitating the discovery of 
pediatric disease-virome associations in future.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves systemic changes in peripheral blood 
and gut microbiota, but the current understanding is incomplete. Herein, we 
conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an 
observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n 
= 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in 
MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut 
microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in 
the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and 
downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics 
revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased 
sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in 
arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic 
pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes 
showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory 
immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease 
severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two 
immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we 
established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC. These 
findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MDD pathogenesis and 
provide valuable resources for the discovery of biomarkers.

The gut microbiota composition can affect the tumor microenvironment and its 
interaction with the immune system, thereby having implications for treatment 
predictions. This article reviews the studies available to better understand how 
the gut microbiome helps the immune system fight cancer. To describe this fact, 
different mechanisms and approaches utilizing probiotics to improve advancements 
in cancer treatment will be discussed. Moreover, not only calorie intake but 
also the variety and quality of diet can influence cancer patients' 
immunotherapy treatment because dietary patterns can impair immunological 
activities either by stimulating or suppressing innate and adaptive immunity. 
Therefore, it is interesting and critical to understand gut microbiome 
composition as a biomarker to predict cancer immunotherapy outcomes and 
responses. Here, more emphasis will be given to the recent development in 
immunotherapies utilizing microbiota to improve cancer therapies, which is 
beneficial for cancer patients.

Gut microbes is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
However, it is still unclear which gut microbiota are the key factors affecting 
T1D and their influence on the development and progression of the disease. To 
fill these knowledge gaps, we constructed a model to find biomarker from gut 
microbiota in patients with T1D. We first identified microbial markers using 
Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and random forest (RF) methods. 
Furthermore, by constructing co-occurrence networks for gut microbes in T1D, we 
aimed to reveal all gut microbial interactions as well as major beneficial and 
pathogenic bacteria in healthy populations and type 1 diabetic patients. 
Finally, PICRUST2 was used to predict Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) functional pathways and KO gene levels of microbial markers to 
investigate the biological role. Our study revealed that 21 identified microbial 
genera are important biomarker for T1D. Their AUC values are 0.962 and 0.745 on 
discovery set and validation set. Functional analysis showed that 10 microbial 
genera were significantly positively associated with D-arginine and D-ornithine 
metabolism, spliceosome in transcription, steroid hormone biosynthesis and 
glycosaminoglycan degradation. These genera were significantly negatively 
correlated with steroid biosynthesis, cyanoamino acid metabolism and drug 
metabolism. The other 11 genera displayed an inverse correlation. In summary, 
our research identified a comprehensive set of T1D gut biomarkers with universal 
applicability and have revealed the biological consequences of alterations in 
gut microbiota and their interplay. These findings offer significant prospects 
for individualized management and treatment of T1D.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
has attracted more attention recently, whereas profiles of subgingival 
microbiomes and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) metabolic signatures in AD 
patients have rarely been characterized; thus, little evidence exists to support 
the oral-brain axis hypothesis. Therefore, our study aimed to characterize both 
the microbial community of subgingival plaque and the metabolomic profiles of 
GCF in patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) for the 
first time.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Clinical examinations were performed 
on all participants. The microbial community of subgingival plaque and the 
metabolomic profiles of GCF were characterized using the 16S ribosomal RNA 
(rRNA) gene high-throughput sequencing and liquid chromatography linked to 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with AD, 32 patients with aMCI, and 32 cognitively 
normal people were enrolled. The severity of periodontitis was significantly 
increased in AD patients compared with aMCI patients and cognitively normal 
people. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that the relative abundances 
of 16 species in subgingival plaque were significantly correlated with cognitive 
function, and LC-MS/MS analysis identified a total of 165 differentially 
abundant metabolites in GCF. Moreover, multiomics Data Integration Analysis for 
Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO) analysis revealed that 19 
differentially abundant metabolites were significantly correlated with 
Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Leptotrichia buccalis, 
Pseudoleptotrichia goodfellowii, and Actinomyces massiliensis, in which 
galactinol, sn-glycerol 3-phosphoethanolamine, D-mannitol, 1 
h-indole-1-pentanoic acid, 3-(1-naphthalenylcarbonyl)- and L-iditol yielded 
satisfactory accuracy for the predictive diagnosis of AD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first combined subgingival microbiome and GCF 
metabolome study in patients with AD and aMCI, which revealed that periodontal 
microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders may be involved in the etiology and 
progression of AD, and the differential abundance of the microbiota and 
metabolites may be useful as potential markers for AD in the future.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths, and GC 
treatments represent a large area of research. Although initially regarded as a 
sterile organ and unsuitable for microbial communities, the discovery of 
Helicobacter pylori made us realize that some microbes can colonize the stomach. 
In recent years, growing interest in gastric bacteria has expanded to the gut 
microbiota and, more recently, to the oral microbiota. Indeed, the 
oral-gastric-gut microbiota axis may play a crucial role in maintaining 
homeostasis, while changes in microbiota composition in GC patients can 
influence clinical outcomes. On the one hand, the microbiota and its metabolites 
may significantly influence the progression of GC, while anti-GC treatments such 
as gastrectomy and chemotherapy may significantly impact the oral-gastric-gut 
microbiota axis of GC patients. In this context, the role of nutritional 
therapies, including diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, in treating GC should not 
be underestimated. Wit this review, we aim to highlight the main role of the 
gastric, oral, and gut microbiota in GC onset and progression, representing 
potential future biomarkers for early GC detection and a target for efficient 
nutritional therapies during the course of GC.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent developments in high-throughput proteomic 
technologies enable the discovery of novel biomarkers of coronary 
atherosclerosis. The aims of this study were to test if plasma protein subsets 
could detect coronary artery calcifications (CAC) in asymptomatic individuals 
and if they add predictive value beyond traditional risk factors.
METHODS: Using proximity extension assays, 1,342 plasma proteins were measured 
in 1,827 individuals from the Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Microbiota (IGTM) 
study and 883 individuals from the Swedish Cardiopulmonary BioImage Study 
(SCAPIS) aged 50-64 years without history of ischaemic heart disease and with 
CAC assessed by computed tomography. After data-driven feature selection, 
extreme gradient boosting machine learning models were trained on the IGTM 
cohort to predict the presence of CAC using combinations of proteins and 
traditional risk factors. The trained models were validated in SCAPIS.
RESULTS: The best plasma protein subset (44 proteins) predicted CAC with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.691 in the validation cohort. However, this was not 
better than prediction by traditional risk factors alone (AUC = 0.710, P = .17). 
Adding proteins to traditional risk factors did not improve the predictions (AUC 
= 0.705, P = .6). Most of these 44 proteins were highly correlated with 
traditional risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: A plasma protein subset that could predict the presence of 
subclinical CAC was identified but it did not outperform nor improve a model 
based on traditional risk factors. Thus, support for this targeted proteomics 
platform to predict subclinical CAC beyond traditional risk factors was not 
found.

Microbial metabolites have been indicated to communicate with the host's 
endocrine system, regulating hormone production, immune-endocrine 
communications, and interactions along the gut-brain axis, eventually affecting 
the occurrence of endocrine cancer. Furthermore, microbiota metabolites such as 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been found to affect the tumor 
microenvironment and boost immunity against tumors. SCFAs, including butyrate 
and acetate, have been demonstrated to exert anti-proliferative and 
anti-protective activity on pancreatic cancer cells. The employing of microbial 
metabolic products in conjunction with radiation and chemotherapy has shown 
promising outcomes in terms of reducing treatment side effects and boosting 
effectiveness. Certain metabolites, such as valerate and butyrate, have been 
made known to improve the efficiency of CAR T-cell treatment, whilst others, 
such as indole-derived tryptophan metabolites, have been shown to inhibit tumor 
immunity. This review explores the intricate interplay between microbial 
metabolites and endocrine tumorigenesis, spanning mechanistic insights to the 
discovery of potential therapeutic biomarkers.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) commonly arises in individuals with premalignant colon 
lesions known as polyps, with both conditions being influenced by gut 
microbiota. Host-related factors and inherent characteristics of polyps and 
tumors may contribute to microbiome variability, potentially acting as 
confounding factors in the discovery of taxonomic biomarkers for both 
conditions. In this study we employed shotgun metagenomics to analyze the 
taxonomic diversity of bacteria present in fecal samples of 90 clinical subjects 
(comprising 30 CRC patients, 30 with polyps and 30 controls). Our findings 
revealed a decrease in taxonomic richness among individuals with polyps and CRC, 
with significant dissimilarities observed among the study groups. We identified 
significant alterations in the abundance of specific taxa associated with polyps 
(Streptococcaceae, Lachnoclostridium, and Ralstonia) and CRC (Lactobacillales, 
Clostridiaceae, Desulfovibrio, SFB, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium). 
Clostridiaceae exhibited significantly lower abundance in the early stages of 
CRC. Additionally, our study revealed a positive co-occurrence among 
underrepresented genera in CRC, while demonstrating a negative co-occurrence 
between Faecalibacterium and Desulfovibrio, suggesting potential antagonistic 
relationships. Moreover, we observed variations in taxonomic richness and/or 
abundance within the polyp and CRC bacteriome linked to polyp size, tumor stage, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes with metformin use, sex, age, and family history of CRC. 
These findings provide potential new biomarkers to enhance early CRC diagnosis 
while also demonstrating how intrinsic host factors contribute to establishing a 
heterogeneous microbiome in patients with CRC and polyps.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cognitive 
impairment has become a common clinical phenomenon. However, there is currently 
limited research on the etiology of this disease cluster, discovery of 
biomarkers, and identification of precise intervention targets.
METHODS: We explored the causal connections between gut microbiota, blood 
metabolites, and the disease cluster of CAD combined with cognitive impairment 
through two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR). Additionally, we determine 
the gut microbiota and blood metabolites with the strongest causal associations 
using Bayesian model averaging multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR-BMA) 
analysis. Furthermore, we will investigate the mediating role of blood 
metabolites through a two-step Mendelian randomization design.
RESULTS: We identified gut microbiota that had significant causal associations 
with cognitive impairment. Additionally, we also discovered blood metabolites 
that exhibited significant causal associations with both CAD and cognitive 
impairment. According to the MR-BMA results, the free cholesterol to total 
lipids ratio in large very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was identified as the 
key blood metabolite significantly associated with CAD. Similarly, the 
cholesteryl esters to total lipids ratio in small VLDL emerged as the primary 
blood metabolite with a significant causal association with dementia with lewy 
bodies (DLB). For the two-step Mendelian randomization analysis, we identified 
blood metabolites that could potentially mediate the association between genus 
Butyricicoccus and CAD in the potential causal links.
CONCLUSION: Our study utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify the gut 
microbiota features and blood metabolites characteristics associated with the 
disease cluster of CAD combined with cognitive impairment. These findings will 
provide a meaningful reference for the identification of biomarkers for the 
disease cluster of CAD combined with cognitive impairment as well as the 
discovery of targets for intervention to address the problems in the clinic.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common clinical manifestation of a 
perturbed vaginal ecology associated with adverse sexual and reproductive health 
outcomes if left untreated. The existing diagnostic modalities are either 
cumbersome or require skilled expertise, warranting alternate tests. Application 
of machine-learning tools to heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-omics 
datasets finds promising potential in data integration and may aid biomarker 
discovery.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of the microbiome 
and metabolome-derived biomarkers in BV diagnosis. Interpretable 
machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate the utility of an 
integrated-omics-derived classification model.
METHODS: Vaginal samples obtained from reproductive-age group women with 
(n = 40) and without BV (n = 40) were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing 
and LC-MS-based metabolomics. The vaginal microbiome and metabolome were 
characterized, and machine-learning analysis was performed to build a 
classification model using biomarkers with the highest diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: Microbiome-based diagnostic model exhibited a ROC-AUC (10-fold CV) of 
0.84 ± 0.21 and accuracy of 0.79 ± 0.18, and important features were Aerococcus 
spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Sneathia spp., Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., 
Gardnerella spp. and Fannyhessea vaginae. The metabolome-derived model displayed 
superior performance with a ROC-AUC of 0.97 ± 0.07 and an accuracy of 
0.92 ± 0.08. Beta-leucine, methylimidazole acetaldehyde, dimethylethanolamine, 
L-arginine and beta cortol were among key predictive metabolites for BV. A 
predictive model combining both microbial and metabolite features exhibited a 
high ROC-AUC of 0.97 ± 0.07 and accuracy of 0.94 ± 0.08 with diagnostic 
performance only slightly superior to the metabolite-based model.
CONCLUSION: Application of machine-learning tools to multi-omics datasets aid 
biomarker discovery with high predictive performance. Metabolome-derived 
classification models were observed to have superior diagnostic performance in 
predicting BV than microbiome-based biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Recently, intestinal bacteria have attracted attention as factors 
affecting the prognosis of patients with cancer. However, the intestinal 
microbiome is composed of several hundred types of bacteria, necessitating the 
development of an analytical method that can allow the use of this information 
as a highly accurate biomarker. In this study, we investigated whether the 
preoperative intestinal bacterial profile in patients with esophageal cancer who 
underwent surgery after preoperative chemotherapy could be used as a biomarker 
of postoperative recurrence of esophageal cancer.
METHODS: We determined the gut microbiome of the patients using 16S rRNA 
metagenome sequencing, followed by statistical analysis. Simultaneously, we 
performed a machine learning analysis using a random forest model with 
hyperparameter tuning and compared the data obtained.
RESULTS: Statistical and machine learning analyses revealed two common bacterial 
genera, Butyricimonas and Actinomyces, which were abundant in cases with 
recurrent esophageal cancer. Butyricimonas primarily produces butyrate, whereas 
Actinomyces are oral bacteria whose function in the gut is unknown.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Butyricimonas spp. may be a biomarker of 
postoperative recurrence of esophageal cancer. Although the extent of the 
involvement of these bacteria in immune regulation remains unknown, future 
research should investigate their presence in other pathological conditions. 
Such research could potentially lead to a better understanding of the 
immunological impact of these bacteria on patients with cancer and their 
application as biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, human microbiome studies have received increasing 
attention as this field is considered a potential source for clinical 
applications. With the advancements in omics technologies and AI, research 
focused on the discovery for potential biomarkers in the human microbiome using 
machine learning tools has produced positive outcomes. Despite the promising 
results, several issues can still be found in these studies such as datasets 
with small number of samples, inconsistent results, lack of uniform processing 
and methodologies, and other additional factors lead to lack of reproducibility 
in biomedical research. In this work, we propose a methodology that combines the 
DADA2 pipeline for 16s rRNA sequences processing and the Recursive Ensemble 
Feature Selection (REFS) in multiple datasets to increase reproducibility and 
obtain robust and reliable results in biomedical research.
RESULTS: Three experiments were performed analyzing microbiome data from 
patients/cases in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Autism Spectrum Disorder 
(ASD), and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). In each experiment, we found a biomarker 
signature in one dataset and applied to 2 other as further validation. The 
effectiveness of the proposed methodology was compared with other feature 
selection methods such as K-Best with F-score and random selection as a base 
line. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was employed as a measure of diagnostic 
accuracy and used as a metric for comparing the results of the proposed 
methodology with other feature selection methods. Additionally, we use the 
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as a metric to evaluate the performance 
of the methodology as well as for comparison with other feature selection 
methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a methodology for reproducible biomarker discovery for 
16s rRNA microbiome sequence analysis, addressing the issues related with data 
dimensionality, inconsistent results and validation across independent datasets. 
The findings from the three experiments, across 9 different datasets, show that 
the proposed methodology achieved higher accuracy compared to other feature 
selection methods. This methodology is a first approach to increase 
reproducibility, to provide robust and reliable results.

Mounting evidence underscores the intricate interplay between the immune system 
and skeletal muscles in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), as well as during 
regular muscle regeneration. While immune cell infiltration into skeletal 
muscles stands out as a prominent feature in the disease pathophysiology, a 
myriad of secondary defects involving metabolic and inflammatory pathways 
persist, with the key players yet to be fully elucidated. Steroids, currently 
the sole effective therapy for delaying onset and symptom control, come with 
adverse side effects, limiting their widespread use. Preliminary evidence 
spotlighting the distinctive features of T cell profiling in DMD prompts the 
immuno-characterization of circulating cells. A molecular analysis of their 
transcriptome and secretome holds the promise of identifying a subpopulation of 
cells suitable as disease biomarkers. Furthermore, it provides a gateway to 
unraveling new pathological pathways and pinpointing potential therapeutic 
targets. Simultaneously, the last decade has witnessed the emergence of novel 
approaches. The development and equilibrium of both innate and adaptive immune 
systems are intricately linked to the gut microbiota. Modulating 
microbiota-derived metabolites could potentially exacerbate muscle damage 
through immune system activation. Concurrently, genome sequencing has conferred 
clinical utility for rare disease diagnosis since innovative methodologies have 
been deployed to interpret the functional consequences of genomic variations. 
Despite numerous genes falling short as clinical targets for MD, the exploration 
of Tdark genes holds promise for unearthing novel and uncharted therapeutic 
insights. In the quest to expedite the translation of fundamental knowledge into 
clinical applications, the identification of novel biomarkers and disease 
targets is paramount. This initiative not only advances our understanding but 
also paves the way for the design of innovative therapeutic strategies, 
contributing to enhanced care for individuals grappling with these 
incapacitating diseases.

BACKGROUND: IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (IgE-CMA) is one of the first 
allergies to arise in early childhood and may result from exposure to various 
milk allergens, of which β-lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein are the most 
important. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind IgE-CMA is imperative 
for the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of innovative treatment and 
prevention strategies.
METHODS: We report a longitudinal in vivo murine model, in which two mice 
strains (BALB/c and C57Bl/6) were sensitized to BLG using either cholera toxin 
or an oil emulsion (n = 6 per group). After sensitization, mice were challenged 
orally, their clinical signs monitored, antibody (IgE and IgG1) and cytokine 
levels (IL-4 and IFN-γ) measured, and fecal samples subjected to metabolomics. 
The results of the murine models were further extrapolated to fecal 
microbiome-metabolome data from our population of IgE-CMA (n = 22) and healthy 
(n = 23) children (Trial: NCT04249973), on which polar metabolomics, lipidomics 
and 16S rRNA metasequencing were performed. In vitro gastrointestinal digestions 
and multi-omics corroborated the microbial origin of proposed metabolic changes.
RESULTS: During mice sensitization, we observed multiple microbially derived 
metabolic alterations, most importantly bile acid, energy and tryptophan 
metabolites, that preceded allergic inflammation. We confirmed microbial 
dysbiosis, and its associated effect on metabolic alterations in our patient 
cohort, through in vitro digestions and multi-omics, which was accompanied by 
metabolic signatures of low-grade inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that gut dysbiosis precedes allergic 
inflammation and nurtures a chronic low-grade inflammation in children on 
elimination diets, opening important new opportunities for future prevention and 
treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial 
neurodevelopmental disorder. Major interplays between the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract and the central nervous system (CNS) seem to be driven by gut microbiota 
(GM). Herein, we provide a GM functional characterization, based on GM 
metabolomics, mapping of bacterial biochemical pathways, and anamnestic, 
clinical, and nutritional patient metadata.
METHODS: Fecal samples collected from children with ASD and neurotypical 
children were analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry coupled with 
solid phase microextraction (GC-MS/SPME) to determine volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) associated with the metataxonomic approach by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses assessed differential VOC 
profiles and relationships with ASD anamnestic and clinical features for 
biomarker discovery. Multiple web-based and machine learning (ML) models 
identified metabolic predictors of disease and network analyses correlated GM 
ecological and metabolic patterns.
RESULTS: The GM core volatilome for all ASD patients was characterized by a high 
concentration of 1-pentanol, 1-butanol, phenyl ethyl alcohol; 
benzeneacetaldehyde, octadecanal, tetradecanal; methyl isobutyl ketone, 
2-hexanone, acetone; acetic, propanoic, 3-methyl-butanoic and 2-methyl-propanoic 
acids; indole and skatole; and o-cymene. Patients were stratified based on age, 
GI symptoms, and ASD severity symptoms. Disease risk prediction allowed us to 
associate butanoic acid with subjects older than 5 years, indole with the 
absence of GI symptoms and low disease severity, propanoic acid with the ASD 
risk group, and p-cymene with ASD symptoms, all based on the predictive CBCL-EXT 
scale. The HistGradientBoostingClassifier model classified ASD patients vs. 
CTRLs by an accuracy of 89%, based on methyl isobutyl ketone, 
benzeneacetaldehyde, phenyl ethyl alcohol, ethanol, butanoic acid, octadecane, 
acetic acid, skatole, and tetradecanal features. LogisticRegression models 
corroborated methyl isobutyl ketone, benzeneacetaldehyde, phenyl ethyl alcohol, 
skatole, and acetic acid as ASD predictors.
CONCLUSION: Our results will aid the development of advanced clinical decision 
support systems (CDSSs), assisted by ML models, for advanced ASD-personalized 
medicine, based on omics data integrated into electronic health/medical records. 
Furthermore, new ASD screening strategies based on GM-related predictors could 
be used to improve ASD risk assessment by uncovering novel ASD onset and risk 
predictors.

PURPOSE: Lower back pain (LBP), mainly caused by intervertebral disk (IVD) 
degeneration (IDD), is widely prevalent worldwide and is a serious socioeconomic 
burden. Numerous factors may trigger this degenerative process, and microbial 
dysbiosis has recently been implicated as one of the likely causes. However, the 
exact relationship between IDD and the microbiome remains obscure. In this 
study, we investigated the gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolic 
phenotype and discussed the possible influences of microbiome dysbiosis on IDD.
METHODS: Fecal DNA was extracted from 16 fecal samples (eight rabbit models with 
IDD and eight sex- and age-matched healthy controls) and analyzed by 
high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing. The fecal samples were also analyzed by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Multivariate 
analyses were conducted for the relationship between the omics data and IDD, 
linear discriminant analysis effect size was employed for biomarker discovery. 
Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used 
to annotate the differential metabolites. The potential correlation between 
differential gut microbiota and metabolites was then assessed.
RESULTS: The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the β-diversity of the gut 
microbiota was significantly different between the IDD and control groups, with 
distinct abundance levels of dominant genera. Moreover, 59 metabolites were 
significantly upregulated and 91 were downregulated in IDD rabbits versus the 
controls. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the top pathways remarkably 
impacted by IDD were tyrosine metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar 
metabolism, benzoate degradation, ABC transporters, ascorbate and aldarate 
metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and pyrimidine metabolism. The 
correlation analysis revealed that DL-tyrosine and N-acetylmuramic acid were 
associated with multiple differential bacterial genera, including Helicobacter 
and Vibrio, which may play important roles in the process of IVD degeneration.
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that IDD altered gut microbiota and fecal 
metabolites in a rabbit model. The correlation analysis of microbiota and 
metabolome provides a deeper understanding of IDD and its possible 
etiopathogenesis. These results also provide a direction and theoretical basis 
for the clinical application of fecal transplantation, probiotics, and other 
methods to regulate gut microbiota in the treatment of LBP caused by IDD.
