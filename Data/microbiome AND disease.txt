The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in influencing various physiological 
processes and maintaining overall well-being, including the gastric system. 
Current diagnostic tests for gastric diseases often involve invasive procedures, 
sampling limitations, and medication effects, leading to potential diagnostic 
errors and discomfort to patients. Considering the connection between oral and 
gastric microbiomes, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the diagnostic 
potential of the oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing upper digestive 
endoscopy. Oral samples from 266 participants across two Brazilian sites 
(Belterra and Sao Paulo) were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis 
to identify microbiome composition across endoscopy outcome groups, exploring 
alpha and beta-diversity, richness, and differential abundance and prevalence. 
Prevotella, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Streptococcus were the 
most abundant genera observed. No significant associations were found between 
alpha diversity profiles and endoscopy outcomes; beta diversity analyses 
similarly showed no correlations. Overall, the study did not establish the oral 
microbiome as a reliable marker for gastric health, underscoring the necessity 
for broader studies in the development of non-invasive diagnostic tests.

BACKGROUND: Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pan-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 
inhibitor, ameliorates multiple pathological conditions and tissue injury and 
shows strong potential for clinical applications. Here, we investigated the 
preventive effects of DCA in a murine model of alcohol-associated liver disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the acute-on-chronic model of 
alcohol-associated liver disease and treated with DCA. Livers were assessed in 
liver histology, biochemistry, and gene expression. Mass spectrometry was used 
to compare protein expression and metabolite levels.
RESULTS: DCA inhibited hepatic expression of inflammatory genes but did not 
prevent steatosis and hepatocellular injury in ethanol-fed mice. Consistently, 
DCA repressed the expression of mRNAs for inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated 
murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human monocytic THP-1 cells and 
inhibited both gene expression and protein release of interleukin-1 beta. DCA 
prevented hepatic accumulation of isovaleric acid in ethanol-fed mice, a 
short-chain fatty acid primarily produced by gut microbiota. In vitro, 
isovaleric acid potentiated LPS's effects, while DCA prevented this 
proinflammatory action. Ethanol feeding increased the expression of proteins 
involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including branched-chain amino acid 
(BCAA) degradation. In ethanol-fed mice, hepatic Fischer's ratio (the molar 
ratio of BCAAs to aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr) and BTR (the molar ratio of 
BCAAs to Tyr) showed a decrease compared to pair-fed mice; however, this 
decrease was not observed in DCA-treated ethanol-fed mice. DCA blunted the 
ethanol-induced increase of BCKDHA, the rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism, 
and cytochrome P450 2E1.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol-induced hepatic inflammatory responses and metabolic 
disturbances were prevented by DCA in mice, indicating the potential to develop 
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors as an effective therapy to treat 
alcohol-associated liver disease.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a heterogenous group of diseases with an yet unknown 
exact pathogenesis. An interplay between genetic predispositionw (mainly 
HLA-B*27 positivity), a barrier leakage (of skin and gut) and environmental 
influences, such as the contact to certain microbiota are suspected to lead to 
an activation of the immune system and through this to the development and 
maintenance of the disease.

Publisher: Die Spondyloarthritiden (SpA) umfassen eine heterogene Gruppe von 
Erkrankungen, deren genaue Pathogenese nicht bekannt ist. Es wird vermutet, dass 
ein Zusammenspiel zwischen genetischer Prädisposition (v. a. HLA-B*27 
Positivität), einer Barrierestörung (u. a. von Haut und Darm) und 
Umwelteinflüsse wie der Kontakt zu bestimmten Mikrobiota über eine Aktivierung 
des Immunsystems zur Entstehung und Unterhaltung der Erkrankung führen könnte.

Because large brains are energetically expensive, they are associated with 
metabolic traits that facilitate energy availability across vertebrates. 
However, the biological underpinnings driving these traits are not known. Given 
its role in regulating host metabolism in disease studies, we hypothesized that 
the gut microbiome contributes to variation in normal cross-vertebrate species 
differences in metabolism, including those associated with the brain's energetic 
requirements. By inoculating germ-free mice with the gut microbiota (GM) of 
three primate species - two with relatively larger brains and one with a smaller 
brain - we demonstrated that the GM of larger-brained primates shifts host 
metabolism towards energy use and production, while that of smaller-brained 
primates stimulates energy storage in adipose tissues. Our findings establish a 
causal role of the GM in normal cross-host species differences in metabolism 
associated with relative brain size and suggest that the GM may have been an 
important facilitator of metabolic changes during human evolution that supported 
encephalization.

Throughout gestation, the female body undergoes a series of transformations, 
including profound alterations in intestinal microbial communities. Changes 
gradually increase toward the end of pregnancy and comprise reduced α-diversity 
of microbial communities and an increased propensity for energy harvest. Despite 
the importance of the intestinal microbiota for the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory bowel diseases, very little is known about the relationship between 
these microbiota shifts and pregnancy-associated complications of the disease. 
Here, we explored the longitudinal dynamics of gut microbiota composition and 
functional potential during pregnancy and after lactation in Atg16l1∆IEC mice 
carrying an intestinal epithelial deletion of the Crohn's disease risk gene 
Atg16l1. Using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we 
demonstrated divergent temporal shifts in microbial composition between Atg16l1 
wildtype and Atg16l1∆IEC pregnant mice in trimester 3, which was validated in an 
independent experiment. Observed differences included microbial genera 
implicated in IBD such as Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and 
Turicibacter. Changes partially recovered after lactation. Additionally, 
metagenomic and metabolomic analyses suggest an increased capacity for chitin 
degradation, resulting in higher levels of free N-acetyl-glucosamine products in 
feces, alongside reduced glucose and myo-inositol levels in serum around the 
time of delivery. On the host side, we found that the immunological response of 
Atg16l1∆IEC mice is characterized by higher colonic mRNA levels of TNFα and 
CXCL1 in trimester 3 and a lower weight of offspring at birth. Understanding 
pregnancy-dependent microbiome changes in the context of IBD may constitute the 
first step in the identification of fecal microbial biomarkers and 
microbiota-directed therapies that could help improve precision care for 
managing pregnancies in IBD patients.

BACKGROUND: Asthma, a prevalent chronic inflammatory respiratory disease among 
children, was the focus of this study. Serum metabolism profiles were examined 
in patients diagnosed with both asthma and bronchiolitis by using ultra-high 
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
METHODS: In this study, the serum samples from three distinct groups-comprising 
patients diagnosed with asthma, bronchiolitis, and a healthy control 
group-underwent comprehensive non-targeted metabolomics analysis and targeted 
eicosanoid profiling.
RESULTS: Through both univariate and multivariate analyses, significant 
associations were observed between the pathophysiology of both asthma and 
bronchiolitis and aberrations in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
amino acids, purines, and pathways involving cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, 
indicative of inflammatory processes and immune responses. Furthermore, 
metabolic changes in phosphatidylethanolamine, saturated and monounsaturated 
fatty acids, and bile acids were observed in the asthma group. Bronchiolitis was 
distinguished by disruptions in acyl carnitine and phosphatidylcholine 
metabolism.
CONCLUSION: This study offers a new perspective on understanding the interplay 
of pathogenic mechanisms underlying both asthma and bronchiolitis. Its findings 
are significant for enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored 
to asthma stemming from bronchiolitis.

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are very common and presently implicated in 
9 out of 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Despite this fact, our 
mechanistic understanding of how ACEs impact health is limited. Moreover, 
interventions for reducing stress presently use a one-size-fits-all approach 
that involves no treatment tailoring or precision. To address these issues, we 
developed a combined cross-sectional study and randomized controlled trial, 
called the California Stress, Trauma, and Resilience Study (CalSTARS), to (a) 
characterize how ACEs influence multisystem biological functioning in adults 
with all levels of ACE burden and current perceived stress, using multiomics and 
other complementary approaches, and (b) test the efficacy of our new California 
Precision Intervention for Stress and Resilience (PRECISE) in adults with 
elevated perceived stress levels who have experienced the full range of ACEs. 
The primary trial outcome is perceived stress, and the secondary outcomes span a 
variety of psychological, emotional, biological, and behavioral variables, as 
assessed using self-report measures, wearable technologies, and extensive 
biospecimens (i.e. DNA, saliva, blood, urine, & stool) that will be subjected to 
genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, immunomic, and 
metagenomic/microbiome analysis. In this protocol paper, we describe the 
scientific gaps motivating this study as well as the sample, study design, 
procedures, measures, and planned analyses. Ultimately, our goal is to leverage 
the power of cutting-edge tools from psychology, multiomics, precision medicine, 
and translational bioinformatics to identify social, molecular, and 
immunological processes that can be targeted to reduce stress-related disease 
risk and enhance biopsychosocial resilience in individuals and communities 
worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest a potential link between intestinal flora and 
acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the causal relationships between specific 
intestinal flora and AP, and the possible mediating role of immune cell traits, 
remain unclear.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 5,959 participants was 
conducted to identify genetic instrumental variables associated with 473 
intestinal flora taxa. Summary statistics for AP were obtained from the UK 
Biobank. Immune cell traits were also identified using large-scale GWAS summary 
data. We employed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach to investigate the causal relationships between intestinal flora, 
immune cell traits, and AP, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary 
statistical method. Sensitivity analyses, including the MR-Egger intercept test, 
Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO test, and leave-one-out test, were conducted to 
assess the robustness of our findings. Additionally, we explored whether immune 
cell traits mediate the pathway from intestinal flora to AP.
RESULTS: 11 positive and 11 negative causal relationships were identified 
between genetic susceptibility in intestinal flora and AP. Furthermore, 19 
positive and 9 negative causal relationships were observed between immune cell 
traits and AP. Notably, CD38 mediated the causal relationship between Bacillus C 
and AP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to uncover novel causal relationships 
between various intestinal flora and acute pancreatitis, emphasizing the 
mediating role of immune cell traits in the pathway from intestinal flora to AP. 
It also provides new evidence supporting the conditional pathogenicity of the 
Bacillus genus.

The brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) system plays an influential role on mental 
health. We characterized BGM patterns related to resilience using fecal samples 
and multimodal MRI. Data integration analysis using latent components showed the 
high resilience phenotype was associated with lower depression and anxiety 
symptoms, higher frequency of bacterial transcriptomes (related to environmental 
adaptation, genetic propagation, energy metabolism, anti-inflammation), 
increased metabolites (N-acetylglutamate; dimethylglycine), and cortical 
signatures (increased resting state functional connectivity between reward 
circuits and sensorimotor networks; decreased grey matter volume and white 
matter tracts within the emotion regulation network). Our findings support a 
multi-omic signature involving the BGM system suggesting that resilience impacts 
psychological symptoms, emotion regulation and cognitive function as reflected 
by unique neural correlates and microbiome function supporting eubiosis and gut 
barrier integrity. Bacterial transcriptomes provided the highest classification 
accuracy suggesting that the microbiome is critical in shaping resilience and 
highlights that microbiome modifications can optimize mental health.

Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is not well understood 
in relation to the microbiome. Our objective was to demonstrate changes in the 
microbiota and the relationships between nutrients in children with celiac 
disease (CD) who followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). A group of 11 children who 
were recently diagnosed with CD, ranging in age from 3 to 12, were monitored for 
a period of 6 months. GFD is designed based on the individual's specific energy 
and nutrient needs, with strict control over dietary adherence. Food 
consumption, blood, and fecal samples were taken. Fecal samples were put through 
16s rRNA sequencing. Microbial modifications were demonstrated using alpha 
diversity, beta diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NDMS), 
t-test, and metastats. Mean age was 6.4 ± 2.66 years and 54.5% were male 
participants. Serological parameters were negative after 6 months. Both 
unweighted (p = .019) and weighted (p = .021) Unifrac distances were higher 
before GFD, and differences were reliable according to NDMS analysis 
(stress = 0.189). The abundance of Bacteroides ovatus was increased (p = .014), 
whereas unidentified Lachnospiraceae, Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium 
Peptostreptococcus, and Dielma were decreased after GFD (p < .001). Associations 
between nutrients and several genera and species were identified. The presence 
of genus Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was inversely 
associated with fat intake after GFD (p < .01). Microbiota changes became 
evident over a period of 6 months. The presence or absence of small bacteria may

can potentially influence the microbial composition.

The gut serves as the body's main immunological and digestive system. 
Furthermore, host immunity is mostly managed there. Nutrients are further broken 
down and absorbed here. Numerous research investigations have shown evidence 
that inflammation, oxidative stress, impairment of the intestinal barrier, and 
imbalance in the gut microbiota can all contribute to a variety of intestinal 
illnesses and other issues, underscoring the growing significance of intestinal 
health concerns. Because of their high biological activity and lack of negative 
side effects, the organic food-derived chemicals known as brown algal 
polysaccharides-mainly fucoidan, laminaran, and alginate-have attracted a lot of 
attention from academics. Because of its many benefits, sodium alginate is one 
of the biopolymers that has garnered the greatest attention, research, and 
application. Carotenoids, which are found in our food, have several positive 
health effects. Their low solubility in water, oxidation susceptibility, 
chemical instability, accessibility, and restricted solubility in water, 
however, restrict their use in food and medicine. In this review and in 
overcoming these constraints, encapsulation might be helpful. Furthermore, the 
primary goal of our study is to provide a fresh perspective into the control and 
avoidance of intestinal diseases. It provides more potent alternatives to this 
system, clarifies the function of alginates in enhancing the encapsulation of 
carotenoids, and functions as a model for the synthesis of the intestinal 
protective agent fucoidan.

Zizhong Dongjian (ZZDJ) is one of the most famous and popular fermented 
vegetables in China. The aim of this study was to explore the microbial 
communities and volatile flavor compounds of ZZDJ during different fermentation 
periods, as well as to reveal the potential correlation between microbiota and 
flavor. A total of 84 volatile flavor compounds were detected in 0-year to 
3-year ZZDJ samples. Hydrocarbons were the most abundant flavor compounds in 
0-year and 1-year samples, while esters became the predominant flavor components 
in 2-year and 3-year samples. Furthermore, Loigolactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and 
Virgibacillus were most predominant bacteria during the fermentation process of 
ZZDJ. Interestingly, all the fungi identified were yeasts. Among them, 
Zygosaccharomyces and Symmetrospora dominated alternatively throughout the 
fermentation process of ZZDJ. Through analysis of relativity between flavor 
compounds and microorganism of ZZDJ, we found that Uncultured Pseudomonas sp., 
Virgibacillus sediminis, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, and Symmetrospora marina 
might play important roles in flavor information of ZZDJ.

Sarcopenia, as a disease characterized by progressive decline of quality, 
strength, and function of muscles, has posed an increasingly significant threat 
to the health of middle-aged and elderly individuals in recent years. With the 
continuous deepening of studies, the concept of gut-muscle axis has attracted 
widespread attention worldwide, and the occurrence and development of sarcopenia 
are believed to be closely related to the composition and functional alterations 
of gut microbiota. In this review, combined with existing literatures and 
clinical reports, we have summarized the role and impacts of gut microbiota on 
the muscle, the relevance between gut microbiota and sarcopenia, potential 
mechanisms of gut microbiota in the modulation of sarcopenia, potential methods 
to alleviate sarcopenia by modulating gut microbiota, and relevant advances and 
perspectives, thus contributing to adding more novel knowledge to this research 
direction and providing certain reference for future related studies.

This systematic review investigates the association between environmental 
pollutants and the risk of diarrhea, a critical public health issue, 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The review synthesizes 
findings from various studies that highlight the impact of contaminants such as 
pesticides, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
microplastics, and parabens on gastrointestinal health. Following PRISMA 
guidelines, a comprehensive literature search across databases including PubMed, 
Scopus, and Google Scholar yielded 496 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion 
criteria for detailed analysis. The results indicate a significant correlation 
between exposure to specific pollutants-particularly pesticides like 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PAHs, arsenic, cadmium, and 
microplastics-and increased incidences of diarrhea. Notably, studies revealed 
that prenatal exposure to DDT is linked to higher diarrhea rates among boys in 
urban settings, while pesticide exposure in childhood correlates with 
inflammatory bowel disease in adulthood. Mechanistically, these pollutants may 
disrupt gastrointestinal function through cholinergic effects and endocrine 
disruption, leading to altered gut motility and microbiome imbalances. Moreover, 
the review emphasizes the immunosuppressive effects of heavy metals such as 
mercury and cadmium, which compromise the immune response and increase 
susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections. Despite the identified 
associations, there is a notable gap in research regarding geographic 
distribution and pollutant impacts on health outcomes. The review underscores 
the necessity for public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to 
these environmental pollutants to mitigate their adverse health effects. In 
conclusion, this systematic review highlights the urgent need for further 
epidemiological studies in underrepresented areas to enhance our understanding 
of how environmental pollutants influence public health globally. 
Recommendations include rigorous monitoring of pollutant levels, public health 
initiatives to reduce exposure, and policies that restrict emissions of harmful 
substances. Addressing environmental pollution is crucial for mitigating 
diarrheal diseases and protecting vulnerable populations from its detrimental 
effects.

Plain Language Summary: Environmental polluatants (metals and non metals) are 
involved in diarrhea.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) today is limited to a small 
number of biomarkers. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is the product of reactions 
resulting from the degradation of dietary-free choline, phosphatidylcholine, and 
carnitine metabolism by the intestinal microbiota. Earlier studies showed his 
involvement in the pathogenesis of UC. To study the association of TMAO with 
clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic indicators of UC activity.
METHODS: an observational cross-sectional comparative study was conducted based 
on the NCJSC "KMU" clinic, Karaganda, Kazakhstan. High-performance liquid 
chromatography measured TMAO concentration in 63 patients with UC (age Me 37 
(30-52) and 38 healthy individuals (age Me 38 (28.5-49.5).
RESULTS: Median TMAO level in patients with UC-0.286 μmol/l was significantly 
lower than in the control group Me 0.646 μmol/l (p<0.0001). TMAO had significant 
differences in groups with clinically active and inactive colitis (P=0.003). 
TMAO correlated with disease activity by Montreal scale (r=-0.389, P=0.002) and 
severity of attack by Truelove-Witts (r=-0.301, P=0.027 respectively), patient's 
age (r=0.377, P=0.003), stool frequency (r=-0.427, P=0.001); laboratory 
parameters: WBC (r=-0.31, P=0.042), blood albumin (r=0.379, P=0.002) and fecal 
calprotectin (r=-0.314, P=0.022). TMAO did not differ between groups divided by 
the extent of the pathological process and endoscopic activity.
CONCLUSION: in patients with UC, TMAO levels decrease compared with healthy 
individuals and differences in groups depend on the disease activity. These 
results give reason to consider changes in TMAO levels as a potential marker of 
UC and the severity of its course.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess Jordanian pharmacists' knowledge of the 
human microbiome and the impact of their knowledge on their attitudes and 
practices toward antibiotics and probiotics.
METHODS: A self-administered survey was designed after reviewing the literature. 
Participants' demographics were collected, and questions to evaluate 
pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward antibiotic and probiotic 
dispensing were asked. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences V.26. Pearson correlations and one-way ANOVA were employed 
to calculate the significance of knowledge, attitudes, and practices. 
Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of the 333 respondents, around 75% (n=250) had a high level of general 
knowledge regarding the human gut microbiome. Almost equal proportions of 
participants had either intermediate or high levels of knowledge about the role 
of gut bacteria in health (n=164, 49.2%) (n=166, 49.8%), respectively, while 
almost two-thirds had an intermediate level of knowledge of the role of gut 
bacteria in disease (n=197, 59.2%). More than half of the participants had a 
positive attitude toward antibiotics, probiotics, and the human microbiome 
(n=179, 53.8%), and the majority (n=239, 71.8%) had an intermediate level of 
practice with them. There was a significant positive correlation between 
pharmacists' general knowledge of the human microbiome and their positive 
attitudes (r=0.306, p < 0.01) and practices (r=0.331, p < 0.01) toward 
antibiotics and probiotics.
CONCLUSION: Study results raise the importance of interventional educational 
measures to promote healthcare professionals' knowledge of the human microbiome 
and their potential beneficence on pharmacists' attitudes and practices 
regarding antibiotics and probiotics dispensing. The results also denote the 
urgent need for probiotics' clinical guidelines to ensure practice uniformity.

Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is prevalent among patients with 
colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to explore the anticancer roles of the 
fecal microbiota in inhibiting the progression of colorectal cancer and possible 
mechanisms. The intestinal microbial dysbiosis in CRC mice was significantly 
ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as indicated by the 
restored ACE index and Shannon index. The diameter and number of cancerous foci 
were significantly decreased in CRC mice treated with FMT, along with the 
restoration of the intestinal mucosal structure and the lessening of the gland 
arrangement disorder. Key factors in oxidative stress (TXN1, TXNRD1, and 
HIF-1α); cell cycle regulators (IGF-1, BIRC5, CDK8, HDAC2, EGFR, and CTSL); and 
a critical transcription factor of the innate immune signal pathway (IRF5) were 
among the repressed oncogenic targets engaged in the FMT treatment of CRC. 
Correlation analysis revealed that their expressions were positively correlated 
with uncultured_bacterium_o_Mollicutes_RF39, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and 
negatively correlated with Bacillus, Marvinbryantia, Roseburia, Angelakisella, 
Enterorhabdus, Bacteroides, Muribaculum, and genera of

BACKGROUND: Tongxieyaofang (TXYF) was a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
formula for the treatment of diarrhea with liver stagnation and spleen 
deficiency syndrome, but the potential targets and mechanisms have not been 
fully clarified. This study aims to explore the potential mechanisms of TXYF in 
alleviating diarrhea using network pharmacology and full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing.
METHODS: Network pharmacology was applied to identify bioactive compounds and 
potential targets involved in the role of TXYF in alleviating diarrhea. 
Meanwhile, a model of diarrhea with liver stagnation and spleen deficiency 
syndrome was constructed by intragastric administration of Folium senna extract 
combined with restraint and tail pinch stress. The effect of TXYF on intestinal 
mucosal microbiota of diarrhea mice was analyzed by full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis showed that kaempferol, wogonin, 
naringenin, and nobiletin were compounds associated with the efficacy of TXYF. 
TXYF may alleviate diarrhea via multiple BPs and pathways, including TNF 
signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway, which are involved in TCM-gut microbiota-host interactions. Then, we 
found that TXYF administration reshaped the diversity and composition of the 
intestinal mucosal microbial community of diarrhea mice. Lactobacillus, 
primarily Lactobacillus johnsonii, was enriched by the administration of TXYF. 
After TXYF administration, the abundance of Lactobacillus, particularly 
Lactobacillus johnsonii, was enriched.
CONCLUSION: Oral administration of TXYF may alleviate diarrhea through 
remodeling intestinal mucosal microbiota. Promoting the colonization of 
beneficial commensal bacteria in the intestinal mucosa through gut 
microbiota-host interactions may be a potential mechanism of TXYF in the 
treatment of diarrhea.

Many systemic diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and cardiovascular disease, are associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The oral 
and intestinal microbiota are directly connected anatomically, and communicate 
with each other through the oral-gut microbiome axis to establish and maintain 
host microbial homeostasis. In addition to directly, periodontal bacteria may 
also be indirectly involved in the regulation of systemic health and disease 
through the disturbed gut. This paper provides evidence for the role of 
periodontal bacteria in systemic diseases via the oral-gut axis and the 
far-reaching implications of maintaining periodontal health in reducing the risk 
of many intestinal and parenteral diseases. This may provide insight into the 
underlying pathogenesis of many systemic diseases and the search for new 
preventive and therapeutic strategies.

The role of GABA in type 1 diabetes.

Mick GJ(1), McCormick KL(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, 
AL, United States.

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic 
decarboxylase (GAD). The entero-pancreatic biology of GABA, which is produced by 
pancreatic islets, GAD-expressing microbiota, enteric immune cells, or ingested 
through diet, supports an essential physiologic role of GABA in the health and 
disease. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is uniquely concentrated 
in pancreatic β-cells. They express GAD65, which is a type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
autoantigen. Glutamate constitutes 10% of the amino acids in dietary protein and 
is preeminently concentrated in human milk. GABA is enriched in many foods, such 
as tomato and fermented cheese, and is an over-the-counter supplement. Selected 
microbiota in the midgut have the enzymatic capacity to produce GABA. Intestinal 
microbiota interact with gut-associated lymphoid tissue to maintain host 
defenses and immune tolerance, which are implicated in autoimmune disease. 
Although GABA is a widely known inhibitory neurotransmitter, oral GABA does not 
cross the blood brain barrier. Three diabetes-related therapeutic actions are 
ascribed to GABA, namely, increasing pancreatic β-cell content, attenuating 
excess glucagon and tamping down T-cell immune destruction. These salutary 
actions have been observed in numerous rodent diabetes models that usually 
employed high or near-continuous GABA doses. Clinical studies, to date, have 
identified positive effects of oral GABA on peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
cytokine release and plasma glucagon. Going forward, it is reassuring that oral 
GABA therapy has been well-tolerated and devoid of serious adverse effects.

Polysaccharides are one of the important components of the human diet, offering 
a wide range of biological activities, especially in improving inflammation in 
the digestive system and addressing metabolic diseases. Among all the reported 
bioactivities of polysaccharides, their regulation effects on intestinal 
function and bile acids (BAs) are gradually attracting the attention of more 
researchers. Bile acids, the main components of intestinal lipid digestive 
fluid, are also key signal factors for metabolic homeostasis and impact overall 
health. Polysaccharides usually interact directly or indirectly with the gut and 
gut microbiota to participate in the regulation process of reabsorption, 
metabolism, and excretion of bile acids in humans, thereby exerting their role 
in the intervention of human diseases. In this review, we comprehensively 
reviewed the effects of bioactive polysaccharides on the regulation of 
intestinal function and bile acids. The chemical structures, bioactivities, and 
potential mechanisms for their activities were also reviewed. This study aimed 
to provide a comprehensive reference for future research on the activities and 
mechanisms of polysaccharides, as well as to offer important strategies and 
insights for the development of bioactive polysaccharides to prevent 
inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a form of kidney damage resulting from diabetes 
and represents a common, severe complication of the disease. Globally, DKD is a 
leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). DKD occurs in both type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes patients, with early clinical manifestations including 
microalbuminuria and hypertension. As the condition progresses, symptoms such as 
massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and severe edema may appear. The key to 
treating DKD lies in controlling blood glucose and blood pressure, reducing 
proteinuria, and slowing the deterioration of kidney function. Acupuncture, a 
traditional Chinese medicine treatment, has shown some therapeutic effects on 
DKD through mechanisms such as regulating blood glucose, improving renal blood 
flow and microcirculation, antioxidation and anti-inflammation, and modulating 
gut microbiota.

This trial was conducted to assess the effects of different levels of dietary 
fish oil on growth performance, hepatic health, nonspecific immune responses, 
and intestinal microbial community of Amur grayling (Thymallus grubii). Five 
isonitrogenous diets containing 60 (6FO), 90 (9FO), 120 (12FO), 150 (15FO), and 
180 g/kg (18FO) fish oil were fed to triplicate groups of 60 fish per tank for 8 
weeks, respectively. The results revealed that specific growth rate (SGR) and 
weight gain (WG) of fish in the 15FO group were significantly greater than those 
in the 6FO group (p < 0.05). Somatic indices and whole-body lipid levels were 
positively correlated with increases in dietary fish oil levels. Trypsin and 
lipase activities in 15FO and 18FO groups were significantly higher than those 
in the 6FO and 9FO groups (p < 0.05). The activities of intestinal catalase 
(CAT) and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, lysozyme (LZM), alkaline 
phosphatase (AKP), and acid phosphatase (ACP) improved significantly as the 
dietary lipid content increased to 185.3 g/kg and decreased thereafter (p < 
0.05). The lipid metabolism-related genes peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma (PPARγ) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were 
significantly downregulated and upregulated (p < 0.05), respectively, in the 
15FO group. Immune-related genes in the liver and intestine, such as interleukin 
(IL-8), were significantly upregulated in the 15FO group (p < 0.05). The liver 
sections from 18FO group presented more numerous and larger lipid vacuoles. Both 
low- (6FO) and high-lipid (18FO) diets reduced the relative abundance of 
intestinal Lactococcus. The relative abundances of intestinal Staphylococcus and 
Bacillus (mainly Bacillus anthracis) increased in the low-lipid diet group and 
that of Pedobacter increased in the high-lipid diet group. Second-order 
polynomial analysis of WG and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) for varying levels 
of dietary lipid revealed that a range of 194.76-198.90 g/kg dietary lipid was 
optimal for the growth and health of Amur grayling.

Staphylococcus saccharolyticus, an anaerobic coagulase-negative staphylococcal 
species, is a member of the normal skin microbiota. It can be a rare cause of 
human infectious disease and is usually considered a contaminant, but some rare 
reports have described deep-seated infections caused by S. saccharolyticus. 
Intracranial subdural empyema, a life-threatening condition that requires early 
diagnosis and emergency intervention, can be caused by various pathogens. A 
54-year-old man with no pre-existing medical conditions other than hypertension 
was transferred to our emergency department because of progressively worsening 
consciousness impairment. As non-contrast head computed tomography revealed 
hematoma-like collection in the subdural space, urgent drainage was performed 
via multiple burr holes. Perioperative tissue culture yielded monomicrobial 
growth of S. saccharolyticus after 4 days. Meropenem was administered in the 
immediate postoperative period, and later replaced with Penicillin G for six 
weeks. The patient is now in good clinical condition more than 18 months after 
treatment. This represents the first reported case of subdural empyema caused by 
S. saccharolyticus in an immunocompetent adult patient with a review of the 
pertinent literature. S. saccharolyticus should be added to the list of 
anaerobic microorganisms that can to cause subdural empyema. Prolonged anaerobic 
culture is critical to improve the yield of this possibly underestimated 
pathogen.

BACKGROUND: Coronary thrombosis events continue to be the leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently, emerging evidence has highlighted 
the role of gut microbiota in cardiovascular disease, but few studies have 
systematically investigated the gut microbiota variation associated with 
atherothrombosis.
METHODS: We conducted multi-omics analysis (metagenomics sequencing and serum 
metabolomics) on 146 subjects from Peking Union Medical College 
Hospital-Coronary Artery Disease (PUMCH-CAD) cohort. We analyzed the key strains 
and metabolic pathways related to coronary artery disease (CAD) development, 
explored the bacterial functional pathway which contributes to atherothrombosis 
at strain level in depth. Single strain colonization procedures on germ free 
mice demonstrated the promotion of platelet activation and thrombotic phenotypes 
of the disordered gut microbiota.
RESULTS: Gut microbiome and serum metabolome shifts were apparent in cases of 
CAD progression, Bacteroides spp. disturbed the development of CAD by 
participating in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), menaquinone and methanogenesis 
pathways. Particularly, coronary thrombosis is characterized by increased 
circulatory levels of L-tryptophan, which correlate with Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron that has enriched biosynthetic potential. In germ free mice we 
demonstrate that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron colonization could induce 
thrombosis, aggravate platelet hyperreactivity and augment fecal levels of 
L-tryptophan.
CONCLUSIONS: The disordered gut microbiota of CAD contributed to the occurrence 
and development of atherothrombosis. The key members of the bacterial and 
metabolic features may become biomarkers for predicting the cardiovascular 
thrombosis event. Targeting the microbial pathway may have the potential to 
reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disorders.

PURPOSE: Xiangqin Jiere Granules (XQJRG), a Chinese patent medicine used to 
treat acute fever in children caused by colds, seasonal flu, and coronavirus 
disease 2019 has been proven to have antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects 
in young febrile rats. Fever is known to affect the host-gut microbiota 
crosstalk. However, the pharmacological mechanism of XQJRG in this regard 
remains unclear.
METHODS: This study utilized a young febrile rat model previously reported by 
our team and extended the rat body temperature monitoring period following drug 
administration to explore the differences in efficacy between XQJRG and the 
commonly used pediatric antipyretic ibuprofen. Subsequently, the colonic 
contents of rats were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted 
metabolomics. The short-chain fatty acid content was quantified using 
high-throughput targeted metabolomics. The expression of short-chain fatty acid 
receptors and pro-inflammatory genes in the colonic tissue was evaluated using 
quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: XQJRG showed a longer antipyretic duration than ibuprofen. XQJRG 
improved dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in young febrile rats, bringing 
its flora composition closer to that of normal rats. It significantly increased 
the relative abundance of s_Phascolarctobacterium_faecium and s_Roseburia_sp. 
related to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the contents of 
butyric acid and nonanoic acid and protein levels of SCFAs receptor GPR41. 
Moreover, XQJRG significantly increased the levels of metabolites with 
anti-inflammatory effects, reduced the contents of metabolites directly 
associated with fever, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
interleukin-1β and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the colon of young febrile 
rats to normal levels.
CONCLUSION: XQJRG exhibited a more stable and persistent antipyretic effect in 
young febrile rats compared to ibuprofen. Its mechanism was at least partially 
attributed to regulating intestinal flora disorders, increasing 
anti-inflammatory metabolites, and inhibiting the production of inflammatory 
factors in young febrile rats.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by T 
cell-mediated pancreatic β cell loss, resulting in lifelong absolute insulin 
deficiency and hyperglycaemia. Environmental factors are recognized as a key 
contributor to the development of T1D, with the gut serving as a primary 
interface for environmental stimuli. Recent studies have revealed that the 
alterations in the intestinal microenvironment profoundly affect host immune 
responses, contributing to the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D. However, the 
dominant intestinal immune cells and the underlying mechanisms remain 
incompletely elucidated. In this review, we provide an overview of the possible 
mechanisms of the intestinal mucosal system that underpin the pathogenesis of 
T1D, shedding light on the roles of both non-classical and classical immune 
cells in T1D. Our goal is to gain insights into how modulating these immune 
components may hold potential implications for T1D prevention and provide novel 
perspectives for immune-mediated therapy.

INTRODUCTION: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve 
chronic diseases. Probiotics have been found to have similar effects. However, 
the additive effects of HIIT in combination with probiotics supplementation are 
unclear. The aim of current study was to investigate whether there were additive 
effects when implementing both HIIT and probiotics simultaneously.
METHODS: Forty-seven obese middle-aged women (Age: 44.5 ± 5.94 years, body fat 
percentage: 40.0 ± 4.1%) were recruited and assigned into four groups: control 
group (C, n = 12), probiotics group (P, n = 12), HIIT group (H, n = 11), and 
HIIT with probiotics group (HP, n = 12). All the participants consumed 
probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TWK10, 6 × 1010 CFU/day) or placebo 
supplements daily. Exercise intervention groups conducted HIIT training (85-90% 
vVO2max for 2 min, followed by a 1-min inactive rest interval, repeated for 7 
cycles) 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. Anthropometry, cardiorespiratory 
endurance, blood glucose, and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 
the 8-week intervention.
RESULTS: After the intervention, there were significant changes between groups 
in the variations and rates of change in waist circumference, hip circumference, 
and TTE. The waist circumference in group H significantly increased compared to 
groups C and P, while group HP did not show significant difference compared to 
group C. On the other hand, the hip circumference decreased significantly in 
group HP compared to group C, and the decreased rate in group HP was 
significantly greater than in groups C and P. Furthermore, the increase rates in 
TTE were higher in group H and HP compared to group C.
CONCLUSION: HIIT improves TTE but negatively affects waist circumference 
compared to the control group. However, when combined with probiotics, the 
probiotics not only help enhance TTE but also counteract the negative impact on 
waist circumference and further reduce hip circumference, resulting in a 
synergistic effect.

SCOPE: Human milk (HM) is rich in bioactive compounds and essential nutrients. 
While research has focused on lipids, minerals, immune markers, microbiota, and 
oligosaccharides, specific metabolites are less studied. This study uses 
targeted metabolomics to identify and quantify metabolites in HM and explores 
the impact of perinatal and dietary factors on the metabolomic profile.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cross-sectional study of 123 healthy lactating women, 
HM samples were collected up to 1 month postpartum and analyzed using the 
Biocrates MxP Quant 500 kit. Maternal and neonatal clinical, anthropometric, and 
nutritional data were collected. A total of 432 metabolites were quantified and 
categorized into 20 groups. The metabolomic profiles formed three distinct 
clusters, primarily driven by triglyceride concentration differences. 
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were higher in HM from mothers with vaginal 
delivery compared to C-section births and differences in hexoses were found 
between exclusive and mixed-feeding practices. Maternal diets rich in lipids and 
animal proteins were associated with elevated amino acids, sphingolipids, and 
glycosyl-ceramides.
CONCLUSION: The HM metabolome was grouped into three clusters influenced by 
delivery mode, lactation practices, and maternal diet. This comprehensive 
analysis opens new avenues to explore HM composition and offers valuable 
insights for future dietary interventions aimed at modulating HM.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is 
a growing health concern and the risk of its development is connected with the 
increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which occurs as a result of 
some complex obesity-induced metabolic changes. It is a common chronic liver 
disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, the tendency 
to progress to more severe forms, and a corresponding increase in morbidity and 
mortality. Thus, effectively addressing the rising burden of the disease 
requires a thorough understanding of its complex interrelationship with obesity 
and MetS.
MAIN BODY: MASLD results from complex interactions involving obesity, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidaemia, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, and is 
influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as diet and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis. It has extensive metabolic and non-metabolic implications, 
including links to MetS components like hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and 
dyslipidaemia, and progresses to significant liver damage and other 
extra-hepatic risks like cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Diagnosis 
often relies on imaging and histology, with non-invasive methods preferred over 
liver biopsies. Emerging biomarkers and OMIC technologies offer improved 
diagnostic capabilities but face practical challenges. Advancements in 
artificial intelligence (AI), lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological 
treatments show promise, with future efforts focusing on precision medicine and 
novel diagnostic tools to improve patient outcome.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development 
of MASLD within the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is essential for 
identifying potential therapeutic targets. Advancements in non-invasive 
diagnostic tools and novel pharmacological treatments, hold promise for 
improving the management of MASLD. Future research should focus on precision 
medicine and innovative therapies to effectively address the disease and its 
consequences.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating 
neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive loss of motor neurons. 
Recent insights into ALS pathogenesis underscore the pivotal role of the gut 
microbiome, prompting an investigation into the potential therapeutic impact of 
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on sporadic ALS patients.
METHODS: Conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
randomized clinical trial, the study enrolled 27 participants from October 2022 
to April 2023. The participants were followed up for 6 months from February 2023 
to October 2023, during in-person visits at baseline, week 15, week 23, and week 
35. The participants, evenly randomized, received either healthy donor FMT (FMT, 
n = 14) or a mixture of 0.9% saline and food coloring (E150c) as sham 
transplantation (placebo, n = 13). The primary outcome measured the change in 
the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score from baseline to 
week 35. Secondary outcomes included changes in gastrointestinal and respiratory 
functions, muscle strength, autonomic function, cognition, quality of life, 
intestinal microbiome composition, and plasm neurofilament light chain protein 
(NFL). Efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat 
population.
RESULTS: A total of 27 randomized patients (47% women; mean age, 67.2 years), 24 
participants completed the entire study. Notably, ALSFRS-R score changes 
exhibited no significant differences between FMT (6.1 [SD, 3.11]) and placebo 
(6.41[SD, 2.73]) groups from baseline to week 35. Secondary efficacy outcomes, 
encompassing respiratory function, muscle strength, autonomic function, 
cognition, quality of life, and plasm NFL, showed no significant differences. 
Nevertheless, the FMT group exhibited improvements in constipation, depression, 
and anxiety symptoms. FMT induced a shift in gut microbiome community 
composition, marked by increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, which persisted 
until week 15 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.28; p = 0.01). Gastrointestinal adverse events 
were the primary manifestations of FMT-related side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical trial involving 27 sporadic ALS patients, FMT did 
not significantly slow the decline in ALSFRS-R score. Larger multicenter 
trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of FMT in sporadic ALS patients and to 
explore the underlying biological mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome has been reported to induce epigenetic 
modifications in the host, which may be involved in the pathophysiology of 
metabolic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome in subjects with different metabolic characteristics.
METHODS: Sixty-four participants with different metabolic characteristics (i.e., 
participants without obesity -healthy controls-, and participants with obesity 
and normal insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance/ type 2 diabetes-T2DM-) were 
included in this study. A machine learning approach was performed in order to 
identify distinctive patterns in three omics (gut microbiome, blood DNA 
methylome, and visceral adipose tissue-VAT- DNA methylome) according to the 
different study groups.
RESULTS: Robust distinctive distribution patterns of the three different omics 
were found between healthy controls and patients with obesity; participants with 
and without T2DM, and patients with obesity with and without insulin resistance. 
Importantly, strong correlations between the gut microbiome (including 
Odoribacteriaceae and Christensenllaceae families) and both blood and VAT DNA 
methylome were found. Moreover, in the entire study population, three main 
bacterial genera (Sutterella, Collinsella and Eubacterium) were related to the 
epigenetic regulation of different genes involved in distinct processes related 
to cellular metabolism and metabolic diseases, including small ubiquitin-related 
modifier (SUMO) transferase activity or lipid binding.
CONCLUSION: We show that distinctive interactions between the gut microbiome and 
DNA methylome may occur in subjects with different metabolic characteristics. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of these interactions 
in the pathophysiology of obesity and related comorbidities.

In 2023, the World Obesity Atlas Federation concluded that more than 50% of the 
world's population would be overweight or obese within the next 12 years. At the 
heart of this epidemic lies the gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem that 
profoundly influences obesity-related metabolic health. Its multifaced role 
encompasses energy harvesting, inflammation, satiety signaling, gut barrier 
function, gut-brain communication, and adipose tissue homeostasis. Recognizing 
the complexities of the cross-talk between host physiology and gut microbiota is 
crucial for developing cutting-edge, microbiome-targeted therapies to address 
the global obesity crisis and its alarming health and economic repercussions. 
This narrative review analyzed the current state of knowledge, illuminating 
emerging research areas and their implications for leveraging gut microbial 
manipulations as therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat obesity and related 
disorders in humans. By elucidating the complex relationship between gut 
microflora and obesity, we aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge 
underpinning this critical field, potentially paving the way for novel 
interventions to combat the worldwide obesity epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the subgingival microbiota in subjects with stage 
I/II periodontitis (moderate periodontitis, MP), stage III/IV periodontitis 
(severe periodontitis, SP), and periodontal health (PH) at the same probing 
depth (PD) (shallow ≤ 3 mm, moderate 4-6 mm, or deep ≥ 7 mm), and to investigate 
the changes associated with probing depth progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 
subjects (16 MP, 17 SP and 17 PH), forming six groups: PHS (PH, shallow), MPS 
(MP, shallow), MPM (MP, moderate), SPS (SP, shallow), SPM (SP, moderate), and 
SPD (SP, deep). Samples were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.
RESULT: The subgingival microbiome showed significant differences associated 
with both PD and periodontitis stage (p < 0.05). With increasing PD, alpha 
diversity initially increased and then decreased. Pathogenic genera like 
Fusobacterium, Filifactor, and Porphyromonas increased, while health-associated 
genera like Streptococcus and Haemophilus decreased. At shallow sites, the PHS, 
MPS, and SPS groups showed similar community structure. At moderate and deep 
sites, the SPM and SPD groups exhibited significant differences in community 
structure compared to the MPM group, with the SPM and SPD groups showing 
decreased abundances of Actinomyces and increased abundances of Treponema. The 
microbial co-networks in the SPD and SPM groups exhibited greater complexity and 
connectivity and were more resilient to random microbial or node removal.
CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiome shows strong associations with PD and 
periodontitis stage.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Once periodontitis progresses to stage III/IV, 
reconstructing a healthy subgingival microbiome may be challenging, emphasizing 
the importance of early prevention.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the indicators of an animal model of gouty arthritis (GA) 
with dampness heat accumulation and the intervention effect of Tongfeng Qingxiao 
formula (, TFQXF).
METHODS: Seventy-two healthy adult Sprague?Dawley male rats were selected and 
randomly divided into a normal group, model group, low-dose group, medium-dose 
group, high-dose group, and diclofenac group using a random number table method, 
with 12 rats in each group. After group intervention, the general condition of 
the rats in each group was monitored and recorded, and the swelling index was 
measured. After separating the serum, the changes in glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), carbamide (UREA), 
creatinine (CREA), triglyceride (TG), total serum cholesterol (TC), low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C) in the serum of the rats in each group were measured using an automatic 
biochemical analyzer. The levels of motilin (MTL), gastrin (GAS), endothelin 
(ET), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), 
interleukin (IL)-1β, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) in the serum of the rats 
in each group were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
kits. Kidney tissues were used to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression of 
aquaporin (AQP) 1 and AQP2. Colon tissue was used to evaluate the protein and 
mRNA expression of AQP3 and AQP4 by Western blotting (WB) assay and real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT?qPCR). The levels of ALT, AST, UREA, 
and CREA were used to evaluate the liver and kidney function of rats. The levels 
of MTL and GAS were used to evaluate the gastrointestinal function of rats. The 
levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4 were used to evaluate 
the "dampness" syndrome performance in rats. The levels of ET, CGRP, and HSP70 
were used to evaluate the "heat" syndrome performance in rats. The levels of 
IL-1β and NF-κB were used to evaluate the degree of inflammation in rats. The 
pathological changes in synovial and colonic tissues were observed by 
hematoxylin and eosin staining.
RESULTS: Except for the normal group, after modeling treatment, the ankle joint 
of rats in both the model group and drug treatment groups gradually swelled, 
reaching a peak at 12 h, and then gradually began to subside. The results of 
biochemical analyzer detection indicated that the serum ALT, AST, UREA, CREA, 
TG, TC and LDL-C levels were significantly higher, but the HDL-C level was 
significantly lower in the rats of the model group than in the rats of the 
normal group (P < 0.05). The serum ALT, AST, UREA, CREA, MTL, TC and LDL-C 
levels were significantly lower, but the HDL-C level was significantly higher in 
the rats of all drug treatment groups than in the rats of the model group (P < 
0.05). The results of ELISA detection indicated that the MTL, GAS, ET, HSP70, 
IL-1β, and NF-κB levels were significantly higher, but the CGRP level was 
significantly lower in the rats of the model group than in the rats of the 
normal group (P < 0.05). The levels of MTL, GAS, ET, HSP70, IL-1β, and NF-κB 
were significantly lower, but CGRP was significantly higher in the rats of the 
drug treatment groups than in the rats of the model group (P < 0.05). The 
results of WB and RT-qPCR indicated that compared to the normal group, the 
levels of AQP1 and AQP2 in the model group were significantly higher in the 
kidney tissue, whereas the levels of AQP3 and AQP4 were significantly lower in 
the colon tissue (P < 0.05). Compared to those in the model group, the levels of 
AQP1 and AQP2 in the drug treatment groups were significantly lower in the 
kidney tissue, whereas the levels of AQP3 and AQP4 were significantly higher in 
the colon tissue (P < 0.05). In the model group, erosion of the colonic mucosal 
surface and inflammatory exudate occurred. Some mucosal epithelium had fallen 
off, the number of glands in the lamina propria was lower, many inflammatory 
cells infiltrated the interstitial layer, the connective tissue in the submucosa 
became loose and edematous, and lymph follicles developed. We found a 
significant proliferation of synovial cells in the ankle joint, an increase in 
cell density and neovascularization, and visible infiltration of inflammatory 
cells. The cartilage surface was not smooth. However, each drug group could 
improve the pathological changes in intestinal and synovial tissues to varying 
degrees.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood lipid metabolism indexes and AQPs could be used as objective 
evaluation indexes for the "dampness" syndrome performance of damp-heat 
accumulation type GA. ET, HSP70 and CGRP could be used as objective evaluation 
indexes for the "heat" syndrome performance, and the immune inflammation index 
could be used as objective evaluation indexes for the inflammation degree. The 
overall efficacy of TFQXF in the treatment of damp-heat accumulation-type GA 
could be determined by adjusting the above objective evaluation indexes. It 
provided some ideas and directions for clinical risk assessments and drug 
development of GA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate composition of gut microbial community in a rat model 
of functional dyspepsia (FD) and to explore the interventional effects of Simo 
Tang (, SMT).
METHODS: A rat model of FD was established through the tail-clamping stimulation 
method. The rat model of FD was assessed by the state of rats, their weight, 
sucrose preference rate, and intestinal propulsion rate. The DNA was extracted 
from stool samples after treatment with SMT. Amplified polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) products of the 16S rDNA were sequenced using NovaseQ6000 after 
construction of libraries. Composition of gut microbial community in the stool 
samples was determined and analyzed by cluster analysis, bioinformatic analysis, 
and analysis of α-diversity and β-diversity.
RESULTS: The rat model of FD was successfully established using the 
tail-clamping stimulation method. The statistical results of cluster analysis of 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed that the relative abundance of OTUs in 
the FD group was the lowest, while it was the highest in the normal (N) group. 
The composition of microbiome in the four groups was similar at phyla level. 
Compared with the FD group, the abundance of Firmicutes was downregulated, and 
the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was upregulated in the Simo 
Tang (SMT) and high-dose Simo Tang (SMT.G) groups. The ratio of Bacteroidetes/ 
Firmicutes was also elevated. According to the analysis of α-diversity and 
β-diversity, the abundance of flora in FD rats was significantly reduced. The 
treatment using SMT appeared beneficial to improve the diversity of flora. SMT 
could improve the intestinal flora in FD rats. The results showed that FD rats 
had intestinal flora imbalance, and species diversity increased. The results 
suggested that SMT could regulate the disorders of intestinal flora caused by 
FD.
CONCLUDIONS: SMT could restore gut homeostasis and maintain gut flora diversity 
by modulating the gut microbiota and its associated metabolites in rats, thereby 
treating gastrointestinal diseases.

The skin and gut microbiota are crucial to amphibians. Triadimefon (TF), a 
widely used triazole fungicide, controls crop diseases and regulates growth, 
with uncertain effects on amphibian microbiota. Contamination, typically 
involving mixed chemicals at low concentrations, including cadmium (Cd) and TF, 
may detrimentally affect amphibian growth, survival, and microbiota health in 
both the skin and gut, but few research has examined these consequences. This 
research examines the impact of Cd and TF on Rana dybowskii tadpoles, focusing 
on survival, body mass, and microbiome changes over 28 days across four groups: 
control, Cd, TF, and Cd + TF groups. Results showed significant reductions in 
survival and body mass in Cd and TF-treated groups, with the combination group 
being the most affected. Microbiota analysis revealed significant dysbiosis in 
both gut and skin microbiomes under pollutant stress, with a marked microbiota 
and a shift in dominant microbial communities. Function prediction analysis 
based on the microbiome composition highlighted significant differences across 
various biological pathways, including metabolism, immune system, environmental 
adaptation, and disease resistance. These alterations suggest that pollutant 
exposure compromises the tadpoles' ability to maintain homeostasis and resist 
pathogens. In conclusion, this study reveals the detrimental effects of Cd and 
TF on the survival, growth, and microbiomes of R. dybowskii tadpoles, indicating 
significant environmental and health risks.

The relationship between the gut microbiome and ocular health has garnered 
increasing attention within the scientific community. Recent research has 
focused on the gut-eye axis, examining whether imbalances within the gut 
microbiome can influence the development, progression and severity of ocular 
diseases, including dry eye disease, uveitis, and glaucoma. Dysbiosis within the 
gut microbiome is linked to immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and 
epithelial barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to ocular pathology. 
This review synthesises current evidence on these associations, exploring how 
gut microbiome alterations drive disease mechanisms. Furthermore, it examines 
the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, including 
antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation, all 
of which aim to restore microbial balance and modulate immune responses. As the 
prevalence of these conditions continues to rise, a deeper understanding of the 
gut-eye axis may facilitate the development of novel, targeted therapies to 
address unmet needs in the management of ocular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Precision nutrition is based on the integration of individual´s 
phenotypical and biological characteristics including genetic variants, 
epigenetic marks, gut microbiota profiles and metabolites fingerprints as well 
as medical history, lifestyle practices, and environmental and cultural factors. 
Thus, nutriomics areas including Nutrigenomics, Nutrigenetics, Nutriepigenetics, 
Nutrimetabolomics, and Nutrimetagenomics have emerged to comprehensively 
understand the complex interactions between nutrients, diet, and the human 
body's molecular processes through precision nutrition.
SUMMARY: This document from the Ibero-American Network of Nutriomics and 
Precision Nutrition (RINN22; https://rinn22.com/) provides a comprehensive 
overview of the concepts of precision nutrition approaches to guide their 
application in clinical and public health as well as establish the position of 
RINN22 regarding the current and future state of precision nutrition.
KEY MESSAGES: The progress and participation of nutriomics to precision 
nutrition is an essential pillar for addressing diet-related diseases and 
developing innovative managing strategies, which will be promoted by advances in 
bioinformatics, machine learning and integrative software as well as the 
description of specific novel biomarkers. In this context, synthesizing and 
critically evaluating the latest developments, potential applications and future 
needs in the field of nutrition is necessary with a holistic perspective, 
incorporating progress in omics technologies aimed at precision nutrition 
interventions. This approach must address and confront healthy, social, food 
security, physically active lifestyle, sanitation and sustainability challenges 
with preventive, participatory, and predictive strategies of personalized, 
population and planetary nutrition for a precision tailored health.

Functional constipation (FC) is a common digestive disorder that affects 
patients' quality of life and is closely associated with intestinal tumors. This 
study used a cross-sectional design to assess the changes of intestinal flora 
and metabolites in different severities of FC patients through 16S rRNA 
sequencing and metabolomics analysis. Results showed that patients with severe 
FC had significantly higher clinical and anxiety scores compared to those in the 
mild and moderate groups. The species richness of intestinal microorganisms in 
the severe FC group was also significantly higher, and obvious differences in 
the flora composition existed. Specifically, the Bacteroidota was more abundant 
in the severe FC group, which was a characteristic feature distinguishing severe 
FC. Metabolomic analyses also revealed metabolite differences among patients 
with mild-to-moderate and severe FC, with the severe FC group showing increased 
enrichment in L-isoleucine biosynthesis and glycolysis metabolic pathways. The 
short-chain fatty acid-targeted metabolome suggested that a decrease in butyric 
acid might be related to worsening constipation. This study suggests that 
specific flora and metabolic pathways could serve as potential diagnostic and 
therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the development of new diagnostic 
and therapeutic approaches to improve the quality of life and therapeutic 
outcomes for FC patients.

BACKGROUND: The respiratory microbiota influences infant immune system 
maturation. Little is known about how perinatal, physiological, and 
environmental exposures impact the nasal microbiota in preterm infants after 
discharge, or nasal microbiota differences between preterm and healthy full-term 
infants.
METHODS: Nasal swabs (from 136 preterm and 299 full-term infants at mean 
postmenstrual age of 45 weeks from the prospective Basel-Bern Infant Lung 
Development cohort) were analyzed by 16S-rRNA gene amplification and sequencing 
(Illumina MiSeq). Associations were tested with multivariable linear regression 
and principal coordinate analysis.
RESULTS: Presence of older siblings in preterm infants was associated with 
β-diversity (PERMANOVA p = 0.001) and an increased abundance of Moraxella and 
Haemophilus. The nasal microbiota of preterm infants exhibited a distinct 
composition compared to that of full-term infants (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.014, 
p = 0.001), characterized by a reduced abundance of the Moraxella and 
Dolosigranulum genera (ANCOM-BC, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that, despite both infant groups having similar 
nasal microbiota patterns, there are some disparities which suggest that 
prematurity influences the initial microbiota colonization. In preterm infants 
the presence of older siblings had an effect on the nasal microbiota, whereas 
perinatal and early postnatal factors did not show significant effects.
IMPACT: Presence of older siblings affected the nasal microbiota of preterm 
infants. This study demonstrated that microbiota composition differs between 
full-term and preterm infants, with a lower abundance of Moraxella and 
Dolosigranulum in preterm infants. Examining the differences in nasal microbiota 
between preterm and full-term infants may contribute to understanding the 
trajectory of the bacterial component of the nasal microbiota of preterm 
infants.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease in preterm infants, is 
associated with inflammation and high oxygen exposure. However, the effects of 
antenatal inflammation and extended hyperoxia on the metabolome and microbiome 
remain unclear. In this study, pregnant rats received lipopolysaccharide or 
saline injections on gestational day 20 and were exposed to either 21 % or 80 % 
oxygen for 4 weeks post-birth. Analysis revealed an increase in Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with a decrease in Bacteroidetes in BPD 
rats. Metabolomic analysis identified 78 altered metabolites, primarily lipids, 
with enrichment in arginine biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, and primary 
bile acid biosynthesis in BPD rats. Integration analysis revealed strong 
correlations between intestinal microbiota and metabolites in BPD rats. These 
findings underscore the impact of antenatal inflammation and prolonged hyperoxia 
on gut microbiota and serum metabolome, suggesting their role in BPD 
pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Many observational studies have shown a close association between 
gut microbiota and the risk of various duodenal diseases. Therefore, we urgently 
explore the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota and some 
duodenal diseases, mainly including duodenal ulcers and duodenitis.
METHODS: We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using genetic 
instrumental variables for gut microbiota from GWAS and duodenal disease 
datasets. Causal relationships were examined using multiple MR methods with 
Bonferroni correction. Bayesian Weighted Mendelian Randomization (BWMR) assessed 
causal relationships, employing ELBO and weighted data. Reverse MR analysis was 
conducted on microbiota showing significant causal relationships with duodenal 
diseases.
RESULTS: Through MR analysis, we identified three gut microbiota that promote 
the occurrence of duodenal ulcers (family. Coriobacteriaceae: OR=1.003; 95% 
CI=1.0005-1.0056; p=0.016, genus.RuminococcaceaeUCG003: OR=1.006; 95% 
CI=1.002-1.007; p=0.002, order. Coriobacteriales: OR=1.003; 95% 
CI=1.0005-1.0056; p=0.016), one microbiota that inhibits the occurrence of 
duodenitis (family. Acidaminococcaceae: OR=0.994; 95% CI=0.988-0.999; p=0.046), 
and one microbiota that promotes the occurrence of duodenitis 
(genus..Eubacteriumcoprostanoligenesgroup: OR=1.006; 95% CI=1.0005-1.013; 
p=0.033). Further confirmation of the occurrence of duodenal ulcers and the 
production of family.Coriobacteriaceae and order.Coriobacteriales microbiota was 
obtained through reverse MR analysis, indicating that the occurrence of duodenal 
ulcers also promotes the growth of these microbiota.
CONCLUSION: Our study employs Mendelian randomization techniques to demonstrate 
a causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and duodenal ulcers and 
duodenitis. Additionally, our analysis suggests that duodenal ulcer occurrence 
promotes the growth of certain microbiota, emphasizing the intricate interplay 
between gut microbiota composition and these diseases.

For a long time, traditional medicine has acknowledged the gut's impact on 
general health. Contemporary science substantiates this association through 
investigations of the gut microbiota, the extensive community of microorganisms 
inhabiting our gastrointestinal system. These microscopic residents considerably 
improve digestive processes, nutritional absorption, immunological function, and 
pathogen defense. Nevertheless, a variety of gastrointestinal and 
extra-intestinal disorders can result from dysbiosis, an imbalance of the 
microbial composition of the gut microbiota. A groundbreaking discovery is the 
gut-brain axis, a complex communication network that links the enteric and 
central nervous system (CNS). This bidirectional communication allows the brain 
to influence gut activities and vice versa, impacting mental health and mood 
disorders like anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota can influence this 
communication by creating neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids, among 
other biochemical processes. These factors may affect our mental state, our 
ability to regulate our emotions, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis. This study aimed to explore the complex interrelationships between the 
brain and the gut microbiota. We also conducted a thorough examination of the 
existing understanding in the area of how microbiota affects social behaviors, 
including emotions, stress responses, and cognitive functions. We also explored 
the potential of interventions that focus on the connection between the gut and 
the brain, such as using probiotics to treat diseases of the CNS. This research 
opens up new possibilities for addressing mental health and neurological 
conditions in an innovative manner.

Our microbiota plays crucial roles in immune development and homeostasis and has 
been implicated in virtually all major diseases of the 21st century. 
Nevertheless, our understanding of the exact microbial functions that underlie 
these correlations remains extremely limited, due in large part to the 
difficulty of profiling cellular activities within non-model organisms and 
complex communities. Over the past decade, new flow cytometric approaches have 
been developed to distinguish specific microbial populations based on their 
interactions with metabolite analogs, modified biomolecules, and reactive 
compounds. By selecting and separating active microbes via 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, PRobe INcorporation for Targeted sequencing 
(PRINT-seq) has inspired innovative approaches to identify and characterize 
functional members of our microbiota. Here, we provide a broad overview of this 
evolving technology and summarize how this method has been recently employed as 
a diagnostic fingerprint for diverse microbial activities.

Previous studies have shown that the bacterial fertilizer Lactobacillus reuteri 
(LBR) significantly alleviates apple replant disease (ARD), but the mechanism 
behind its effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of 
key LBR metabolites on the rhizosphere microbial community. The biocontrol 
function of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) was examined and shown to be 
further enhanced after optimizing the fermentation conditions. The optimized 
fermentation conditions were found to generate intermediates involved in various 
plant metabolic pathways, leading to plant growth promotion, increased abundance 
of beneficial bacteria like Bacillus and Pseudomonas in the rhizosphere soil, 
and decreased abundance of pathogenic fungi. Through the isolation and 
identification of rhizosphere microorganisms, a strain of Pseudomonas monteilii 
with chemotaxis to EPS was isolated, which had growth promotion ability and 
effectively improved plant resistance and relieves ARD. To further understand 
the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect on soil pathogens of microbial 
aggregations and development in the rhizosphere driven by beneficial bacteria 
metabolites. These findings offer valuable technical insights for utilizing 
biocontrol bacteria metabolites in ARD management.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide and has become a global 
emergent disease. Probiotics have been reported to be effective in relieving 
colitis. Previous studies found ripened Pu-erh tea (RPT) promoted gut microbiota 
resilience against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice by 
increasing relative abundance of Lactobacillus. However, whether and how it 
alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice need to be explored. Here, we screened a 
probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii GLJ001 from feces of ripened Pu-erh tea 
(RPT)-administrated mice. In this study, L. johnsonii GLJ001 attenuated symptoms 
of DSS-induced colitis in mice, including weight loss, increased disease 
activity index (DAI), colon shortening and colon tissue damage, as well as high 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and disturbances of intestine barrier 
function. Furthermore, abundances of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing 
bacteria (i.e. Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa, Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis 
and Ruminococcus) were enhanced in the cecum of mice treated with L. johnsonii 
GLJ001, accompanying by an increase of SCFAs. It was also found that SCFAs 
inhibited mRNA expression of M1 macrophage markers (Inos and CD86), inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α and Il-1β) and SCFAs receptors (Gpr41 and Gpr43) induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in THP-1 cell line. 
Collectively, L. johnsonii GLJ001 prevented DSS-induced colitis in mice by 
inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization via gut microbiota-SCFAs axis, and can be 
administered for management of colitis.

The genus Ruminococcus is dominant in the human gut, but higher levels of some 
species, such as R. gnavus, R. torques, and R. bromii, have been linked to 
health or disease. In this study, we analyzed >9,000 Ruminococcus 
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reconstructed from >5,000 subjects and 
revealed significant links between the prevalence of some species/subspecies and 
geographic origin, age, lifestyle, and disease, with subspecies prevalent in 
specific subpopulations showing divergent metabolic potential. Furthermore, 
Ruminococcus species from Lachnospiraceae encoded for carbohydrate-active 
enzymes (CAZy) potentially involved in the metabolism of human N- and O-glycans, 
whereas those from Oscillospiraceae appear to be more adapted toward fiber 
metabolism. These new findings contribute to elucidating the potential 
functional role of Ruminococcus in specific lifestyles and diseases and to 
decipher the diversity and the adaptation of members of this genus to the human 
gut.

The human gut microbiome is a dynamic and intricate ecosystem, composed of 
trillions of microorganisms that play a pivotal role in maintaining overall 
health and well-being. However, the gut microbiome is constantly exposed to 
various environmental factors, including the bile produced by the liver, which 
can significantly impact its composition and function. Bile acids, secreted by 
the liver and stored in the gallbladder, modulate the gut microbiome, 
influencing its composition and function. This altered microbiome profile can, 
in turn, impact the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting an immunosuppressive 
environment that favors tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, changes in the 
gut microbiome can also influence the production of bile acids and other 
metabolites that directly affect cancer cells and their behavior. Moreover, bile 
acids have been shown to shape the microbiome and increase antibiotic 
resistance, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate relationships between bile, 
the gut microbiome, and the TME, highlighting the mechanisms by which this 
interplay drives cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Understanding 
these complex interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic 
strategies that target the gut-bile-TME axis and improve patient outcomes.

Microbiome modulation is one of the novel strategies in medicine with the 
greatest future to improve the health of individuals and reduce the risk of 
different conditions, including metabolic, immune, inflammatory, and 
degenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Regarding the latter, many studies 
have reported the role of the gut microbiome in carcinogenesis, formation and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its response to different 
systemic therapies. Likewise, obesity, one of the most important risk factors 
for CRC, is also well known for its association with gut dysbiosis. Moreover, 
obesity and CRC display, apart from microbial dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, 
which participates in their pathogenesis. Although human and murine studies 
demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in regulating energy 
metabolism and CRC development, little is understood about the contribution of 
the microbiome to the development of obesity-associated CRC. Therefore, this 
systematic review explores the evidence for microbiome changes associated with 
these conditions and hypothesizes that this may contribute to the pathogenesis 
of obesity-related CRC. Two databases were searched, and different studies on 
the relationship among obesity, intestinal microbiota and CRC in clinical and 
preclinical models were selected. Data extraction was carried out by two 
reviewers independently, and 101 studies were finally considered. Findings 
indicate the existence of a risk association between obesity and CRC derived 
from metabolic, immune, and microbial disorders.

The hepatoprotective potential of tomato juice (TJ) has been reported in chronic 
liver models, and its potential prebiotic properties may be key to its 
preventative effects. However, the mechanistic role of the gut microbiota and 
its derived metabolites in ameliorating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) via 
TJ remains unclear. In this study, we explored how TJ regulates gut microbiota 
and succinic acid (SA) to restore intestinal barrier function and thus suppress 
NASH progression. TJ supplementation effectively reduced serum lipid 
concentrations, alleviated endotoxin levels, and suppressed activation of the 
endotoxin-TLR4-NF-κB pathway in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced 
NASH mice. TJ restored the MCD diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased 
the abundance of short-chain fatty acid and SA-producing bacteria 
(Bifidobacterium, Ileibacterium, Odoribacter, and Parasutterella) and enhanced 
the expression of intestinal barrier-associated proteins (E-cadherin, Claudin-1, 
MUC-2, and ZO-1). The hepatoprotective and enteroprotective effects of TJ were 
abolished in an antibiotic-treated mouse model, underscoring the pivotal role of 
the gut microbiota in the beneficial effects of TJ on NASH. Fecal metabolomics 
demonstrated that TJ significantly upregulated the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 
pyruvate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism pathways, increasing levels of 
butyric acid (BA) and SA-metabolites associated with reduced hepatic steatosis 
and intestinal damage. We further found that the physiological concentration of 
SA, rather than BA, could reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) 
levels and enhance mucin proteins and tight junction markers in the LPS-induced 
colon cell line LS174T. This study uncovers new mechanisms by which TJ prevents 
NASH, highlighting the potential of TJ and SA as effective dietary supplements 
for patients with chronic liver diseases.

The rapidly expanding food industry necessitates the use of food additives to 
achieve specific purposes. However, this raises new concerns in food safety due 
to the reported negative impacts of food additives on gut microbiota and host 
health, particularly in the context of continuous worldwide urbanization. This 
review summarizes the existing studies on the effects of different types of 
commonly used food additives on gut microbiota alteration, intestinal barrier 
disruption, metabolism disorder, and neurobehavior changes. These food 
additives, including emulsifiers, low-calorie sweeteners, inorganic 
nanoparticles, and preservatives, have been found to exert multifaceted impacts, 
primarily adverse effects, highlighting the potential risks associated with food 
additive exposure in various chronic diseases. Further research is warranted to 
elucidate the specific mechanisms, determine the relevance of these findings to 
humans, and clarify the suitability of certain food additives for vulnerable 
populations. It is crucial to note that natural food additives are not 
inherently superior to synthetic ones in terms of safety. Rigorous evaluation is 
still warranted before their widespread application in the food industry. 
Additionally, the potential synergistic effects of commonly used food additives 
combination in specific food categories on gut microbiota and host metabolism 
should be investigated to understand their relevance in real-world scenarios.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in regulating human 
physiology, with dysbiosis linked to various diseases, including heart failure 
(HF). HF is a complex syndrome with a significant global health impact, as its 
incidence doubles with each decade of life, and its prevalence peaks in 
individuals over 80 years. A bidirectional interaction exists between GM and HF, 
where alterations in gut health can worsen the disease's progression.
MAIN BODY: The "gut hypothesis of HF" suggests that HF-induced changes, such as 
reduced intestinal perfusion and altered gut motility, negatively impact GM 
composition, leading to increased intestinal permeability, the release of 
GM-derived metabolites into the bloodstream, and systemic inflammation. This 
process creates a vicious cycle that further deteriorates heart function. 
GM-derived metabolites, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs), and secondary bile acids (BAs), can influence gene 
expression through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone 
modifications. These epigenetic changes may play a crucial role in mediating the 
effects of dysbiotic gut microbial metabolites, linking them to altered cardiac 
health and contributing to the progression of HF. This process is particularly 
relevant in older individuals, as the aging process itself has been associated 
with both dysbiosis and cumulative epigenetic alterations, intensifying the 
interplay between GM, epigenetic changes, and HF, and further increasing the 
risk of HF in the elderly.
CONCLUSION: Despite the growing body of evidence, the complex interplay between 
GM, epigenetic modifications, and HF remains poorly understood. The dynamic 
nature of epigenetics and GM, shaped by various factors such as age, diet, and 
lifestyle, presents significant challenges in elucidating the precise mechanisms 
underlying this complex relationship. Future research should prioritize 
innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. By identifying specific 
metabolite-induced epigenetic modifications and modulating the composition and 
function of GM, novel and personalized therapeutic strategies for the prevention 
and/or treatment of HF can be developed. Moreover, targeted research focusing 
specifically on older individuals is crucial for understanding the intricate 
connections between GM, epigenetics, and HF during aging.

The composition of human gut microbiota is dominated by bacteria which have been 
extensively studied. The role of intestinal eukaryote microorganisms like 
Blastocystis, however, remains under investigation. Moreover, the potential 
impact on gut health related to Blastocystis presence was primarily investigated 
in symptomatic individuals mainly from industrialized countries, and appears to 
be mostly beneficial to the host microbiota. Data from surveys conducted in 
underdeveloped countries with higher prevalence and from asymptomatic 
individuals could therefore be valuable. The aim of this preliminary study was 
to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota in relation to the protozoa 
Blastocystis ST1 and ST2 and Entamoeba hartmanni carriage in asymptomatic 
subjects living in a semi-urban area of Côte d'Ivoire to add data into the 
ongoing debate on the role of Blastocystis in host health. The amplification of 
the V3 and V4 regions of bacterial 16S rDNA genes was performed to obtain the 
gut microbiota composition, and differential analyses on alpha and beta 
diversity were performed from the phylum to genus taxonomic level. The analysis 
revealed that individuals positive for both protozoa exhibited higher alpha and 
beta diversity compared to those who tested negative. Additionally, their 
bacterial composition showed a reduction in Bacteroides and an increase in 
Prevotella 9. Relative abundances of some OTUs, particularly Faecalibacterium, 
observed in individuals who tested positive for protozoa, were correlated with a 
good state of health of the gut microbiota. Blastocystis ST1 and ST2 associated 
with E. hartmanni thus appeared to be related to a state of intestinal eubiosis.

BACKGROUND: The rapid establishment and persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs 
is one of the main obstacles towards an HIV cure. While antiretroviral therapy 
supresses viral replication, it does not eradicate the latent reservoir of 
HIV-1-infected cells. Recent evidence suggests that the human microbiome, 
particularly the gut microbiome, may have the potential to modulate the HIV-1 
reservoir. However, literature is limited and the exact mechanisms underlying 
the role of the microbiome in HIV immunity and potential regulation of the viral 
reservoir remain poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we review updated knowledge on the associations between the human 
microbiome and HIV reservoir across different anatomical sites, including the 
gut, the lungs and blood. We provide an overview of the predominant taxa 
associated with prominent microbiome changes in the context of HIV infection. 
Based on the current evidence, we summarize the main study findings, with 
specific focus on consistent bacterial and related byproduct associations. 
Specifically, we address the contribution of immune activation and inflammatory 
signatures on HIV-1 persistence. Furthermore, we discuss possible scenarios by 
which bacterial-associated inflammatory mediators, related metabolites and host 
immune signatures may modulate the HIV reservoir size. Finally, we speculate on 
potential implications of microbiome-based therapeutics for future HIV-1 cure 
strategies, highlighting challenges and limitations inherent in this research 
field.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent advances, this review underscores the need for 
further research to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between 
the human microbiome and HIV reservoir. Further integrative multi-omics 
assessments and functional studies are crucial to test the outlined hypothesis 
and to identify potential therapeutic targets ultimately able to achieve an 
effective cure for HIV.

BACKGROUND: Chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) has been linked to the 
development of atherosclerosis, although the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota disruption 
in CAP-induced atherosclerosis development, focusing on trimethylamine N-oxide 
(TMAO)-related metabolites.
METHODS: The study utilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to transfer 
gut microbiota from mice with CAP to healthy mice. Atherosclerosis development 
was assessed by analyzing lesions in the aortic arch and aortic root. Serum 
lipid and inflammatory factor levels were measured. Composition and diversity of 
gut microbiota were analyzed using targeted metabolomics, with a focus on the 
ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. The expression of hepatic 
flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) and serum TMAO levels were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Mice receiving gut microbiota from CAP mice showed increased 
atherosclerotic lesions compared to controls, without significant differences in 
serum lipid or inflammatory factor levels. Alterations in gut microbiota 
composition were observed, characterized by an increase in the Firmicutes to 
Bacteroidetes ratio. Peptostreptococcaceae abundance positively correlated with 
atherosclerosis severity, while Odoribacteraceae showed a negative correlation. 
No significant differences were found in hepatic FMO3 expression or serum TMAO 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the role of gut microbiota disruption in 
CAP-mediated atherosclerosis development, independent of serum lipid or TMAO 
levels. Alterations in gut microbiota composition, particularly increased 
Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and specific bacterial families, were 
associated with atherosclerosis severity. These findings highlight the intricate 
interplay between gut microbiota and cardiovascular health in the context of 
CAP.

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) subjects might have their microenvironment 
changed due to pathogenesis and living environment. Whether the nasal microbe in 
AR children differs from healthy subjects and how it interplays with dermal, 
oral and indoor dust microbe needs to be elucidated.
METHODS: In this case-control study, we analyzed and compared the bacterial 
characterization and associations in nasal, dermal, oral swab samples and dust 
samples in 62 children with physician-diagnosed AR(cases) and 51 age- and 
gender-matched healthy ones with no history of allergic diseases(controls). 
Full-length 16S rRNA sequencing(swabs) and shotgun metagenomics(dust) were 
applied. Bacterial diversity, composition, abundance difference characteristics 
and fast expectation-maximization for microbial source tracking(FEAST) analysis 
were performed and compared between cases and controls.
RESULTS: The α-diversity of dust microorganisms in AR was lower than that in 
control group (P = 0.034), and the β-diversity indices of microorganisms in 
nasal cavity (P = 0.020), skin (P = 0.001) and dust (P = 0.004) were 
significantly different from those in control group. At species levels, a total 
of 10, 15, 12, and 15 bacterial species were differentially enriched in either 
cases or controls in nasal, dermal, oral, and dust samples, respectively(Linear 
Discriminant Analysis(LDA) score > 2, P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis was 
the single species simultaneously more abundant in nasal, dermal and dust 
samples in AR children. By FEAST analysis, 8.85% and 10.11% of S. epidermidis in 
AR dermal and dust samples came from nasal cavity. These proportions were 
significantly higher than those in controls (2.70% and 3.86%) (P < 0.05). The 
same significantly higher transfer proportions(P < 0.05) were observed for 
Staphylococcus aureus enriched in the nasal cavity in AR children. 
Classification models by random forest regression at species levels showed, 
bacterial species enriched in indoor dust, nasal and dermal samples had 
substantial power in distinguishing AR children from healthy ones, with the 
highest power in the dust samples (AUC = 0.88) followed by nasal(AUC = 0.81) and 
dermal ones(AUC = 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented the microbial enrichment characteristics in AR 
children both in the living environment(dust) and body sites exposed to 
environment through inhalation(nasal cavity), contact(skin) and ingestion(oral

BACKGROUND: Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory cicatricial skin 
disease that can lead to urethral stricture or even malignant transformation and 
the etiology is still unknown. This study comparatively analyzed the 
balanopreputial swab and urine microbiota simultaneously between male patients 
with LS urethral stricture (LSUS) and non-LS urethral stricture (non-LSUS).
METHODS: We prospectively included 31 male patients with LSUS and 30 with 
non-LSUS in this case-control study. Midstream urine samples and balanopreputial 
swabs were collected from each patient for the 16S V3-V4 hypervariable region 
sequencing. Operational taxonomic units were defined using a > 97% sequence 
similarity threshold. We compared the differences in alpha diversity, beta 
diversity, and microbial structure between the two groups.
RESULTS: Whether in swab or urine samples, there was no significant difference 
in alpha diversity between the two groups. Swab samples showed a significant 
difference in beta diversity (p = 0.001). For all individuals, composition 
analyses showed that the most abundant phyla were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in both samples. Additionally, the microbial 
communities of swab samples were significantly more similar to the communities 
of urine samples in the LSUS group (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota showed significant variation between LSUS and non-LSUS 
groups, suggesting that microecological imbalance may be closely related to the 
occurrence of LS. Urinary irritation may be related to the unique microbiota on 
the genital skin of patients with LSUS.

Negative experiences during adolescence, such as social isolation (SI), 
bullying, and abuse, increase the risk of psychiatric diseases in adulthood. 
However, the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases induced by these factors 
remain poorly understood. In adolescents, stress affects the intestinal 
homeostasis in the gut-brain axis. This study determined whether adolescent SI 
induces behavioral abnormalities by disrupting colonic function. Adolescent mice 
exposed to SI exhibit spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in 
the hippocampus (HIP). SI decreased the differentiation of mucin-producing 
goblet cells, which was accompanied by alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiota, particularly the depletion of mucin-feeding bacteria. Treatment with 
rebamipide, which promotes goblet cell differentiation in the colon, attenuated 
SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in the HIP and 
decreased cystine, a downstream metabolite of homocysteine. Treatment with 
cystine ameliorated SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and increased 
microglial C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) levels in the HIP. Inhibition of 
CCL7 receptors by antagonists of CC motif chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 3 
(CCR3) in the HIP prevented spatial cognitive deficits induced by SI. Infusion 
of CCL7 into the HIP following microglial ablation with clodronate liposome 
induced spatial cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that adolescent SI 
decreases serum cystine levels by damaging the colonic goblet cells, resulting 
in spatial cognitive deficits by triggering microglial activation in the HIP. 
Our results indicate that increased CCL7 expression in hippocampal microglia may 
contribute to spatial cognitive deficits by activating CCR2 and CCR3.

OBJECTIVES: Gut-brain axis dysfunction has emerged as a key contributor to the 
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The elucidation of neural alterations may 
provide novel insights into its management. We aimed to develop a multiparameter 
brain MRI-based radiomics model (RM) for characterizing neural alterations in CD 
patients and to interpret these alterations using multiomics traits.
METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 230 CD patients and 46 healthy controls 
(HCs). Participants voluntarily underwent brain MRI and psychological assessment 
(n = 155), blood metabolomics analysis (n = 260), and/or fecal 16S rRNA 
sequencing (n = 182). The RM was developed using 13 features selected from 
13,870 first-order features extracted from multiparameter brain MRI in training 
cohort (CD, n = 75; HCs, n = 32) and validated in test cohort (CD, n = 34; HCs, 
n = 14). Multiomics data (including gut microbiomics, blood metabolomics, and 
brain radiomics) were compared between CD patients and HCs.
RESULTS: In the training cohort, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of RM for distinguishing CD patients from HCs was 
0.991 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.975-1.000). In test cohort, RM showed an 
AUC of 0.956 (95% CI, 0.881-1.000). CD-enriched blood metabolites such as 
triacylglycerol (TAG) exhibited significant correlations with both brain 
features detected by RM and CD-enriched microbiota (e.g., Veillonella). One 
notable correlation was found between Veillonella and 
Ctx-Lh-Middle-Temporal-CBF-p90 (r = 0.41). Mediation analysis further revealed 
that dysbiosis, such as of Veillonella, may regulate the blood flow in the 
middle temporal cortex through TAG.
CONCLUSION: We developed a multiparameter MRI-based RM that characterized the 
neural alterations of CD patients, and multiomics data offer potential evidence 
to support the validity of our model. Our study may offer clues to help provide 
potential therapeutic targets.
CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our brain-gut axis study developed a novel model 
using multiparameter MRI and radiomics to characterize brain changes in patients 
with Crohn's disease. We validated this model's effectiveness using multiomics 
data, making it a potential biomarker for better patient management.
KEY POINTS: Utilizing multiparametric MRI and radiomics techniques could unveil 
Crohn's disease's neurophenotype. The neurophenotype radiomics model is 
interpreted using multiomics data. This model may serve as a novel biomarker for 
Crohn's disease management.

Chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, is considered a valuable source of 
compounds in the feed and food industries. However, the impact of Hermetia 
illucens larvae chitosan (HCS) with specific physicochemical characteristics on 
obesity mediated by lipid accumulation and microbiome dysbiosis has not been 
fully elucidated. We purified HCS with a low molecular weight (84 kDa), low 
crystallinity, and a high deacetylation rate, characterizing it through several 
analytical techniques, including gel permeation chromatography, FT-IR, 1H NMR, 
FE-SEM, and XRD analysis. HCS effectively inhibited the differentiation of 
3T3-L1 preadipocytes by suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species. 
The adipogenic signaling of preadipocytes, mediated by the phosphorylation of 
mTOR and PPARγ, which are essential for the expression of fatty acid synthase, 
was attenuated by HCS. In mouse models fed high-fat diets, the oral 
administration of HCS prevented changes in white adipose tissue and liver weight 
and reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol. Additionally, the analysis of 
the microbiota using 16S rRNA revealed that HCS improved dysbiosis by modulating 
the composition and abundance of specific bacterial genera, including F. 
rodentium, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and L. murinus. These findings highlight the 
potential of HCS as a candidate for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is an 
urgent global health concern. Commensal Neisseria species in the oropharynx are 
an important reservoir of AMR genes that are transferred to NG, yet few data 
about AMR among commensal Neisseria in populations at risk for AMR exist.
METHODS: From May 2022 - December 2023, men in a HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis 
program in Hanoi, Vietnam, were recruited. Participants self-collected oral 
specimens using phosphate buffer solution (PBS), for culture on LB agar media 
containing sucrose, vancomycin and trimethoprim (LBVT.SNR). Oxidase-positive 
gram-negative diplococci were identified using Remel RapID NH system. Minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to azithromycin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, and 
doxycycline were determined using Etests.
RESULTS: There were 42 male participants, the median age was 26 years and 29% 
(n=12) reported using antibiotics in the past 6 months. In total, 48 Neisseria 
isolates were recovered; N. sicca/subflava was the most common species (50%; 
n=24), followed by N. mucosa (38%; n=18). For azithromycin, 85% (n=41) of 
isolates were resistant with MICs ≥1 ug/ml, including 25% (n=12) with high-level 
resistance (MICs ≥ 256 ug/mL of which 67% (8/12) were N. mucosa. Among 
non-gonococcal Neisseria isolates, the prevalence of resistance was 6% (n=3) for 
ceftriaxone, 6% (n=3) for cefixime, and 54% (n=26) for doxycycline; most 
non-susceptible isolates were N. mucosa.
CONCLUSION: A High frequency of azithromycin resistance, moderate doxycycline 
resistance, and low cephalosporin resistance was found in oropharyngeal 
Neisseria isolates from MSM in a PrEP program in Hanoi, Vietnam. N. mucosa was 
over-represented among resistant isolates.

Aspiration pneumonia (AP) remains a critical health issue, especially among 
older and hospitalized patients. This review focuses on understanding the 
epidemiology and pathogenesis of AP, exploring key risk factors, and proposing 
diagnostic strategies. Aspiration pneumonia is commonly associated with 
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), 
where pathogens introduced into the lungs from gastric aspiration cause 
infection. Several factors, such as oropharyngeal dysphagia, silent aspiration, 
and poor oral health, contribute to increased risk, especially in frail elderly 
populations with chronic comorbidities. Diagnostic criteria for AP are not 
well-defined, complicating accurate diagnosis. Radiographic evidence of 
pulmonary infiltrates, history of aspiration, and clinical symptoms, such as 
cough and fever, guide diagnosis, but the absence of specific biomarkers remains 
a challenge. Furthermore, the microbiome of the lung, which shares 
characteristics with the oropharyngeal flora, plays a pivotal role in the 
development of infection. The incidence of AP is likely to increase given the 
growing elderly population with factors predisposing them to aspiration. It is 
one of the most common types of pneumonia in older adults, with its prevalence 
estimated to range from 5% to 24% in cases of CAP admissions. This revision 
highlights the growing need for comprehensive diagnostic tools and treatment 
protocols for AP, especially in high-risk populations such as the elderly and 
those in long-term care. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and the role of 
silent aspiration can improve prevention strategies and reduce morbidity and 
mortality in these vulnerable groups.

Prenatal stress (PNS) has widespread effects on offspring, including aberrant 
immune development and behavioural deficits. The microbiome is a mediator of the 
dissemination of stress effects to the offspring through immunomodulation and 
metabolite production. Metabolites derived from the mother and their gut 
microbiota pass to the foetus and can affect immune and nervous development. 
Stress affects the abundance of such metabolites, including the tryptophan (Trp) 
pathway, which are involved in immune and nervous system function. We 
hypothesized that the PNS is associated with dysregulation of Trp metabolism. We 
further posited that treatment with a Trp-metaboliser Parasutterella 
excrementihominis would abrogate PNS-associated deleterious effects on offspring 
development. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice were exposed to restraint 
stress and administered P. excrementihominis (Dam n = 3-9; Offspring n = 5-10). 
PNS increased maternal gut Trp and both maternal and offspring inflammation. P. 
excrementihominis treatment reduced the PNS-induced excess pool of maternal gut 
Trp. Some PNS effects on foetal neuroinflammation were reduced in severity due 
to handling effects from bacterial gavage. However, P. excrementihominis was 
anti-inflammatory in dam and offspring and anxiolytic in offspring of Pe-treated 
dams. These data illustrate that elevated Trp levels are associated PNS and its 
downstream deleterious offspring inflammatory and behavioural outcomes while P. 
excrementihominis, a Trp-metabolizer, can ameliorate these effects and improve 
offspring outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease 
closely related to gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal homeostasis 
imbalance. Sishen Pill&Tongxieyaofang (SSP-TXYF) has a long history of 
application in traditional Chinese medicine and is widely used in UC clinics. 
However, its mechanism of action is still unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the potential regulatory role of SSP-TXYF 
in protecting against UC through metabolites produced by the intestinal 
microbiota, and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 16S rRNA and UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS were used to assess 
the microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). A rat model of 
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis was 
used to study the effects of SSP-TXYF on UC in vivo. Intestinal epithelial 
cells-6 (IEC-6) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The intestinal 
mucosal barrier (IMB) functions were investigated by alcian blue staining and 
western blot analysis. The mechanism of SSP-TXYF influenced the HIF-1α 
acetylation pathway was examined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR 
(qPCR), Western blotting, and Co-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Using 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis, we found that SSP-TXYF 
ameliorated TNBS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. We found that SSP-TXYF 
significantly inhibited the decreased abundance of Firmicutes in UC rats, in 
addition, the abundance of Actinobacteria was also improved. The mechanism of 
SSP-TXYF-treated TNBS-induced UC resulted from improved IMB functions via the 
activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) acetylation. Notably, SSP-TXYF 
Enriched microbiota-derived metabolites propionate and butyrate, which could 
activate HIF-1α acetylation in IEC. Furthermore, exogenous treatment of 
propionate and butyrate reproduced similar protective effects as SSP-TXYF to UC 
through improving HIF-1α-dependent IMB functions.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that the gut 
microbiota-propionate/butyrate-HIF-1α-IMB axis plays an important role in 
SSP-TXYF-maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which may represent a novel

Since animal growth promoters (AGPs) are used in large quantities and commonly 
released to the environment from animal farms, it is necessary to determine 
whether such agents should be regarded as an environmental toxin that poses a 
threat to the ecosystem and health risk to wildlife. In this study, a 
multi-omics approach was employed to explore the effects of a representative 
AGP, lincomycin, on key metabolic and physiological functions of animals, using 
a mouse model. The results indicated that exposure to lincomycin resulted in a 
significant increase in growth rate of mice (50.11 %) over an 8 weeks period, 
during which significant decrease (61.94 %) and increase (68.64 %) in the 
relative abundance of Firmicutes and Escherichia coli, respectively, was 
observed in the gut microbiota, indicating that the gut microbiota structure has 
been altered. Moreover, the mice exhibited altered lipid profiles and liver 
damage suggestive of early-stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Disruptions in blood glucose and insulin levels associated with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also observed. Furthermore, lincomycin was found to cause 
suppression in inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of 
related genes and elevated inflammatory mediators, potentially resulting in 
increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Our findings underscore the 
detrimental effects of lincomycin on animal health and highlight the necessity 
for comprehensive toxicological assessments of lincomycin and other AGPs before 
their environmental release.

A strong association exists between the high-fat diet (HFD) and the incidence of 
obesity, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease, affecting an increasing 
number of individuals. More and more research has shown that probiotics and gut 
microbiota play important roles in dietary absorption, metabolism, and general 
health of the host. This aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic 
effects and the underlying mechanisms of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TCCC11824 
(CGMCC 8198) on hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice and humans. First, there was 
a dose-dependent improvement in HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and obesity in mice 
that had been treated with L. plantarum TCCC11824 for 5 wk, thus restoring the 
balance of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, it showed that cell lysate of L. 
plantarum TCCC11824 could directly exhibit protective effects on the hepatocyte 
steatosis induced by oleic acid, and regulate the expression of HMGCR by 
inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, L.plantarum TCCC11824 ameliorated the 
expression of indicators of hyperlipidemia and inhibited the synthesis of SCFAs 
(short-chain fatty acids), as shown by blood and fecal tests in hyperlipidemic 
patients. In summary, L. plantarum TCCC11824 exerts anti-hyperlipidemic and 
anti-obesity effects through the regulation of HMGCR via NF-κB and modulating 
gut microbiota, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the 
treatment of hyperlipidemia and obesity.

The rhizospheres of plants and soil microorganisms are intricately 
interconnected. Tea trees are cultivated extensively on the karst plateau of 
Guizhou Province, China; however, the understanding of the interactions among 
fungal communities, community taxa, and diseases impacting tea tree in the soil 
rhizosphere is limited. Our aim is to offer insights for the advancement of 
modern agriculture in ecologically fragile karst tea gardens, as well as 
microbiomics concepts for green and sustainable environmental development. This 
study utilized the internal transcribed spacer high-throughput sequencing 
technology to explore the symbiotic relationship between rhizosphere fungi and 
plant disease feedback in multiple tea estates across the Guizhou Plateau. The 
ecological preferences and environmental thresholds of fungi were investigated 
via environmental variables. Furthermore, a correlation was established between 
different taxa and individual soil functions. Research has indicated that tea 
leaf blight disrupts symbiotic connections among fungal groups. For various 
taxa, we found that numerous taxa consistently maintained core positions within 
the community, whereas rare taxa were able to stabilize due to a high proportion 
of positive effects. Additionally, abundant taxa presented a wider range of 
environmental feedback, whereas the rare taxon diversity presented a stronger 
positive association with the soil Z score. This study contributes to our 
understanding of the importance of rare taxa in plant rhizosphere soil 
processes. Emphasis should be placed on the role of rare taxa in pest and 
disease control within green agriculture while also strengthening systematic 
development and biogeographical research related to rare taxa in this 
region.IMPORTANCEIn this study, based on internal transcribed spacer 
high-throughput sequencing, fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil of tea 
trees and their interactions with the environment in karst areas were reported, 
and the symbiotic relationships of different fungal taxa and their feedback to 
the environment were described in detail by using the knowledge of microbial 
ecology. On this basis, it was found that tea tree diseases affect the symbiotic 
relationships of fungal taxa. At the same time, we found that rare taxa have 
stronger cooperative relationships in response to environmental changes and 
explored their participation in soil processes based on fungal trait sets. This 
study will provide basic data for the development of modern agriculture in tea 
gardens and theoretical basis for the sustainable prevention and control of tea 
tree diseases.

Fecal matter is recognized as both a reservoir and a transmission source for 
various antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs). However, the transcriptional 
activity of AMRGs in swine feces is not well understood. In addition, the effect 
of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the excretion of AMRGs has rarely 
been reported. Our study explored the diversity, abundance, transcriptional 
activity, and bacterial hosts of AMRGs in Tibetan and Duroc pig feces using 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing technologies. We discovered a 
significantly higher genomic abundance of AMRGs in the feces of Duroc pigs 
compared to Tibetan pigs (P < 0.001), although the transcript levels did not 
show a significant difference. The results showed that the core composition of 
AMRGs in pig feces varied considerably, with the most transcriptionally active 
AMRGs being oqxB, tetQ, Bla1, dfrA1, and amrB. Furthermore, the Firmicutes 
phylum is the main host of AMRGs. By transplanting fecal flora from Tibetan and 
Duroc pigs into the intestines of Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets after 
acute antibiotic exposure, we found that only Tibetan pig fecal flora 
significantly reduced AMRGs in the feces of DLY piglets (P < 0.05). The 
effectiveness of Tibetan pig fecal microorganisms in removing AMRGs from DLY pig 
feces was mainly influenced by microbial communities, especially the 
Bacteroidota phylum. These findings offer valuable insights for the prevention 
and control of AMRG pollution.
IMPORTANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first 
comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance gene (AMRGs) expression in 
the fecal microbiota of Tibetan and Duroc pigs, employing an integrated 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach. Our findings indicate a higher risk 
of AMRGs transmission in the feces of Duroc pigs compared to Tibetan pigs. Given 
the escalating antimicrobial resistance crisis, novel therapeutic interventions 
are imperative to mitigate gut colonization by pathogens and AMRGs. In this 
regard, we investigated the impact of fecal microbiota from Tibetan and Duroc 
pig sources on AMRGs excretion in Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets' feces 
following acute antibiotic exposure. Remarkably, only fecal microbiota sourced 
from Tibetan pigs exhibited a reduction in AMRGs excretion in DLY piglets' 
feces. This underscores the significance of evaluating the presence of AMRGs 
within donor fecal microbiota for effective AMRGs decolonization strategies.

Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has long been recognized primarily as a 
hospital-acquired pathogen. However, recent studies have uncovered a potential 
link between this bacterium and oral cancer, necessitating a deeper exploration 
of this relationship. This review examines the relevance of A. baumannii 
biofilms in the context of oral cancer development. By synthesizing current 
knowledge, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of this emerging 
area of research and identify critical directions for future investigations. The 
review emphasizes the remarkable adaptability, environmental resilience, and 
antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii, delves into the molecular mechanisms of 
biofilm formation, and their potential connection to oral cancer progression. 
The review also evaluates how biofilm colonization on oral surfaces and medical 
devices, along with its role in chronic infections, inflammation, and increased 
antimicrobial resistance, could contribute to creating a microenvironment 
favourable for tumor development. This review underscores the broader healthcare 
implications of A. baumannii biofilms, evaluates current strategies for their 
prevention and eradication, and calls for interdisciplinary research in this 
emerging field. By shedding light on the complex interactions between A. 
baumannii biofilms and oral cancer, it aims to stimulate further research and 
guide the development of new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies 
in both microbiology and oncology.

PURPOSE: Nobiletin (NOB), an extract derived from citrus fruit peels, is 
renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the 
specific impact of NOB on alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and its regulatory 
pathways remains an underexplored area of study. This research aims not only to 
confirm the positive regulatory effects of NOB on ALD but also to explore its 
mechanism of action through the "gut-liver axis" theory.
METHODS: Utilizing the Lieber-DeCarli method, C57BL/6J male mice were subjected 
to a four-week liquid alcohol diet to induce ALD. The mechanism of NOB 
alleviating ALD is explored by detecting biochemical analysis, western blot, 
qRT-PCR, and gut microbiota analysis.
RESULTS: In vivo, it was observed that NOB treatment (2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) 
significantly alleviated alcohol-induced liver inflammation, accompanied by 
normalization of aberrant gene and protein expression patterns associated with 
inflammation. Notably, this treatment also enhanced intestinal barrier 
integrity, resulting in decreased intestinal LPS permeability and a subsequent 
reduction in ileum inflammation. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA analysis demonstrated 
that NOB effectively ameliorated alcohol-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by 
restoring the balance between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and promoting the 
growth of beneficial bacterial families like Akkermansiaceae. In vitro, 
utilizing LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, NOB's efficacy in mitigating liver 
inflammation was further corroborated. Specifically, the treatment was found to 
exert its anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of the NF-κB/TLR4 
signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: our study has made significant progress in understanding NOB's 
hepatoprotective effects on alcohol-induced ALD mice. This perspective not only 
clarifies NOB's therapeutic role in ALD management but also inspires future 
research on additional gut-liver axis indicators for a comprehensive exploration 
of NOB's therapeutic potential.

Early weaning is frequently accompanied by a significant increase in diarrhea 
and mortality rates, which reduces rabbits' performance. Although antibiotics 
can reduce pathogenic bacteria, they also harm beneficial microorganisms and 
disrupt the normal intestinal microbiota balance. In order to find non-residue 
and non-toxic alternatives to antibiotics to ensure the safety of animal 
products, we conducted a study on the effect of compound microecological 
preparations supplementation on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. A 
total of 60 female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: CON, 
supplemented with probiotics at 3, 6, and 9 g/female rabbit/day from day 24 of 
gestation until weaning. We observed that probiotics supplementation 
significantly enhanced production performance (P < 0.05), immune and antioxidant 
function (P < 0.05), as well as intestinal flora composition in lactating 
rabbits and their offspring. Notably, compared with the control group, the 
experimental group exhibited a 19.23%, 44.22%, and 24.57% increase in milk yield 
(P = 0.002). Regarding rabbit growth performance, the average body weight of 
young rabbits in the experimental group showed a significant increase of 3.59%, 
10.22%, and 6.74% at day 35 (P = 0.022), whereas the average daily gain (ADG) of 
rabbits aged between 21 and 35 days was significantly elevated by 4.94%, 17.06%, 
and 6.28% in the experimental group (P < 0.001). In conclusion, probiotics 
supplementation can significantly enhance lactation performance, promote growth 
and disease resistance in rabbits, as well as improve intestinal health when 
administered at a dosage of 6 g/day. Moreover, the limited sample size in this 
study may hinder the detection of subtle effects, and augmenting the sample size 
will bolster the reliability of the study findings.
IMPORTANCE: The intestinal environment of rabbits is fragile and susceptible to 
environmental influences, leading to inflammatory intestinal diseases. Adding 
antibiotics to rabbit feed can achieve the effect of preventing and treating 
inflammation, which can also lead to the imbalance of the gut microbiota and 
residual antibiotics in agricultural products. Composite probiotics are live 
microbial feed additives composed of various ratios of probiotics and have 
become the most promising alternative to antibiotics due to their residue-free 
and non-toxic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 
compound probiotics on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. Our 
findings highlight the potential of compound microecological preparations as an 
effective strategy for enhancing lactation performance, immune function, and 
antioxidant capacity in rabbits. The supplementation of probiotics through 
rabbit milk offers a promising approach to optimize the growth and health 
outcomes of newborn rabbits.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a global health problem with limited 
therapeutic options. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to this disorder are 
not yet fully understood, and in this respect, metabolomics represents a 
promising approach to decipher metabolic events related to AUD. The plasma 
metabolome contains a plethora of bioactive molecules that reflects the 
functional changes in host metabolism but also the impact of the gut microbiome 
and nutritional habits.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the impact of severe AUD (sAUD), and of 
a 3-week period of alcohol abstinence, on the blood metabolome (non-targeted 
LC-MS metabolomics analysis) in 96 sAUD patients hospitalized for alcohol 
withdrawal.
RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of different lipids 
((lyso)phosphatidylcholines, long-chain fatty acids), short-chain fatty acids 
(i.e. 3-hydroxyvaleric acid) and bile acids were altered in sAUD patients. In 
addition, several microbial metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid, 
p-cresol sulfate, hippuric acid, pyrocatechol sulfate, and metabolites belonging 
to xanthine class (paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline) were sensitive to 
alcohol exposure and alcohol withdrawal. 3-Hydroxyvaleric acid, caffeine 
metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) and microbial 
metabolites (hippuric acid and pyrocatechol sulfate) were correlated with 
anxiety, depression and alcohol craving. Metabolomics analysis in postmortem 
samples of frontal cortex and cerebrospinal fluid of those consuming a high 
level of alcohol revealed that those metabolites can be found also in brain 
tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data allow the identification of neuroactive metabolites, from 
interactions between food components and microbiota, which may represent new 
targets arising in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases such as sAUD.

Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, play a crucial role in 
manipulating the gut microbiome, with implications for human health and disease. 
Despite the vast amount of data available on the human gut virome, the number of 
cultured phages that infect human gut bacteria-particularly obligate 
anaerobes-remains strikingly limited. Here, we summarize the resources and basic 
characteristics of phages that infect the human gut obligate anaerobe. We review 
various methods for isolating these phages and suggest a strategy for their 
isolation. Additionally, we outline their impact on the field of viral biology, 
their interactions with bacteria and humans, and their potential for disease 
intervention. Finally, we discuss the value and prospects of research on these 
phages, providing a comprehensive 'Roadmap' that sheds light on the 'dark 
matter' of phages that infect human gut obligate anaerobes.

Evidence indicates that gut microbiota is crucial in ulcerative colitis (UC) 
development. Increased Peptostreptococcus species abundance is linked to UC, but 
its role and mechanisms in intestinal inflammation are not well understood. This 
study used a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice, and 
different bacterial strains were administered via gavage. We assessed clinical 
manifestations, colonic barrier function, gut microbiota composition, and levels 
of inflammatory cytokines, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 
(NLRP3) signaling molecules, and pyroptosis-related proteins. Mouse bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with Peptostreptococcus 
anaerobius at different time points and multiplicities of infection (MOI). Cell 
viability and the expression of NLRP3 signaling molecules and 
pyroptosis-associated proteins were assessed. The inhibitors C29, TAK-242, and 
MCC950 were employed for Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NLRP3 signaling pathways. 
It was observed that P. anaerobius exacerbated intestinal inflammation and 
barrier injury in DSS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, P. anaerobius 
contributed to gut microbiota dysbiosis during colitis progression. P. 
anaerobius induced the expression of NLRP3 signaling molecules and 
pyroptosis-associated proteins in mouse colitis tissues. In vitro assays 
demonstrated that P. anaerobius activated NLRP3 inflammasome and evoked 
gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion in 
macrophages. Furthermore, TLR2 and TLR4 were identified as key mediators of P. 
anaerobius-induced macrophage pyroptosis via activation of the Nuclear 
Factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-NLRP3 pathway. In conclusion, P. anaerobius promotes 
macrophage pyroptosis and IL-1β secretion through the TLR2/4-NF-κB-NLRP3 
signaling axis, thereby aggravating colitis. P. anaerobius may represent a 
potential risk factor for UC development.

OBJECTIVE: Over the past years, interest in the role of gut microbiota in 
neurodegenerative diseases has emerged. Despite numerous publications over the 
past decade, both in human and pre-clinical studies, there is no clear consensus 
on the microbiota's role or involvement in ALS. Few studies on mouse models of 
ALS highlighted a correlation between specific bacteria species and the 
prognostic or severity of the disease. Still these results lack reproducibility 
and remain controverted. In this article we present a study of fecal microbiota 
in the SOD1G93A mouse model associated with a metabolomic analysis of cecum 
content, compared to controls.
METHODS: Intestinal metabolomic profile and fecal microbiota were assessed in 
two cohorts of SODG93A mice compared to wildtype controls at the terminal stage 
of the ALS disease.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant difference in metabolomic profile in 
SOD1G93A mice compared to controls but without a marked change in composition 
and diversity of fecal microbiota. Nevertheless, we observed an increase of 
Lachnospiraceae family, which are butyrate-producer bacteria, in SOD1G93A mice. 
Moreover, some metabolites with significantly different intestinal 
concentrations are partially produced and linked with intestinal bacteria, such 
as riboflavin, hippurate, and N-acetylputrescine, leaving us convinced of the 
interest in looking further into the role of the microbiota in ALS.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite an alteration of the intestinal metabolome in SOD1G93A 
mice, microbiota data did not show significant changes, underlying the need for 
further research.

Non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more progressive form of non‑alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, has become a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. The 
aim of the present study was to investigate the anti‑NASH effect of the 
nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin and its specific molecular mechanisms. A 
methionine‑choline deficient (MCD) diet was used to induce NASH formation in 
mice. The mice with NASH were treated with rifaximin to observe its effects on 
liver fat deposition, hepatocyte inflammation and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, 
the intestinal microbiota of mice with NASH was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing 
and terminal ileal bile acid levels were assessed using liquid 
chromatography‑electrospray ionization‑tandem mass spectrometry analysis. 
Furthermore, the correlation between the intestinal microflora and bile acid 
levels in the terminal ileum was investigated, and the effects of rifaximin on 
the intestinal Helicobacter‑deoxycholic acid (DCA)‑farnesoid X receptor 
(Fxr)‑hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (Hnf1α) signalling pathway were examined. 
Moreover, analyses of mice after intestinal decontamination with broad‑spectrum 
antibiotics and of hepatocyte‑specific Hnf1α knockout (Hnf1αH‑KO) mice were used 
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which rifaximin improves NASH. Notably, 
treatment with rifaximin markedly ameliorated liver steatosis, hepatocyte 
inflammation and liver fibrosis in mice with MCD diet‑induced NASH. Rifaximin 
modulated the gut microbiota, especially Helicobacter hepaticus, in mice with 
NASH. In addition, rifaximin inhibited the intestinal Helicobacter‑DCA‑Fxr‑Hnf1α 
signalling pathway in mice with NASH. By contrast, rifaximin did not exert an 
anti‑NASH effect on decontamination‑treated mice or Hnf1αH‑KO mice. Taken 
together, these results indicated that rifaximin can ameliorate NASH in mice by 
modulating the Helicobacter‑DCA‑Fxr‑Hnf1α signalling pathway, providing a 
theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of patients with NASH with 
rifaximin.

Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have emerged as major global public 
health challenges, causing numerous infections and fatalities each year. 
However, current measures, including vaccines and treatments, are often limited 
or ineffective. This highlights the urgent need for novel preventive strategies 
to control the spread of key mosquito-borne viruses like DENV and ZIKV. In a 
recent study published in Science, Zhang et al. isolated a bacterium named 
Rosenbergiella_YN46 from the gut of field-caught Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in 
Yunnan Province, China. This commentary reviews their findings, published on 
April 19, 2024, which describe the symbiotic bacterium Rosenbergiella_YN46 and 
its ability to block flavivirus transmission, including both DENV and ZIKV. The 
bacterium shows promising potential for future dengue fever prevention and 
provides valuable insights into a novel biological approach for controlling 
mosquito-borne viral diseases.

Contemporary scientific discussions are increasingly focusing on Akkermansia 
muciniphila due to its complex influence on intestinal physiology. This article 
provides a comprehensive analysis of the various effects Akkermansia muciniphila 
has on intestinal inflammation, while also exploring its potential associations 
with obesity and cardiovascular diseases. A systematic literature search was 
conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate with the following 
keywords: Akkermansia muciniphila, obesity, cardiovascular risk, and 
inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of our mini-review was to examine the 
impact of Akkermansia bacteria on the intestines, cardiovascular system, and its 
relationship with obesity. Through a detailed review of current literature, the 
article seeks to elucidate the complex interactions of Akkermansia muciniphila 
within the human body, highlighting its potential contributions to health 
improvement and medical interventions. Research indicates that Akkermansia 
muciniphila positively correlates with maintaining intestinal health, modulating 
the cardiovascular system, and aiding in weight management. However, the number 
of studies available is small, and the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila on 
human health require further research.

BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis (PDRP) is one of the most 
common complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Understanding the risk factors 
and etiological characteristics is indispensable for infection prevention and 
improving the outcome and life quality.
METHODS: A total of 70 PD patients were separated into the PDRP group (n=25) and 
the control group (n=45). Variables, including gender, age, body mass index, 
primary diseases, and history of basic diseases, in the two groups were analyzed 
to assess the risk factors of PDRP. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing 
(mNGS) and microbial culture were compared in detecting pathogenic 
microorganisms. Gut microbiota analysis was performed in 35 PDRP patients based 
on mNGS data.
RESULTS: Dialysis time and times of dialysate change were the risk factors of 
PDRP, and times of dialysate change was the independent risk factor of PDRP (p = 
0.046). mNGS produced higher sensitivity (65.79%) than microbial culture 
(36.84%) in identifying pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (four cases) were the most frequent pathogens causing 
PDRP, followed by Staphylococcus capitis (three cases). β diversity of the gut 
microbiota was significantly different between patients with fewer times of 
dialysate change (≤4) and more (>5), as well as between patients with 
gram-positive (G+) bacterial and gram-negative (G-) bacterial infection.
CONCLUSION: The dialysis time and times of dialysate changes not only are risk 
factors for peritonitis in PD patients but also stimulate significant changes in 
the gut microbiome structure in PDRP patients. These findings may provide a 
novel viewpoint for the management of patients with PDRP.

INTRODUCTION: Disorders of acid-base balance in the rumen of dairy cows have a 
significant impact on their health and performance. However, the effect of 
transient differences in pH on susceptibility to subacute ruminal acidosis 
(SARA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis in dairy cows remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, milk, serum, and rumen fluid samples from 40 Holstein 
dairy cows (on d 56 postpartum) with different rumen pH (2-4 h after morning 
feeding) were explored to investigate the difference of susceptibility to SARA 
and the correlation between microbiome, LPS and inflammation. These cows were 
categorized into low pH (LPH, pH ≤ 6.0, n = 20) and high pH (HPH, pH ≥ 6.5, 
n = 20) groups.
RESULTS: The results showed that LPH group increased the concentrations of total 
volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate. However, milk 
yield and milk compositions were unaffected. Compared to the HPH group, the LPH 
group increased the concentrations of serum BHBA, NEFA, LPS, HIS, IL-2, IL-6, 
TNF-α, and MDA, and decreased the concentrations of serum IgA, IgM, IgG, SOD, 
T-AOC, and mTOR. In addition, the LPH group decreased the copies of Ruminococcus 
flavefaciens and increased the copies of Fibrobacter succinogenes. Microbial 
community analysis isupplendicated a significant difference in bacterial 
composition between the two groups. At the phylum level, Bacteroidota and 
Firmicutes were enriched in the LPH and HPH groups, respectively. At the genus 
level, the dominant bacteria in the LPH group were Prevotella. Additionally, the 
LPH group increased the proportions of Gram-negative phenotypes, potentially 
pathogenic phenotypes and LPS biosynthesis. The close correlation between two 
key enzymes for LPS synthesis LpxL and LpxM with rumen pH, inflammatory markers, 
and microorganisms indicates that low pH may increase the risk of inflammation 
by facilitating the lysis of Gram-negative bacteria and the release of 
penta-acylated LPS. Penta-acylated and hexa-acylated LPS may be mainly derived 
from Prevotella and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-001, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Overall, these results support the notion that transient low pH 
could reflect the risk of cows suffering from SARA and associated inflammation 
and is strongly associated with penta-acylated LPS. Our findings provide new 
insights into ruminant health improvement and disease prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been found to have benefits for 
diabetes mellitus (DM), but a bibliometric analysis of its association with DM 
has yet to be conducted. This paper aims to explore the current status and 
research hotspots on the connection between the Mediterranean diet and DM from 
2014 to 2024, providing a reference for future studies.
METHODS: We retrieved articles published between 2014 and 2024 from the Web of 
Science database and analyzed them using R software, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace.
RESULTS: A total of 2,806 articles were included in this study. Research on the 
relationship between the MedDiet and DM showed a steady increase in publication 
volume from 2014 to 2019, followed by a sharp rise from 2020 to 2023. Spain was 
the leading country in terms of publication volume, followed by Italy, the 
United States, China, and Greece. Spain also led in international 
collaborations, with CIBER-Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red and Harvard 
University being the most prominent collaboration centers. Nutrients was the 
most frequently published and cited journal in this field. Common keywords in 
this literature included components such as olive oil, legumes, and red wine. 
Mechanisms studied in this field primarily focused on antioxidant effects, 
improvements in insulin sensitivity and secretion, regulation of lipid 
metabolism, and modulation of gut microbiota.
CONCLUSION: Research on the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on DM patients has 
garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide, and it is expected to 
become a major focus for future DM prevention and treatment. This study provides 
a comprehensive analysis of the current status and research hotspots regarding 
the relationship between the MedDiet and DM, offering valuable references for 
future research.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations among post-coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) prevalence; risk factors and comorbidities have not been firmly 
established within a university outpatient population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records from 881 COVID-19 outpatient patients (504 females 
[57.9%] and 366 males [42.07%]), most of whom were between 30 and 40 years of 
age (mean=37.3 years old; 95% CI, 36.5-38.2), with initial infection data from 
February 2020 to August 2022 were reviewed once, whereas the survey took place 
during 2 different moments during the pandemic. The first period (April 20, 
2021, to June 21, 2021) yielded 279 responses, whereas in the second period 
(June 23, 2021, to October 4, 2021), 602 responses were recorded. The instrument 
used contained 20 questions across 3 main domains: general information, data 
related to infection and adverse effects, and service satisfaction experience.
RESULTS: All the patients were positive for immunoglobulin G antibodies against 
nucleocapsid by the third week. Post-COVID-19 symptoms arose at least 2 weeks 
after recovery from the initial illness; 654 individuals reported at least one 
symptom after the acute COVID-19 period, for a post-COVID-19 prevalence of 
74.96%. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (84%), headache (71%), and 
difficulty concentrating (71%). More than 60% of participants reported at least 
one comorbidity, among which the most common ones were obesity (35.9%), smoking 
(17.5%), and hypertension (12.2%).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we assessed post-COVID-19 prevalence among 
outpatients and found that comorbidities were strongly related to consequences 
impacting quality of life and mental health burden.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains a challenging condition both for patients 
and clinicians, characterized by its chronic nature and the elusive complexity 
of its underlying mechanisms. The multifaceted relationship between the 
neuroendocrine axis, gut microbiota, and inflammatory response has emerged as a 
focal point in recent research, offering new insights into the pathophysiology 
of IBS. The neuroendocrine axis plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate 
balance between the brain and the gut, often referred to as the "gut-brain 
axis". This bidirectional communication is essential for regulating 
gastrointestinal function, stress responses, and overall homeostasis. 
Dysregulation of this axis, as highlighted by elevated cortisol and serotonin 
levels in IBS patients, suggests that neuroendocrine imbalances may 
significantly contribute to the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. These 
findings underscore the need for a broader understanding of how stress and 
emotional factors influence IBS, potentially guiding more effective, 
personalized treatment approaches. Equally important is the role of the gut 
microbiota, a diverse and dynamic ecosystem that directly impacts gut health. 
This dysbiosis disrupts gut function and appears to exacerbate the 
neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. These findings align with the growing 
recognition that gut microbiota is a critical player in IBS, influencing both 
the disease's onset and progression.

Cholestatic liver disease (CLD) is a common liver disorder with limited 
treatment options. Here, we demonstrate that zinc (Zn) supplementation can alter 
the gut microbiome to mitigate cholestatic liver injury. Oral Zn altered the 
microbiota of mice and humans (this study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
[NCT05597137]), increasing the abundance of Blautia producta (B. producta) and 
promoting the generation of p-coumaric acid. Additionally, p-coumaric acid 
concentrations were negatively correlated with liver injury parameters in CLD 
patients. In mice, the protective effects of Zn were partially mediated by 
p-coumaric acid, which directly bound to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) and suppressed the production of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in hepatocytes, thus preventing hepatocyte cell death and 
liver damage. Additionally, knocking out the histidine ammonia-lyase, which 
catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-coumaric acid in B. producta, blunted 
the protective effects of Zn. These findings highlight a host-microbiota 
interaction that is stimulated by Zn supplementation, providing potential 
benefits for CLD.

The consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has surged globally, raising 
significant public health concerns due to their associations with a range of 
adverse health outcomes. This review aims to elucidate potential health impacts 
of UPF intake and underscore the importance of considering diet quality when 
interpreting study findings. UPF group, as classified by the Nova system based 
on the extent of industrial processing, contains numerous individual food items 
with a wide spectrum of nutrient profiles, as well as differential quality as 
reflected by their potential health effects. The quality of a given food may 
well misalign with the processing levels so that a UPF food can be nutritious 
and healthful whereas a non-UPF food can be of low quality and excess intake of 
which may lead to adverse health consequences. The current review argues that it 
is critical to focus on the nutritional content and quality of foods and their 
role within the overall dietary pattern rather than only the level of 
processing. Further research should dissect health effects of diet quality and 
food processing, investigate the health impacts of ingredients that render the 
UPF categorization, understand roles of metabolomics and the gut microbiome in 
mediating and modulating the health effects of food processing, and consider 
environmental sustainability in UPF studies. Emphasizing nutrient-dense 
healthful foods and dietary patterns shall remain the pivotal strategy for 
promoting overall health and preventing chronic diseases.

Alzheimer's disease not only affects the brain, but also induces metabolic 
dysfunction in peripheral organs and alters the gut microbiota. The aim of this 
study was to investigate systemic changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease, in 
particular the association between changes in peripheral organ metabolism, 
changes in gut microbial composition, and Alzheimer's disease development. To do 
this, we analyzed peripheral organ metabolism and the gut microbiota in amyloid 
precursor protein-presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic and control mice at 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 months of age. Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited cognitive 
impairment, Alzheimer's disease-related brain changes, distinctive metabolic 
disturbances in peripheral organs and fecal samples (as detected by untargeted 
metabolomics sequencing), and substantial changes in gut microbial composition 
compared with younger APP/PS1 mice. Notably, a strong correlation emerged 
between the gut microbiota and kidney metabolism in APP/PS1 mice. These findings 
suggest that alterations in peripheral organ metabolism and the gut microbiota 
are closely related to Alzheimer's disease development, indicating potential new 
directions for therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the microbial variations and 
biomarkers in the oral environment of patients with persistent pulmonary nodules 
(pPNs) and to reveal the potential biological functions of the salivary 
microbiota in pPNs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 483 participants (141 
healthy controls and 342 patients with pPNs) from June 2022 and January 2024. 
Saliva samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene to assess microbial diversity and differential abundance. Seven advanced 
machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, 
multi-layer perceptron, naïve Bayes, random forest, gradient boosting decision 
tree, and LightGBM) were utilized to evaluate performance and identify key 
microorganisms, with fivefold cross-validation employed to ensure robustness. 
The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to explain the 
contribution of these core microbiotas to the predictive model. Additionally, 
the PICRUSt2 algorithm was used to predict the microbial functions.
RESULTS: The salivary microbial composition in pPNs group showed significantly 
lower α- and β-diversity compared to healthy controls. A high-accuracy LightGBM 
model was developed, identifying six core genera-Fusobacterium, Solobacterium, 
Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Atopobium, and Peptostreptococcus-as pPNs 
biomarkers. Additionally, a visualization pPNs risk prediction system was 
developed. The immune responses and metabolic activities differences in salivary 
microbiota between the patients with pPNs and healthy controls were revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential clinical applications of the 
salivary microbiota for enable earlier detection and targeted interventions, 
offering significant promise for advancing clinical management and improving 
patient outcomes in pPNs.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), 
formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is becoming the most 
common chronic liver disease. The gut microbiome is regarded to play a crucial 
role in MAFLD, but the specific changes of gut microbiome, especially fungi, in 
different stages of MAFLD are not well understood. This study aimed to observe 
the longitudinal changes of colon bacteria and fungi of mice at different 
feeding duration of a high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFHFD), and explore the 
association between the changes and the progression of MAFLD.
METHODS: Twenty-eight male C57BL6J mice were randomly assigned to the normal 
diet (ND) group and HFHFD group. At the 8th and 16th weeks, mice were sacrificed 
to compare the diversity, composition, and co-abundance network of bacteria and 
fungi in colon contents among groups.
RESULTS: HFHFD-8W mice exhibited increases in Candida and Dorea, and decreases 
in Oscillospira and Prevotella in comparison to ND-8W mice, HFHFD-16W mice had 
increases in Bacteroides, Candida, Desulfovibrio, Dorea, Lactobacillus, and 
Rhodotorula, and decreases in Akkermansia, Aspergillus, Sterigmatomyces, and 
Vishniacozyma in comparison to ND-16W mice. And compared to HFHFD-8W mice, 
HFHFD-16W mice had increases in Desulfovibrio, Lactobacillus, Penicillium, and 
Rhodotorula, and decreases in Talaromyces and Wallemia. Spearman and GEE 
correlation analysis revealed that Bacteroides, Candida, Desulfovibrio, and 
Lactobacillus positively correlated with NAFLD activity score (NAS).
CONCLUSION: Gut microbiota and mycobiota undergo diverse changes at different 
stages of MAFLD.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD), the pathophysiology is still not fully understood. Recent 
evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play a role in the pathophysiology 
of NAFLD and may also offer new therapeutic options.
METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study included 100 consecutive newly 
diagnosed obese patients (BMI ≥ 95th percentile), aged 14-18 years with NAFLD 
(confirmed by ultrasound), persistently elevated levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 60 U/L for 1-6 months, and 100 healthy 
controls. We evaluated changes in the gut microbiota in NAFLD adolescents 
compared with healthy controls.
RESULTS: According to the multiple logistic regressions, the variables 
associated with NAFLD were the presence of Clostridium difficile, the presence 
of Salmonella spp., a greater abundance of Bifidobacterium and Prevotella, and a 
lower abundance of Lactobacillus.
CONCLUSION: Changes in the gut microbiota occur in adolescents with NAFLD 
compared with healthy individuals, which may be useful for identifying youths 
who are amenable to gut microbiota-based interventions.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol drinking and gut microbiota are related to hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), but the specific relationship between them remains unclear.
AIMS: We aimed to establish the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis and 
develop machine learning (ML) models in predicting the occurrence of early-stage 
HCC.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients with early-stage HCC and 278 controls 
were recruited. Alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis was established 
through the mediation/moderation effect analyses. Eight ML algorithms including 
Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 160 pairs of individuals were included for analyses. The 
mediation effects of Genus_Catenibacterium (P = 0.024), Genus_Tyzzerella_4 
(P < 0.001), and Species_Tyzzerella_4 (P = 0.020) were discovered. The 
moderation effects of Family_Enterococcaceae (OR = 0.741, 95%CI:0.160-0.760, 
P = 0.017), Family_Leuconostocaceae (OR = 0.793, 95%CI:0.486-3.593, P = 0.010), 
Genus_Enterococcus (OR = 0.744, 95%CI:0.161-0.753, P = 0.017), 
Genus_Erysipelatoclostridium (OR = 0.693, 95%CI:0.062-0.672, P = 0.032), 
Genus_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.655, 95%CI:0.098-0.749, P = 0.011), 
Species_Enterococcus_faecium (OR = 0.692, 95%CI:0.061-0.673, P = 0.013), and 
Species_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.653, 95%CI:0.086-0.765, P = 0.014) were uncovered. 
The predictive power of eight ML models was satisfactory (AUCs:0.855-0.932). The 
XGBoost model had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.932).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models based on the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis 
are valuable in predicting the occurrence of early-stage HCC.

Sulfate- and sulfite-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a group of strict anaerobes 
found within the human gut. Bilophila wadsworthia, a sulfite-reducing bacterium 
which produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from taurine and isethionate respiration, 
is a common member of the healthy commensal human gut microbiota but has been 
implicated in several disease states including inflammatory bowel disease and 
colorectal cancer. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, one of the most prominent gut 
bacteria, has sulfatases which release sulfate, serving as a potential substrate 
for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Here, we showed that when B. thetaiotaomicron and 
B. wadsworthia were in co-culture, there was a significant increase in B. 
thetaiotaomicron's growth and in H2S production by B. wadsworthia. Differential 
gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of B. wadsworthia's 
dsrMKJOP complex in co-culture, which delivers electrons for sulfite reduction 
to H2S. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of genes associated with 
taurine, sulfolactate, and thiosulfate respiration, indicating that B. 
thetaiotaomicron may provide an alternative source of sulfite to B. wadsworthia. 
We hypothesized adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to be this intermediate. 
Indeed, B. wadsworthia was able to grow using APS or sulfite as electron 
acceptors. Endometabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed decreased 
production of indole by B. thetaiotaomicron in co-culture with B. wadsworthia 
due to enhanced tryptophan utilization by B. wadsworthia. The results of this 
microbe-microbe interaction could have significant pro-inflammatory effects in 
the human gut environment.

Intestinal dysbiosis and the associated l-tryptophan metabolic disorder are 
pivotal in inflammatory bowel disease progression, leading to a compromised 
intestinal barrier integrity. Remedying the dysfunction in tryptophan metabolism 
has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Herein, we reprogram the 
tryptophan metabolism in situ by EcN-TRP@A/G, encapsulating the engineered 
probiotic, EcN-TRP, with enhanced tryptophan synthesis capacity, for sustained 
modulation, thereby restoring intestinal barrier function and microbial 
homeostasis. The pH-responsive dual-layered EcN-TRP@A/G microcapsule developed 
via high-voltage electrospraying and liquid interface self-assembly, preserved 
probiotic viability in the harsh gastrointestinal milieu, and facilitated 
targeted colon release. Bioluminescent tracking in mice reveals a 22.84-fold 
increase in EcN-TRP@A/G viability and distribution compared to naked EcN-TRP. 
Targeted metabolomics highlights EcN-TRP@A/G's modulation of the 
tryptophan-indole pathway. Oral administration of EcN-TRP@A/G sustained elevates 
indole metabolites, particularly indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic 
acid, in colon tissue for up to 7 days. In IBD mice, EcN-TRP@A/G improves 
intestinal permeability, reduces inflammation, and recovers the gut microbiome 
by enhancing beneficial bacteria abundance like Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and 
Anaerostipes while suppressing pathogenic strains like Escherichia-Shigella. Our 
findings offer a cost-effective approach, harnessing the probiotic metabolic 
potential in situ through engineered modifications for effective IBD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability among older 
people aged 60 years and above, with majority eventually being diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological agents approved for dementia include 
acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) inhibitors like rivastigmine, donepezil and 
galantamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine, 
prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with each other, depending on the 
severity of disease. There is currently no available study demonstrating the 
clinical response to these drugs for AD in the Filipino population. Hence, this 
protocol aims to characterise the clinical, genetic, microbial and metabolic 
factors associated with drug responses to donepezil, rivastigmine and/or 
memantine for AD in a cohort of Filipinos with late-onset AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol involves a multisite descriptive study that 
will use two study designs: (1) a descriptive, cross-sectional study to 
characterise the clinical profile of Filipino dementia patients with AD and (2) 
an exploratory prospective cohort study to investigate drug response-related 
genetic, gut microbiome and metabolome signatures of a subset of the recruited 
AD patients. At least 153 patients with mild or moderate AD aged 65 years old 
and above will be recruited regardless of their treatment status. A subset of 
these patients (n=60) who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included 
further in the exploratory cohort study. These patients will be grouped 
according to their baseline medications and will be observed for treatment 
response in 6 months. The cognitive, functional and behavioural domains of 
patients and levels of functioning will be measured using different assessment 
tools. Drug responses of Filipino patients will then be investigated employing 
multi-omics technology to characterise genetic variations via whole exome 
sequencing, gut microbiome profile via shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 
metabolome profile via liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical clearance from the 
Department of Health Single Joint Research Ethics Board (SJREB-2022-15). Results 
of psychometric scales will be made available to enrolled patients. The study 
results will be presented at national/international conferences and published in 
international peer-reviewed scientific journals, and summaries of the results 
will be provided to the study funders and institutional review boards of the 
three tertiary referral hospitals.

Diversion colitis is a common phenomenon affecting patients after defunctioning 
ileostomy. We present a complex case of diversion colitis where the patient was 
deemed unsuitable for restorative surgery due to multiple areas of stricturing 
in a long defunctioned colonic segment. Despite initial treatments with rectally 
administered topical mesalazine, butyrate enemas and topical steroid therapy, 
the patient remained symptomatic with rectal bleeding and mucus discharge. 
Furthermore, the appearance of colitis could be appreciated on endoscopy and 
radiological investigations with changes in histology consistent with 
moderate-severe diversion colitis. This article describes our experience in the 
use of autologous faecal transplant administered via the efferent loop of a 
double-barrel ileostomy to successfully treat diversion colitis refractory to 
standard topical therapy.

IMPORTANCE: The composition of the gut microbiota is essential for a dog's 
health and its adaptation to the environment. Different bacteria can produce the 
same essential metabolites beneficial to health owing to bacterial functional 
redundancy in microbial communities.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the gut bacterial communities of dogs from 
different breeds, all kept under identical domestication conditions.
METHODS: Noninvasive sampling and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing were used 
to compare the composition and function of the gut microbiota of three dog 
breeds: the Chinese Kunming dog (CKD), German Shepherd dog (GSD), and Belgian 
Malinois dog (BMD).
RESULTS: The gut microbiota of the three dog breeds consisted of 257 species 
across 146 genera, 60 families, 35 orders, 15 classes, and 10 phyla. The 
dominant bacterial phyla across the three breeds were Firmicutes (57.44%), 
Fusobacteriota (28.86%), and Bacteroidota (7.63%), while the dominant bacterial 
genera across the three breeds were Peptostreptococcus (21.08%), Fusobacterium 
(18.50%), Lactobacillus (12.37%), and Cetobacter (10.29%). Further analysis 
revealed significant differences in the intestinal flora of the three breeds at 
the phylum and genus levels. The intestinal flora of BMD was significantly 
richer than that of CKD and GSD. The functional prediction and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the primary functions of 
the gut microbiota in these breeds were similar, with significant enrichment in 
various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, 
secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and microbial metabolism in different 
environments. The intestinal flora of these breeds also played a crucial role in 
genetic information processing, including transcription, translation, 
replication, and material transport.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results provide novel insights into the 
intestinal flora of intervention dogs and suggest novel methods to improve their 
health status, which help increase microbial diversity and normalize metabolite 
production in diseased dogs.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
synovial inflammation, bone and cartilage damage, musculoskeletal pain, 
swelling, and stiffness. Inflammation is one of the key factors that induce RA. 
Jingfang Granule (JFG) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with significant 
anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical studies have confirmed that JFG can be used 
to treat RA, but the mechanism is still vague.
PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the protective function and the 
mechanism of JFG on rats with RA.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) was used to establish 
a rat RA model, and JFG or Diclofenac Sodium (Dic) was orally administered. Foot 
swelling and hematoxylin eosin (H&E) staining were used to test the therapeutic 
effect of JFG on RA treatment, while ELISA kits were used to detect serum 
cytokines. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), 
catalase (CAT), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were used to evaluate 
oxidative stress levels. The integration of label-free proteomics, fecal short 
chain fatty acid (SCFA) targeted metabolomics, peripheral blood SCFA, medium and 
long chain fatty acid targeted metabolomics, and 16S rDNA sequencing of gut 
microbiota were used to screen the mechanism. Western blot technology was used 
to validate the results of multiple omics studies. Serum D-Lactic acid, 
lipopolysaccharide specific IgA antibody (LPS IgA), diamine oxidase (DAO), and 
colon Claudin 5 and ZO-1 were used to evaluate the intestinal barrier.
RESULTS: The results confirmed that JFG effectively protected rats from RA 
injury, which was confirmed by improved foot swelling and synovial pathology. At 
the same time, JFG reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in serum by 
inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway and TLR4/NF-κB signaling 
pathway in synovial tissue. Multiple omics studies indicated that JFG increased 
the abundance of gut microbiota and regulated the number of gut bacteria, 
thereby increased the levels of Acetic acid, Propionic acid, and Butyric acid in 
the gut and serum of RA rats, which activated AMPK to regulate fatty acid 
metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis, thereby inhibited lipid oxidative stress 
induced ferroptosis to improve tissue damage caused by RA. Meanwhile, JFG 
improved the intestinal barrier by upregulating the expresses of Claudin 5 and 
ZO-1, which was confirmed by low concentrations of D-Lactic acid, LPS-SIgA and 
DAO in serum.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that JFG improved the disturbance of fatty 
acid metabolism by modulating gut microbiota and the production of fecal SCFAs 
to activate AMPK, and then inhibited ferroptosis caused by lipid oxidative 
stress in synovium tissue and prevented AR injury. This study proposes for the 
first time to investigate the mechanism of JFG treatment for RA from the 
perspective of the "Gut-joint" axis, and provides a promising approach for the 
treatment of RA.
