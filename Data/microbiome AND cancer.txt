BACKGROUND: Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pan-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 
inhibitor, ameliorates multiple pathological conditions and tissue injury and 
shows strong potential for clinical applications. Here, we investigated the 
preventive effects of DCA in a murine model of alcohol-associated liver disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the acute-on-chronic model of 
alcohol-associated liver disease and treated with DCA. Livers were assessed in 
liver histology, biochemistry, and gene expression. Mass spectrometry was used 
to compare protein expression and metabolite levels.
RESULTS: DCA inhibited hepatic expression of inflammatory genes but did not 
prevent steatosis and hepatocellular injury in ethanol-fed mice. Consistently, 
DCA repressed the expression of mRNAs for inflammatory genes in LPS-stimulated 
murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human monocytic THP-1 cells and 
inhibited both gene expression and protein release of interleukin-1 beta. DCA 
prevented hepatic accumulation of isovaleric acid in ethanol-fed mice, a 
short-chain fatty acid primarily produced by gut microbiota. In vitro, 
isovaleric acid potentiated LPS's effects, while DCA prevented this 
proinflammatory action. Ethanol feeding increased the expression of proteins 
involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including branched-chain amino acid 
(BCAA) degradation. In ethanol-fed mice, hepatic Fischer's ratio (the molar 
ratio of BCAAs to aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr) and BTR (the molar ratio of 
BCAAs to Tyr) showed a decrease compared to pair-fed mice; however, this 
decrease was not observed in DCA-treated ethanol-fed mice. DCA blunted the 
ethanol-induced increase of BCKDHA, the rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism, 
and cytochrome P450 2E1.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol-induced hepatic inflammatory responses and metabolic 
disturbances were prevented by DCA in mice, indicating the potential to develop 
pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors as an effective therapy to treat 
alcohol-associated liver disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to review the recent literature assessing 
the relationship between obesity and colorectal carcinogenesis, the effect of 
obesity on the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), tools available to help 
augment the increased risk, and outcomes for patients who are affected by both 
obesity and colorectal cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: The biochemical mechanisms contributing to CRC carcinogenesis 
are not well understood but are suspected to be related to adipose tissue 
leading to a pro-inflammatory state and changes in the gut microbiome. 
Individuals with obesity are at higher risk for CRC development, worse oncologic 
outcomes, and increased rates of post-operative complications. Bariatric surgery 
decreases CRC risk but results with GLP-1 agonists are heterogeneous. 
Prehabilitation is the only weight loss method that has been demonstrated to 
decrease risks of post-operative morbidity in this population. Obesity augments 
CRC risk and outcomes. There are persistent knowledge gaps in etiology and 
epidemiology for the increased CRC risk in obese patients and more research is 
required to identify the therapeutic advantage of weight loss on CRC risk.

Because large brains are energetically expensive, they are associated with 
metabolic traits that facilitate energy availability across vertebrates. 
However, the biological underpinnings driving these traits are not known. Given 
its role in regulating host metabolism in disease studies, we hypothesized that 
the gut microbiome contributes to variation in normal cross-vertebrate species 
differences in metabolism, including those associated with the brain's energetic 
requirements. By inoculating germ-free mice with the gut microbiota (GM) of 
three primate species - two with relatively larger brains and one with a smaller 
brain - we demonstrated that the GM of larger-brained primates shifts host 
metabolism towards energy use and production, while that of smaller-brained 
primates stimulates energy storage in adipose tissues. Our findings establish a 
causal role of the GM in normal cross-host species differences in metabolism 
associated with relative brain size and suggest that the GM may have been an 
important facilitator of metabolic changes during human evolution that supported 
encephalization.

Leukemia poses significant challenges to its treatment, and understanding its 
complex pathogenesis is crucial. This study used metagenomic sequencing to 
investigate the interplay between chemotherapy, gut microbiota, and antibiotic 
resistance in patients with acute leukemia (AL). Pre- and post-chemotherapy 
stool samples from patients revealed alterations in microbial richness, taxa, 
and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The analysis revealed a decreased alpha 
diversity, increased dispersion in post-chemotherapy samples, and changes in the 
abundance of specific bacteria. Key bacteria such as Enterococcus, Klebsiella, 
and Escherichia coli have been identified as prevalent ARG carriers. Correlation 
analysis between gut microbiota and blood indicators revealed potential links 
between microbial species and inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and adenosine deaminase (ADA). This study investigated the impact 
of antibiotic dosage on microbiota and ARGs, revealing networks connecting 
co-occurring ARGs with microbial species (179 nodes, 206 edges), and networks 
associated with ARGs and antibiotic dosages (50 nodes, 50 edges). Antibiotics 
such as cephamycin and sulfonamide led to multidrug-resistant Klebsiella 
colonization. Our analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles with Salmonella 
enterica elevated post-chemotherapy in NF patients and Akkermansia muciniphila 
elevated pre-chemotherapy. These microbial signatures could inform strategies to 
modulate the gut microbiome, potentially mitigating the risk of neutropenic 
fever in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of 
KEGG modules shed light on disrupted metabolic pathways after chemotherapy, 
providing insights into potential targets for managing side effects. Overall, 
this study revealed intricate relationships between gut microbiota, 
chemotherapy, and antibiotic resistance, providing new insights into improving 
therapy and enhancing patient outcomes.

This study investigated the effects of fermented food consumption on the risk of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) related to processed meat intake using a mouse model. 
Processed meat products and fermented foods were supplemented to analyze 
heterocyclic amines (HCA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and the gut 
microbiota in mice. The study determined age to be a non-influential factor. 
While HCAs were detected in all the processed meat samples, no CRC development 
was observed, even when they consumed excessive amounts of these processed 
meats, either alone or in combination with fermented foods. Bacteroides and 
Alistipes were the most predominant gut microbiota. Kimchi, soybean paste, and 
red pepper paste showed a decreasing trend in the ratio of these bacteria 
associated with gut inflammation, but the results were inconclusive because this 
trend was inconsistent. Therefore, this study found that fermented foods did not 
significantly affect CRC risk indicators associated with dietary processed meat 
intake, regardless of age.

Zizhong Dongjian (ZZDJ) is one of the most famous and popular fermented 
vegetables in China. The aim of this study was to explore the microbial 
communities and volatile flavor compounds of ZZDJ during different fermentation 
periods, as well as to reveal the potential correlation between microbiota and 
flavor. A total of 84 volatile flavor compounds were detected in 0-year to 
3-year ZZDJ samples. Hydrocarbons were the most abundant flavor compounds in 
0-year and 1-year samples, while esters became the predominant flavor components 
in 2-year and 3-year samples. Furthermore, Loigolactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and 
Virgibacillus were most predominant bacteria during the fermentation process of 
ZZDJ. Interestingly, all the fungi identified were yeasts. Among them, 
Zygosaccharomyces and Symmetrospora dominated alternatively throughout the 
fermentation process of ZZDJ. Through analysis of relativity between flavor 
compounds and microorganism of ZZDJ, we found that Uncultured Pseudomonas sp., 
Virgibacillus sediminis, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, and Symmetrospora marina 
might play important roles in flavor information of ZZDJ.

Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is prevalent among patients with 
colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to explore the anticancer roles of the 
fecal microbiota in inhibiting the progression of colorectal cancer and possible 
mechanisms. The intestinal microbial dysbiosis in CRC mice was significantly 
ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as indicated by the 
restored ACE index and Shannon index. The diameter and number of cancerous foci 
were significantly decreased in CRC mice treated with FMT, along with the 
restoration of the intestinal mucosal structure and the lessening of the gland 
arrangement disorder. Key factors in oxidative stress (TXN1, TXNRD1, and 
HIF-1α); cell cycle regulators (IGF-1, BIRC5, CDK8, HDAC2, EGFR, and CTSL); and 
a critical transcription factor of the innate immune signal pathway (IRF5) were 
among the repressed oncogenic targets engaged in the FMT treatment of CRC. 
Correlation analysis revealed that their expressions were positively correlated 
with uncultured_bacterium_o_Mollicutes_RF39, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and 
negatively correlated with Bacillus, Marvinbryantia, Roseburia, Angelakisella, 
Enterorhabdus, Bacteroides, Muribaculum, and genera of

INTRODUCTION: Repeated measures microbiome studies, including longitudinal and 
clustered designs, offer valuable insights into the dynamics of microbial 
communities and their associations with various health outcomes. However, 
visualizing such multivariate data poses significant challenges, particularly in 
distinguishing meaningful biological patterns from noise introduced by 
covariates and the complexities of repeated measures.
METHODS: In this study, we propose a framework to enhance the visualization of 
repeated measures microbiome data using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) 
adjusted for covariates through linear mixed models (LMM). Our method adjusts 
for confounding variables and accounts for the repeated measures structure of 
the data, enabling clearer identification of microbial community variations 
across time points or clusters.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of our approach through simulated scenarios 
and real datasets, showing that it effectively mitigates the influence of 
nuisance covariates and highlights key axes of microbiome variation.
DISCUSSION: This refined visualization technique provides a robust tool for 
researchers to explore and understand microbial community dynamics in repeated 
measures microbiome studies.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is 
a growing health concern and the risk of its development is connected with the 
increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which occurs as a result of 
some complex obesity-induced metabolic changes. It is a common chronic liver 
disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, the tendency 
to progress to more severe forms, and a corresponding increase in morbidity and 
mortality. Thus, effectively addressing the rising burden of the disease 
requires a thorough understanding of its complex interrelationship with obesity 
and MetS.
MAIN BODY: MASLD results from complex interactions involving obesity, insulin 
resistance, and dyslipidaemia, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, and is 
influenced by several genetic and environmental factors such as diet and gut 
microbiota dysbiosis. It has extensive metabolic and non-metabolic implications, 
including links to MetS components like hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and 
dyslipidaemia, and progresses to significant liver damage and other 
extra-hepatic risks like cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Diagnosis 
often relies on imaging and histology, with non-invasive methods preferred over 
liver biopsies. Emerging biomarkers and OMIC technologies offer improved 
diagnostic capabilities but face practical challenges. Advancements in 
artificial intelligence (AI), lifestyle interventions, and pharmacological 
treatments show promise, with future efforts focusing on precision medicine and 
novel diagnostic tools to improve patient outcome.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development 
of MASLD within the context of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is essential for 
identifying potential therapeutic targets. Advancements in non-invasive 
diagnostic tools and novel pharmacological treatments, hold promise for 
improving the management of MASLD. Future research should focus on precision 
medicine and innovative therapies to effectively address the disease and its 
consequences.

The human gut microbiome is a dynamic and intricate ecosystem, composed of 
trillions of microorganisms that play a pivotal role in maintaining overall 
health and well-being. However, the gut microbiome is constantly exposed to 
various environmental factors, including the bile produced by the liver, which 
can significantly impact its composition and function. Bile acids, secreted by 
the liver and stored in the gallbladder, modulate the gut microbiome, 
influencing its composition and function. This altered microbiome profile can, 
in turn, impact the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting an immunosuppressive 
environment that favors tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, changes in the 
gut microbiome can also influence the production of bile acids and other 
metabolites that directly affect cancer cells and their behavior. Moreover, bile 
acids have been shown to shape the microbiome and increase antibiotic 
resistance, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate relationships between bile, 
the gut microbiome, and the TME, highlighting the mechanisms by which this 
interplay drives cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Understanding 
these complex interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic 
strategies that target the gut-bile-TME axis and improve patient outcomes.

Microbiome modulation is one of the novel strategies in medicine with the 
greatest future to improve the health of individuals and reduce the risk of 
different conditions, including metabolic, immune, inflammatory, and 
degenerative diseases, as well as cancer. Regarding the latter, many studies 
have reported the role of the gut microbiome in carcinogenesis, formation and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as its response to different 
systemic therapies. Likewise, obesity, one of the most important risk factors 
for CRC, is also well known for its association with gut dysbiosis. Moreover, 
obesity and CRC display, apart from microbial dysbiosis, chronic inflammation, 
which participates in their pathogenesis. Although human and murine studies 
demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in regulating energy 
metabolism and CRC development, little is understood about the contribution of 
the microbiome to the development of obesity-associated CRC. Therefore, this 
systematic review explores the evidence for microbiome changes associated with 
these conditions and hypothesizes that this may contribute to the pathogenesis 
of obesity-related CRC. Two databases were searched, and different studies on 
the relationship among obesity, intestinal microbiota and CRC in clinical and 
preclinical models were selected. Data extraction was carried out by two 
reviewers independently, and 101 studies were finally considered. Findings 
indicate the existence of a risk association between obesity and CRC derived 
from metabolic, immune, and microbial disorders.

Fermented fruit drinks (FFDs) are gaining popularity among consumers for their 
unique flavors and potential health benefits. This review provides a systematic 
assessment of the flavor components in FFDs and explores the metabolic pathways 
for their formation. We examine the interactions between the structure of 
microbial communities and the development of these flavor components, 
highlighting the role of microorganisms in shaping the unique taste of FFDs. 
Additionally, we discuss the potential health benefits associated with FFDs, 
focusing on their relationship with microbial communities as supported by 
existing literature. The review also addresses future prospects and challenges 
in the field. Our findings indicate key fermenting microorganisms, such as 
lactic acid bacteria, yeast and acetic acid bacteria, are responsible for 
producing the distinctive flavor components in FFDs, including alcohols, 
ketones, aldehydes, esters, and fatty acids. These microorganisms also generate 
organic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, contributing to the drink's 
complex taste. Furthermore, this fermentation process enhances the bioactivity 
of FFDs, offering potential health benefits like antioxidant, anti-obesity, 
anti-diabetic, and anti-cancer properties. These insights are crucial for 
advancing fermentation technology and developing guidelines for producing 
nutrient-rich, flavorful FFDs.

Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has long been recognized primarily as a 
hospital-acquired pathogen. However, recent studies have uncovered a potential 
link between this bacterium and oral cancer, necessitating a deeper exploration 
of this relationship. This review examines the relevance of A. baumannii 
biofilms in the context of oral cancer development. By synthesizing current 
knowledge, we seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of this emerging 
area of research and identify critical directions for future investigations. The 
review emphasizes the remarkable adaptability, environmental resilience, and 
antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii, delves into the molecular mechanisms of 
biofilm formation, and their potential connection to oral cancer progression. 
The review also evaluates how biofilm colonization on oral surfaces and medical 
devices, along with its role in chronic infections, inflammation, and increased 
antimicrobial resistance, could contribute to creating a microenvironment 
favourable for tumor development. This review underscores the broader healthcare 
implications of A. baumannii biofilms, evaluates current strategies for their 
prevention and eradication, and calls for interdisciplinary research in this 
emerging field. By shedding light on the complex interactions between A. 
baumannii biofilms and oral cancer, it aims to stimulate further research and 
guide the development of new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies 
in both microbiology and oncology.

Amplification of human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) and 
overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) are 
key determinants in the treatment planning for human breast cancer (BC). 
Currently, targeted therapies for BC are focused mainly on these biomarkers. 
However, development of resistance to targeted drugs is almost unavoidable, 
emphasizing the importance of biochemical and pharmaceutical advances to improve 
treatment outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first 
to show functional crosstalk in vitro between HER2 and epithelial membrane 
protein 3 (EMP3), a tetraspan membrane protein, in human BC. EMP3 overexpression 
significantly promoted BC cell proliferation, invasion and migration by 
Transwell assays via epithelial-mesenchymal transition and transactivated the 
HER family, resulting in increased ER and PR expression in vitro. Knocking down 
EMP3 notably suppressed cell proliferation and migration and was accompanied by 
decreased expression of HER1‑HER3 and p‑SRC proteins. Suppression of EMP3 
expression enhanced sensitivity of BC cells to trastuzumab in vitro. Xenograft 
experiments revealed decreased expression of HER1 and HER2 in stable 
EMP3‑knockdown cells, resulting in decreased tumor weight and size. In patients 
with BC, EMP3 overexpression was detected in 72 of 166 cases (43.4%), with 18 of 
43 (41.9%) HER2‑amplified BC samples co‑expressing EMP3. Co‑expression of EMP3 
and HER2 was positively associated with ER expression (P=0.028) and tended to be 
associated with nodal metastasis (P=0.085), however this was not significant. 
Taken together, the present results supported the potential of targeting EMP3 as 
a novel therapeutic strategy for human BC via co‑expression of HER2 and EMP3.

Non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more progressive form of non‑alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, has become a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. The 
aim of the present study was to investigate the anti‑NASH effect of the 
nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin and its specific molecular mechanisms. A 
methionine‑choline deficient (MCD) diet was used to induce NASH formation in 
mice. The mice with NASH were treated with rifaximin to observe its effects on 
liver fat deposition, hepatocyte inflammation and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, 
the intestinal microbiota of mice with NASH was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing 
and terminal ileal bile acid levels were assessed using liquid 
chromatography‑electrospray ionization‑tandem mass spectrometry analysis. 
Furthermore, the correlation between the intestinal microflora and bile acid 
levels in the terminal ileum was investigated, and the effects of rifaximin on 
the intestinal Helicobacter‑deoxycholic acid (DCA)‑farnesoid X receptor 
(Fxr)‑hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (Hnf1α) signalling pathway were examined. 
Moreover, analyses of mice after intestinal decontamination with broad‑spectrum 
antibiotics and of hepatocyte‑specific Hnf1α knockout (Hnf1αH‑KO) mice were used 
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which rifaximin improves NASH. Notably, 
treatment with rifaximin markedly ameliorated liver steatosis, hepatocyte 
inflammation and liver fibrosis in mice with MCD diet‑induced NASH. Rifaximin 
modulated the gut microbiota, especially Helicobacter hepaticus, in mice with 
NASH. In addition, rifaximin inhibited the intestinal Helicobacter‑DCA‑Fxr‑Hnf1α 
signalling pathway in mice with NASH. By contrast, rifaximin did not exert an 
anti‑NASH effect on decontamination‑treated mice or Hnf1αH‑KO mice. Taken 
together, these results indicated that rifaximin can ameliorate NASH in mice by 
modulating the Helicobacter‑DCA‑Fxr‑Hnf1α signalling pathway, providing a 
theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of patients with NASH with 
rifaximin.

Infection is among the most common causes of death in patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) after chemotherapy. The anti-tumor effect of the 
intestinal microbiota in patients with AML is increasingly being recognized. 
Tigecycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotics, plays a vital role in the 
anti-infection treatment of AML patients with neutropenia and accompanying 
infections. Previously, this group reported that long-term use of tigecycline 
caused coagulation dysfunction in patients with hematological malignancies, 
increasing the risk of casualties. RNA sequencing was performed on CHO cells 
before and after tigecycline treatment. Further, the combined analysis of AML 
prognostic differentially expressed genes revealed 13 genes affected by 
tigecycline and closely related to AML prognosis. These genes were used for 
modeling analysis, and the results showed that the prepared model significantly 
improved the prognostic prediction efficiency for AML patients. The model also 
explored the correlation between prognosis score and immune cells infiltrating 
tumors and immune therapy targets. Moreover, 16S sequencing was performed on 
fecal samples from AML patients before and after tigecycline treatment. The 
results revealed that tigecycline significantly altered the distribution of 
intestinal microbiota in AML patients - These changes in microbiota are related 
to chemotherapy resistance. This study emphasizes the importance of intestinal 
microbiota in AML prognosis. Thus, the findings of this study show that the 
long-term use of antibiotics can not only cause dysbiosis of the intestinal 
microbiota but also indirectly affect the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs, 
affecting the prognosis of AML patients.

BACKGROUND: Whole-plant corn silage (WPCS) is an important roughage source for 
livestock, and have critical influences on rumen or intestinal microbiota, thus 
affecting the growth performance and feed efficiency. Our previous studies 
showed that adding WPCS to the diet of Hezuo pigs could promote the growth and 
fiber digestibility. While the aim of this study is to understand the effect of 
dietary WPCS on the colonic microflora in Hezuo pigs, which is essential for 
improving the roughage exploitation of pigs.
METHODS: Thirty-two Hezuo pigs with similar body weight (7.88 ± 0.81) kg were 
selected and randomly divided into four groups with eight pigs in each group. 
Pigs in the control group were fed a basal diet, pigs in the experimental groups 
(Groups I, II, and III) were fed basal diet supplemented with 5%, 10%, and 15% 
WPCS, respectively, under 120 d experimental period. Six pigs from each group 
were picked for collecting colonic contents samples. 16S rRNA sequencing was 
performed to analyze the colonic microbiota of experimental pigs.
RESULTS: The results showed that community richness indexes Chao1 and 
Observed_species in group III of Hezuo pig were significantly lower than that of 
the other three groups, community diversity indexes Shannon and Simpson were 
significantly higher in group I and II in comparison to the control group, and 
significantly lower in group III in comparison to the control group, group I and 
II. Adding WPCS to the diet of Hezuo pigs has no influence on the colonic 
dominant phylum, Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group 
were most prevalent in the colon of Hezuo pig. When compared with the control 
group, the relative abundance of Streptococcus was significantly decreased in 
three experimental groups, while p-251-o5, Parabacteroides, Prevotellaceae 
UCG-003, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and F082 exhibited significantly higher 
relative abundances in at least two experimental groups. Fibrobacter, 
Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group in group I, UCG-010 in group II, Bacteroides in 
group III exhibited increased relative abundance as compared with the control 
group. PICRUSt functional annotation indicated that the functions of cellular 
process and signaling were significantly increased in all WPCS-rationed groups, 
cancers, nervous system, immune system and environmental adaptation were all 
differed from groups I and II; three predominant pathways of translation, 
nucleotide metabolism and signal were only differed from the group II.
CONCLUSIONS: Feeding with 5% and 10% WPCS for Hezuo pigs could improve their 
colonic microflora diversity, and increase the relative abundance of 
fiber-digesting bacteria, which may potentially help to improve the fibre 
digestibility of Hezuo pigs by regulating the microbial function of cellular 
process and signaling, nucleotide metabolism, translation.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the possible changes of the oral microbiome during 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy (CT) and to investigate the potential relationship 
between the oral microbiome, the presence of oral mucositis (OM) and febrile 
neutropenia (FN).
METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study was conducted in 
patients receiving myelosuppressive CT for a solid tumor or lymphoma. Oral 
rinsing samples were retrieved before, during and after the start of CT, but 
also when OM or FN was present. The samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing and statistical analysis was performed using alpha (Shannon) 
and beta (PERMANOVA) diversity analyses. Furthermore, differential abundances 
were analyzed using ALDEx2v1.32.0. Differences between groups were calculated 
using the Mann Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
using R.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients, with a mean follow up of 114 days, were included 
for analysis and a total of 138 oral rinsing samples were available in the 
CLR-transformed data for PERMANOVA and 137 samples-for alpha diversity 
calculation. Significant changes in alpha diversity were seen when OM or FN was 
present. Moreover, significant changes were seen in beta diversity during the 
course of the CT treatment and when OM was present. Genera showing substantial 
changes in relative abundance were Streptococcus during the course of CT 
treatment and Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Actinomyces and 
Leptotrichia when OM was present.
CONCLUSION: Changes in the oral microbiome were observed during the CT-regimen 
and when OM was present. Furthermore, changes of the oral microbiota during FN 
episodes were observed; however, larger studies should be performed to 
substantiate our results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 483 participants (141 
healthy controls and 342 patients with pPNs) from June 2022 and January 2024. 
Saliva samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene to assess microbial diversity and differential abundance. Seven advanced 
machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, 
multi-layer perceptron, naïve Bayes, random forest, gradient boosting decision 
tree, and LightGBM) were utilized to evaluate performance and identify key 
microorganisms, with fivefold cross-validation employed to ensure robustness. 
The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to explain the 
contribution of these core microbiotas to the predictive model. Additionally, 
the PICRUSt2 algorithm was used to predict the microbial functions.
RESULTS: The salivary microbial composition in pPNs group showed significantly 
lower α- and β-diversity compared to healthy controls. A high-accuracy LightGBM 
model was developed, identifying six core genera-Fusobacterium, Solobacterium, 
Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Atopobium, and Peptostreptococcus-as pPNs 
biomarkers. Additionally, a visualization pPNs risk prediction system was 
developed. The immune responses and metabolic activities differences in salivary 
microbiota between the patients with pPNs and healthy controls were revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential clinical applications of the 
salivary microbiota for enable earlier detection and targeted interventions, 
offering significant promise for advancing clinical management and improving 
patient outcomes in pPNs.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol drinking and gut microbiota are related to hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), but the specific relationship between them remains unclear.
AIMS: We aimed to establish the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis and 
develop machine learning (ML) models in predicting the occurrence of early-stage 
HCC.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients with early-stage HCC and 278 controls 
were recruited. Alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis was established 
through the mediation/moderation effect analyses. Eight ML algorithms including 
Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), 
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XGBoost) were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 160 pairs of individuals were included for analyses. The 
mediation effects of Genus_Catenibacterium (P = 0.024), Genus_Tyzzerella_4 
(P < 0.001), and Species_Tyzzerella_4 (P = 0.020) were discovered. The 
moderation effects of Family_Enterococcaceae (OR = 0.741, 95%CI:0.160-0.760, 
P = 0.017), Family_Leuconostocaceae (OR = 0.793, 95%CI:0.486-3.593, P = 0.010), 
Genus_Enterococcus (OR = 0.744, 95%CI:0.161-0.753, P = 0.017), 
Genus_Erysipelatoclostridium (OR = 0.693, 95%CI:0.062-0.672, P = 0.032), 
Genus_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.655, 95%CI:0.098-0.749, P = 0.011), 
Species_Enterococcus_faecium (OR = 0.692, 95%CI:0.061-0.673, P = 0.013), and 
Species_Lactobacillus (OR = 0.653, 95%CI:0.086-0.765, P = 0.014) were uncovered. 
The predictive power of eight ML models was satisfactory (AUCs:0.855-0.932). The 
XGBoost model had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.932).
CONCLUSIONS: ML models based on the alcohol drinking-gut microbiota-liver axis 
are valuable in predicting the occurrence of early-stage HCC.

The current study investigates the anticancer activity of protein derived from 
yeast against breast cancer. Yeast-derived proteins illustrate potential as an 
anticancer agent through mechanisms, such as immune system stimulation via 
beta-glucans, cytotoxic effects, and modulation of gut microbiota by probiotic 
strains. The antioxidant activity of yeast-derived proteins can aid in 
anticancer activity by neutralizing free radicals, thereby reducing oxidative 
stress and preventing damage to cellular DNA. Employing a comprehensive 
methodology encompassing yeast isolation, antioxidant screening, molecular 
characterization, bioactive protein purification, and MTT assay, the research 
provides crucial insights into the anticancer attributes of the protein 
extracted from the yeast. The findings reveal significant antioxidant activity 
that reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are implicated in 
cancer development. The MTT assay on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, 
characterized by estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity and 
HER-2 negativity, determined an IC50 value of 54.89 µg/ml, indicating a 
dose-dependent decrease in cytotoxic effects. These results suggest that the 
protein derived from Trichosporon asahii VITSTB1 exhibits promising anti-breast 
cancer properties. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying 
mechanisms, assess efficacy and safety profiles, explore synergies with existing 
therapies, and conduct animal model studies. Advancing this line of inquiry will 
significantly contribute to biomedical research and industrial innovation.

Sulfate- and sulfite-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a group of strict anaerobes 
found within the human gut. Bilophila wadsworthia, a sulfite-reducing bacterium 
which produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from taurine and isethionate respiration, 
is a common member of the healthy commensal human gut microbiota but has been 
implicated in several disease states including inflammatory bowel disease and 
colorectal cancer. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, one of the most prominent gut 
bacteria, has sulfatases which release sulfate, serving as a potential substrate 
for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Here, we showed that when B. thetaiotaomicron and 
B. wadsworthia were in co-culture, there was a significant increase in B. 
thetaiotaomicron's growth and in H2S production by B. wadsworthia. Differential 
gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of B. wadsworthia's 
dsrMKJOP complex in co-culture, which delivers electrons for sulfite reduction 
to H2S. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of genes associated with 
taurine, sulfolactate, and thiosulfate respiration, indicating that B. 
thetaiotaomicron may provide an alternative source of sulfite to B. wadsworthia. 
We hypothesized adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to be this intermediate. 
Indeed, B. wadsworthia was able to grow using APS or sulfite as electron 
acceptors. Endometabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed decreased 
production of indole by B. thetaiotaomicron in co-culture with B. wadsworthia 
due to enhanced tryptophan utilization by B. wadsworthia. The results of this 
microbe-microbe interaction could have significant pro-inflammatory effects in 
the human gut environment.

OBJECTIVE: To analysis the differential composition in vaginal microbial 
communities following HPV infection in Uygur and Han women, and to Explore the 
correlation between these difference and the degree of Human Papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection in Uygur women compared to Han women.
METHODS: A total of 151 Uygur and Han women, with and without HPV, were studied 
at Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Hospital (June 2021-June 2022). 
These participants were divided into six groups: Uygur control (CV), Uygur 
transient infection (TPV), Uygur persistent infection (PPV), Han control (CH), 
Han transient infection (TPH), Han persistent infection (PPH). Vaginal 
microbiota diversity and dominant bacteria with or without HPV infection were 
compared using 16S rDNA sequencing.
RESULTS: After HPV infection, vaginal pH increased significantly in Uygur and 
Han women. Vaginal environment cleanliness decreased notably only in Han women 
(P < 0.05). In Han women, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella dominated both with or 
without HPV infection. Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Atopobium decreased, while 
Sneathia increased significantly in persistent HPV cases. Among Uygur women, 
Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Shuttleworthia increased 
significantly in the TPV group, with lower Lactobacillus compared to CV and PPV 
groups. Bacterial diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson) were significantly 
lower in TPH compared to CH (P < 0.05), with no significant difference in PPH 
compared to CH (P > 0.05). Chao1 index was significantly lower in TPH than TPV 
(P < 0.05), with no difference between PPH and PPV (P > 0.05). CV group's Chao1 
index was significantly lower than CH (P < 0.01). PCoA and NMDS analyses showed 
distinct vaginal microbiota between TPH and TPV groups. LEfSe identified 20 
differentially expressed taxa in CH-TPH-PPH comparison and 17 in CV-TPV-PPV.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals ethnic-specific differences in vaginal microbial 
responses to HPV infection, with notable alterations in diversity and 
composition. The differential patterns observed between Uygur and Han women 
underscore the importance of considering host ethnicity in HPV-related microbial 
dysbiosis, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions targeting microbial 
signatures to enhance HPV prevention and management strategies.

The term "microbiome" refers to the collection of bacterial species that reside 
in the human body's tissues. Sometimes, it is used to refer to all microbial 
entities (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and others) which colonize the human body. 
It is now generally acknowledged that the microbiome plays a critical role in 
the host's physiological processes and general well-being. Changes in the 
structure and/or function of the microbiome (dysbiosis) are linked to the 
development of many diseases including cancer. The claim that because of their 
negatively charged membrane, cancer cells are more vulnerable to some bacteria 
than normal cells and that is how the link between these bacteria and cancer 
evolved has been refuted. Furthermore, the relationship between the microbiome 
and cancer is more evident in the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy. In 
this narrative review, we detailed the correlation between the presence/absence 
of specific bacterial species and the development, diagnosis, prognosis, and 
treatment of some types of cancer including colorectal, lung, breast, and 
prostate cancer. In addition, we discussed the mechanisms of microbiome-cancer 
interactions including genotoxin production, the role of free radicals, 
modification of signaling pathways in host cells, immune modulation, and 
modulation of drug metabolism by microbiome. Future directions and clinical 
application of microbiome in the early detection, prognosis, and treatment of 
cancer emphasizing on the role of fecal transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, 
and microbiome biomarkers were also considered.

Probiotics have been suggested to contribute to cancer prevention through 
various mechanisms. Additionally, recent studies have established a connection 
between diet, microbiota, and overall health. In this respect, the current study 
aims to understand the impact of crocin on possible anti-cancer and 
antibacterial effects of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) in colorectal cancer 
cells and pathogenic bacteria. The study involved collecting cell-free 
supernatants (CFSs) from untreated bacteria as a control group and bacteria 
treated with crocin, and then examining their ability to prevent the growth of 
HCT-116 colon cancer cells. It was demonstrated that L. lactis, when treated 
with crocin, can effectively combat against various types of pathogenic bacteria 
and can survive in acidic conditions. Both CFS and cro-CFS exhibited a 
dose-dependent inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth but crocin-treated bacteria 
showed more significant effects. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) for cell growth inhibition was 97.41 µL/mL in CSF group and 72.07 µL/mL 
in cro-CFS group. The results of flow cytometry tests confirmed the MTT assay 
findings, showing that cro-CFS group had a significantly higher rate of 
apoptosis compared to CFS of control group. The results obtained from qPCR also 
showed that the Caspase 9 and BAX genes were upregulated, and the BCL-2 
expression level was reduced in cells treated with cro-CFS compared to the CFS 
group. Overall, these findings suggest that crocin may alter the composition of 
CFS from probiotics that are present in the gut, potentially impacting their 
ability to combat cancer.

Background. The growing interest in microbiota-epigenetics-immune system 
research stems from the understanding that microbiota, a group of 
micro-organisms colonized in the human body, can influence the gene expression 
through epigenetic mechanisms and interaction with the immune system. 
Epigenetics refers to changes in gene activity that are not caused by the 
alteration in the DNA sequence itself.Discussion. The clinical significance of 
this research lies in the potential to develop new therapies for diseases linked 
to the imbalance of these microbial species (dysbiosis), such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. The intricate interaction between microbiota and 
epigenetics involves the production of metabolites and signalling molecules that 
can impact our health by influencing immune responses, metabolism and 
inflammation. Understanding these interactions could lead to novel therapeutic 
strategies targeting microbiota-epigenetic pathways to improve health 
outcomes.Conclusion. In this context, we aim to review and emphasize the current 
knowledge and key concepts that link the microbiota to epigenetics and immune 
system function, exploring their relevance to the development and maintenance of 
homeostasis and susceptibility to different diseases later in life. We aim to 
elucidate key concepts concerning the interactions and potential effects among 
the human gut microbiota, epigenetics, the immune system and ageing diseases 
linked to dysbiosis.

The aim of the present study was to provide a theoretical basis for the 
selection of standard sampling methods in the study of the esophageal microbiota 
in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by comparing the 
differences in bacterial communities between surgical and endoscopic esophageal 
mucosal tissues. A total of 72 patients with ESCC who were diagnosed at Taihe 
Hospital (Shiyan, China) between July 2018 and July 2019 were selected to 
participate in the present study. The sequence V4 hypervariable region was 
amplified, and Illumina HiSeq sequencing was performed to analyze the 
differences between the two groups. The Shannon and Chao1 indices of the 
postoperative esophageal cancer tissue group samples (Group A) were higher than 
those of the esophageal mucosa tissue samples (Group B), and the difference was 
statistically significant (P<0.05). The Simpson index of Group A was higher than 
that of Group B, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). The β 
diversity analysis demonstrated that the overall composition of the flora of the 
two groups was not significantly different. Linear discriminant analysis effect 
size analysis showed that the abundance of Megasphaera, Actinobacteria, 
Enterobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriales in Group A was significantly higher 
than that in Group B, but the abundance of Mogibacteriaceae in Group B was 
significantly higher than that in Group A. The top 60 species were selected 
using the random forest method to establish a model. The error rate of the 
prediction model constructed using the random forest method was 22.59%. The 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the 
present model was reliable and could effectively distinguish between the two 
groups of samples (area under the curve, 0.86). The source of the sample should 
be considered in studies investigating the esophageal flora. Considering the 
increased richness and improved uniformity of postoperative tissue microbiota 
compared with the mucosal group, it was predicted that postoperative tissue may 
be more conducive to the study of esophageal cancer microbiota.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a persistent and complex condition 
accomplished by inflammation of the gastrointestinal system, encompassing 
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This condition is caused by 
the combination of genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and 
dysregulated immunological responses, which complicates diagnosis and treatment. 
The latest developments in gastroenterology have revealed the critical 
significance of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) are a type of microbial component that potentially regulate 
intestinal inflammation. The impact of microbiota-derived bacterial EVs (bEVs) 
on intestinal inflammation is mediated through several methods. They can 
intensify inflammation or stimulate defensive responses by delivering 
immunomodulatory cargo. Improved comprehension could enhance inventive 
diagnostic and treatment strategies for IBD. This study aimed to explore the 
relationship between microbiota-derived bEVs and the complex nature of IBD. We 
performed a thorough analysis of the formation, composition, mechanisms of 
action, diagnostic possibilities, therapeutic implications, and future prospects

Feature selection with vector-symbolic architectures: a case study on microbial 
profiles of shotgun metagenomic samples of colorectal cancer.

Cumbo F, Truglia S, Weitschek E, Blankenberg D.

The continuingly decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing has recently led 
to a significant increase in the number of microbiome-related studies, providing 
invaluable information for understanding host-microbiome interactions and their 
relation to diseases. A common approach in metagenomics consists of determining 
the composition of samples in terms of the amount and types of microbial species 
that populate them, with the goal to identify microbes whose profiles are able 
to differentiate samples under different conditions with advanced feature 
selection techniques. Here we propose a novel backward variable selection method 
based on the hyperdimensional computing paradigm, which takes inspiration from 
how the human brain works in the classification of concepts by encoding features 
into vectors in a high-dimensional space. We validated our method on public 
metagenomic samples collected from patients affected by colorectal cancer in a 
case/control scenario, by performing a comparative analysis with other 
state-of-the-art feature selection methods, obtaining promising results.
AUTHOR SUMMARY: Characterizing the microbial composition of metagenomic samples 
is crucial for identifying potential biomarkers that can distinguish between 
healthy and diseased states. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of 
metagenomic data present significant challenges in the context of accurately 
selecting features. Our backward variable selection method, based on the 
hyperdimensional computing paradigm, offers a promising approach to overcoming 
these challenges. By effectively reducing the feature space while preserving 
essential information, this method enhances the ability to detect critical 
microbial signatures associated with diseases like colorectal cancer, leading to 
more precise diagnostic tools.

The gut mycobiota is crucial for intestinal homeostasis and immune function1. 
Yet its variability and inconsistent fungal colonization of laboratory mice 
hinders the study of the evolutionary and immune processes that underpin 
commensalism2,3. Here, we show that Kazachstania pintolopesii is a fungal 
commensal in wild urban and rural mice, with an exceptional ability to colonize 
the mouse gastrointestinal tract and dominate the gut mycobiome. Kazachstania 
pintolopesii colonization occurs in a bacteria-independent manner, results in 
enhanced colonization resistance to other fungi and is shielded from host immune 
surveillance, allowing commensal presence. Following changes in the mucosal 
environment, K. pintolopesii colonization triggers a type 2 immune response in 
mice and induces gastrointestinal eosinophilia. Mechanistically, we determined 
that K. pintolopesii activates type 2 immunity via the induction of epithelial 
IL-33 and downstream IL-33-ST2 signalling during mucus fluctuations. 
Kazachstania pintolopesii-induced type 2 immunity enhanced resistance to 
helminth infections or aggravated gastrointestinal allergy in a 
context-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that K. pintolopesii is a mouse 
commensal and serves as a valuable model organism for studying gut fungal 
commensalism and immunity in its native host. Its unnoticed presence in mouse 
facilities highlights the need to evaluate its influence on experimental 
outcomes and phenotypes.

The success of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in curing 
hematologic disorders is limited by its short- and long-term toxicities. One 
such toxicity is oral mucositis (OM), causing pain, speech/swallowing 
difficulty, and prolonged hospitalization. Although conditioning 
chemoradiotherapy is the direct cause of OM, potential host-intrinsic mediators 
of mucosal injury remain elusive. We hypothesized that the oral microbiota may 
influence OM severity. We used a validated comprehensive scoring system based on 
specialized Oral Medicine examinations to longitudinally quantify OM severity in 
alloHCT recipients. High-throughput multi-site profiling of the oral microbiota 
was performed in parallel. We identify a sex-dependent commensal bacterium, 
Oribacterium asaccharolyticum, whose presence in saliva before transplantation 
is associated with more severe OM 14 days after transplantation. The sex 
predilection of this species correlated with higher uric acid levels in men. Our 
findings represent the first sex-dependent microbiota-mediated pathway in OM 
pathogenesis and introduce novel targets for preventative interventions.

The recent discovery by Lu and colleagues of Tomasiella immunophila, a bacterium 
that degrades IgA, offers insights into microbial influences on mucosal immunity 
and evolutionary immune trade-offs. By modulating IgA titers, T. immunophila 
influences the dynamic interactions and balance between the host and pathogen. 
This has implications for immune health, microbiome research, and therapeutics.

The efficacy of immunotherapy in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
has been restricted due to its low immunogenicity and suppressive immune 
microenvironment. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have emerged as 
innovative immunotherapeutic agents in antitumor therapy by stimulating the 
innate immune system, but intricate modifications and undesirable multiple dose 
administration severely hinder their utility. Herein, a two-step bacterial 
metabolic labeling technique was utilized for the bioorthogonal engineering of 
OMVs. At first, d-propargylglycine (DPG, an alkyne-containing d-amino acid) was 
introduced into the incubation process of probiotic Escherichia coli 1917 (Ecn) 
to produce DPG-functionalized OMVs, which were subsequently conjugated with 
azide-functionalized new indocyanine green (IR820) to yield OMV-DPG-IR820. The 
combination of phototherapy and immunostimulation of OMV-DPG-IR820 effectively 
arouses adaptive immune responses, causing maturation of dendritic cells, 
infiltration of T cells, repolarization of the M2 macrophage to the M1 
macrophage, and upregulation of inflammatory factors. Remarkably, OMV-DPG-IR820 
demonstrated tumor-targeting capabilities with guidance provided by 
near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging, leading to remarkable inhibition 
on both primary and distant tumors and preventing metastasis without causing 
noticeable adverse reactions. This study elucidates a sophisticated 
bioorthogonal engineering strategy for the design and production of 
functionalized OMVs and provides novel perspectives on the microbiome-mediated 
reversal of TNBC through a precise and efficient immunotherapy.

Edible fungal polysaccharides have emerged as significant bioactive compounds 
with diverse therapeutic potentials, including notable anti-tumor effects. 
Derived from various fungal sources, these polysaccharides exhibit complex 
biological activities such as antioxidant, immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, 
and anti-obesity properties. In cancer therapy, members of this family show 
promise in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis through mechanisms like 
apoptosis induction and modulation of the immune system. This review provides a 
detailed examination of contemporary techniques for the targeted isolation and 
structural elucidation of edible fungal polysaccharides. Additionally, the 
review highlights the application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) 
methodologies to facilitate efficient and accurate structural analysis of these 
polysaccharides. It also explores their interactions with immune cells within 
the tumor microenvironment and their role in modulating gut microbiota, which 
can enhance overall immune function and potentially reduce cancer risks. 
Clinical studies further demonstrate their efficacy in various cancer 
treatments. Overall, edible fungal polysaccharides represent a promising 
frontier in cancer therapy, leveraging their natural origins and minimal 
toxicity to offer novel strategies for comprehensive cancer management.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC), with a growing incidence trend, is one of 
the most diagnosed cancers and the second cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide. The literature has frequently focused attention on the correlation 
between the gut microbiota imbalance and CRC. The genera Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium have recently received increasing attention because of their 
potential in restoring alterations in the gut microflora. Therefore, this study 
aimed to quantitatively evaluate the presence of lactobacilli and 
bifidobacterial strains in the fecal samples of CRC patients compared to healthy 
volunteers.
METHODS: From 2018 to 2019, 25 confirmed CRC patients and 25 age- and 
gender-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study. Bacterial DNA was 
extracted from the fecal samples and the presence of lactobacilli and 
bifidobacterial strains were quantitatively determined using quantitative 
real-time PCR using genus-specific 16S rDNA primers.
RESULTS: A significant decline in the abundance of bifidobacteria in CRC 
patients compared to healthy individuals (p value<0.003) was observed; however, 
no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the 
abundance of lactobacilli (p value<0.163). Correlation analysis showed a 
positive association between the lack of genetic history of CRC and the numbers 
of gut bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
CONCLUSION: As a putative gut probiotic, depletion of bifidobacteria showed 
significant correlation to the development and progression of CRC; therefore, 
therapeutic use of these probiotic bacteria could be considered a possible 
adjuvant approach in disease management through modulation of the microbiota.

Most studies on the human gut microbiome have focused on the bacterial fraction 
rather than fungal biomics, which as resulted in an incomplete understanding of 
the fungal microbiome. Recent advances in microbiota detection and 
next-generation sequencing technology have boosted an increase in research on 
fungi. Symbiotic fungi have become increasingly influential in health and 
disease and modulate various physiologic functions within the host. Fungal 
infections can result in high morbidity and mortality rates and are 
life-threatening in some immunocompromised patients. In addition to bacterial 
dysbiosis, alterations in fungal communities are important and have been linked 
to many diseases, including asthma, mental illness, and various cancers. When 
investigating cancer it is imperative to consider the role of fungi alongside 
viruses and bacteria. This review examined the impact of intestinal fungi and 
peri-tumor fungi on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and response to 
anticancer therapies. The review highlights the specific involvement of some 
fungal species in cancers include digestive tract tumors such as colorectal, 
pancreatic, liver, and gastric cancers, as well as non-digestive tract tumors 
such as lung, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, fungal 
mechanisms of action, including fungus-host recognition and immune regulation, 
biofilm formation, toxin and metabolite production in the tumor 
microenvironment, and the complex effects of fungus-bacteria interactions on 
tumorigenesis and development, highlight the significance of potential 
biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a malignancy with a high incidence and poor prognosis, 
significantly influenced by dysbiosis in the esophageal, oral, and gut 
microbiota. This review provides an overview of the roles of microbiota 
dysbiosis in EC pathogenesis, emphasizing their impact on tumor progression, 
drug efficacy, biomarker discovery, and therapeutic interventions. Lifestyle 
factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut use are major 
contributors to dysbiosis and EC development. Recent studies utilizing advanced 
sequencing have revealed complex interactions between microbiota dysbiosis and 
EC, with oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium 
nucleatum promoting inflammation and suppressing immune responses, thereby 
driving carcinogenesis. Altered esophageal microbiota, characterized by reduced 
beneficial bacteria and increased pathogenic species, further exacerbate local 
inflammation and tumor growth. Gut microbiota dysbiosis also affects systemic 
immunity, influencing chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, with certain 
bacteria enhancing or inhibiting treatment responses. Microbiota composition 
shows potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection, prognosis, and 
personalized therapy. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota-such 
as probiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation-offer 
promising avenues to restore balance and improve treatment efficacy, potentially 
enhancing patient outcomes. Integrating microbiome-focused strategies into 
current therapeutic frameworks could improve EC management, reduce adverse 
effects, and enhance patient survival. These findings highlight the need for 
further research into microbiota-tumor interactions and microbial interventions 
to transform EC treatment and prevention, particularly in cases of late-stage 
diagnosis and poor treatment response.

BACKGROUND: Aging can impair the ability of elderly individuals to fight 
infections and trigger persistent systemic inflammation, a condition known as 
inflammaging. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of inflammaging 
remain unknown.
METHODS: We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing of intestinal contents from young and 
old C57BL/6J mice to elucidate changes in gut microbiota diversity and microbial 
community composition after aging. Aging-related differential bacterial taxa 
were then identified, and their abundance trends were validated in human 
samples. The variances in intestinal barrier function and circulating endotoxin 
between groups were also assessed. Furthermore, widely targeted metabolomics was 
conducted to characterize metabolic profiles after aging and to investigate the 
key metabolic pathways enriched by the differential metabolites.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated an increase in relative proportion of 
pathogenic bacteria with age, a trend also revealed in healthy populations of 
different age groups. Additionally, aging individuals exhibited reduced 
intestinal barrier function and increased circulating endotoxin levels. Widely 
targeted metabolomics revealed a significant increase in various secondary bile 
acid metabolites after aging, positively correlated with the relative abundance 
of several aging-related bacterial taxa. Furthermore, old group had lower levels 
of various anti-inflammatory or beneficial metabolites. Enrichment analysis 
identified the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway as potentially the most 
significantly impacted signaling pathway during aging.
CONCLUSION: This study aimed to provide insights into the complex interactions 
involved in organismal inflammaging through microbial multi-omics. These 
findings lay a solid foundation for future research aimed at identifying novel 
biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of aging-related diseases or potential 
therapeutic targets.

Gut microbiota composition has been implicated in surgical site complications 
after colorectal cancer surgery. Antibiotics affect gut microbiota, but evidence 
for a role in surgical site complications is inconclusive. We aimed to 
investigate use of prescription antibiotics during the years before surgery in 
relation to the risk of surgical site infections, including anastomotic leakage, 
within 30 days after surgery. Cardiovascular/neurological complications and the 
urinary antiseptic methenamine hippurate, for which there is no clear link with 
the microbiota, were used as negative controls. We conducted a patient cohort 
study using complete population data from Swedish national registers between 
2005 and 2020. The final study population comprised 26,527 colon cancer and 
12,312 rectal cancer cases with a 4.5 year exposure window. In colon cancer 
patients, antibiotics use was associated with a higher risk of surgical site 
infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for any versus no use = 1.20, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.33) and anastomotic leakage in particular (aOR 
=1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.36), both with dose-response relationships for increasing 
cumulative antibiotics use (Ptrend = <0.001 and Ptrend = 0.047, respectively). 
Conversely, associations in rectal cancer patients, as well as for the negative 
controls cardiovascular/neurological complications and methenamine hippurate, 
were null. In conclusion, prescription antibiotics use up to 4.5 years before 
colorectal cancer surgery is associated with a higher risk of surgical site 
infections, including anastomotic leakage, after colon cancer but not rectal 
cancer surgery. These findings support a role for antibiotics-induced intestinal 
dysbiosis in surgical site infections.

Transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications play an important role in regulating mRNA 
translation at the codon level. tRNA modifications can influence codon selection 
and optimality, thus shifting translation toward specific sets of mRNAs in a 
dynamic manner. Queuosine (Q) is a tRNA modification occurring at the wobble 
position. In eukaryotes, queuosine is synthesized by the tRNA-guanine 
trans-glycosylase (TGT) complex, which incorporates the nucleobase queuine (or 
Qbase) into guanine of the GUN anticodons. Queuine is sourced from gut bacteria 
and dietary intake. Q was recently shown to be critical for cellular responses 
to oxidative and mitochondrial stresses, as well as its potential role in 
neurodegenerative diseases and brain health. These unique features of Q provide 
an interesting insight into the regulation of mRNA translation by gut bacteria, 
and the potential health implications. In this review, Q biology is examined in 
the light of recent literature and nearly 4 decades of research. Q's role in 
neuropsychiatric diseases and cancer is highlighted and discussed. Given the 
recent interest in Q, and the new findings, more research is needed to fully 
comprehend its biological function and disease relevance, especially in 
neurobiology.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor. Current 
standard-of-care treatments offer limited benefits for patient survival. 
Virotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to use oncolytic viruses (OVs) for 
the treatment of GBM. These engineered and non-engineered viruses infect and 
lyse cancer cells, causing tumor destruction without harming healthy cells. 
Recent advances in genetic modifications to OVs have helped improve their 
targeting capabilities and introduce therapeutic genes, broadening the 
therapeutic window and minimizing potential side effects. The efficacy of 
oncolytic virotherapy can be enhanced by combining it with other treatments such 
as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiation. Recent studies suggest that 
manipulating the gut microbiome to enhance immune responses helps improve the 
therapeutic efficacy of the OVs. This narrative review intends to explore OVs 
and their role against solid tumors, especially GBM while emphasizing the latest 
technologies used to enhance and improve its therapeutic and clinical responses.

Background/Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder 
in women of reproductive age characterized by insulin resistance and hormonal 
imbalances. Recent research suggests that probiotics and synbiotics may improve 
these parameters by modulating the gut microbiota. This study systematically 
reviewed randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of probiotic, 
prebiotic, and synbiotic supplementation on insulin resistance and hormonal 
parameters in women with PCOS. Methods: Exhaustive searches were conducted in 
PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, following PRISMA 
guidelines. Randomized trials assessing supplementation with probiotics, 
prebiotics, or synbiotics for at least 8 weeks in women diagnosed with PCOS 
according to the Rotterdam criteria were included. Data on participants, 
interventions, and outcomes related to insulin resistance and hormones were 
extracted. Results: Eleven studies from Iran involving overweight or obese women 
aged 15 to 48 were included. Probiotic and synbiotic supplementation showed 
significant improvements in insulin resistance (reductions in HOMA-IR, fasting 
glucose, and insulin), lipid profiles (decreased LDL and triglycerides; 
increased HDL), and hormonal balance (increased SHBG, decreased total 
testosterone). Synbiotics had more pronounced effects than probiotics or 
prebiotics alone. Adherence was high, and side effects were minimal. 
Conclusions: Despite promising results, limitations such as small sample sizes, 
homogeneous populations, and short intervention durations limit the 
generalization of the findings. Larger, longer, multicenter trials with diverse 
populations and standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the efficacy 
and safety of synbiotics in managing PCOS. Integrating these interventions could 
improve clinical management and quality of life for affected women, but 
additional evidence is required to support widespread use.

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits are crucial for preventing many diseases, 
particularly in children and adolescents. Accurate assessment of dietary intake 
is essential for understanding the relationship between diet and health in these 
age groups.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of a 
Spanish version of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition (EPIC) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) in 150 Spanish children and 
adolescents aged 10 to 17 using the average of 9 days of 24-h dietary recall 
(24H-DR) as a reference.
METHODS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to asses 
reproducibility and Spearman/Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to 
assess validity and reproducibility.
RESULTS: The average ICCs were 0.41 for crude nutrients, 0.31 for food groups, 
0.31 for energy-adjusted nutrients, and 0.4 for energy-adjusted food groups. 
Spearman/Pearson correlation coefficients averaged 0.39 and 0.41 for crude and 
energy-adjusted nutrients, respectively, and 0.51 and 0.47 for corresponding 
food groups. Regarding validity, the average correlation coefficient for crude, 
energy-adjusted, and de-attenuated nutrients was 0.32, 0.50, and 0.50, 
respectively. The highest crude coefficient was 0.50 for vitamin C and fiber, 
while the highest energy-adjusted coefficient was 0.76 for protein and 
carbohydrates. The highest de-attenuated coefficient was 0.72 for vitamin B6.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the EPIC FFQ is a valid and 
reliable instrument for assessing dietary intake in Spanish children and 
adolescents.

Plant biotechnology creates opportunities for the cultivation of plants 
regardless of their natural habitats, which are often protected or difficult to 
access. Maintaining suspension cell cultures in bioreactors is an advanced part 
of biotechnological research that provides possibilities for obtaining plant 
tissue on a large scale. In this study, the suspension culture cultivation of a 
Chinese endemic plant, Schisandra henryi, in a stirred tank bioreactor was 
elaborated for the first time. The phytochemical profile of the tissue extracts 
was determined with UHPLC-MS/MS for the lignans (fifteen dibenzocyclooctadiene 
lignans, one aryltetralin lignan, and two neolignans) and UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS3 for 
the phenolic compounds (procyanidins and their derivatives and catechin). The 
maximum total lignan content of 1289 µg/100 g DW was detected for the extracts 
from suspensions cultured in a bioreactor for over 10 days. For the phenolic 
compounds, catechin was the dominant compound (390.44 mg/100 g DW). The 
biological activity of the extracts was tested too. To determine antioxidant 
potential we used DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS 
(2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), Molybdenum reduction, 
and β-carotene bleaching tests. The inhibition activity of the S. henryi extract 
on the enzymes responsible for skin aging, hyaluronidase and tyrosinase, was 
assessed with spectrophotometry. The cytotoxic activity of the extracts was 
estimated on human ovarian SKOV-3, cervical HeLa, and gastric AGS cancer cells 
and non-cancer, normal fibroblasts by an MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The 
results showed the great potential of the obtained cell biomass extracts. The 
results of the antioxidant tests indicated their strong ability to reduce the 
level of free radicals, similarly to that of ascorbic acid, as well as the weak 
capacity to protect lipids from oxidation. Moreover, anticancer potential, 
particularly on the cervical and gastric cancer cells, was confirmed too.

The human gut is a complex ecosystem that supports billions of living species, 
including bacteria, viruses, archaea, phages, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes. 
Bacteria give genes and enzymes for microbial and host-produced compounds, 
establishing a symbiotic link between the external environment and the host at 
both the gut and systemic levels. The gut microbiome, which is primarily made up 
of commensal bacteria, is critical for maintaining the healthy host's immune 
system, aiding digestion, synthesizing essential nutrients, and protecting 
against pathogenic bacteria, as well as influencing endocrine, neural, humoral, 
and immunological functions and metabolic pathways. Qualitative, quantitative, 
and/or topographic shifts can alter the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis 
and microbial dysfunction, which can contribute to a variety of noncommunicable 
illnesses, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. While most 
evidence to date is observational and does not establish direct causation, 
ongoing clinical trials and advanced genomic techniques are steadily enhancing 
our understanding of these intricate interactions. This review will explore key 
aspects of the relationship between gut microbiota, eubiosis, and dysbiosis in 
human health and disease, highlighting emerging strategies for microbiome 
engineering as potential therapeutic approaches for various conditions.

This review explores the complex relationship between gut dysbiosis and 
hematological malignancies, focusing on graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. We 
discuss how alterations in microbial diversity and composition can influence 
disease development, progression, and treatment outcomes in blood cancers. The 
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota impacts these conditions are examined, 
including modulation of immune responses, production of metabolites, and effects 
on intestinal barrier function. Recent advances in microbiome-based therapies 
for treating and preventing GvHD are highlighted, with emphasis on full 
ecosystem standardized donor-derived products. Overall, this review underscores 
the growing importance of microbiome research in hematology-oncology and its 
potential to complement existing treatments and improve outcomes for thousands 
of patients worldwide.

Cancers of the nose, and especially the nose vestibule, represent a significant 
challenge for clinicians due to their rarity, the intricate nature of 
surrounding vital structures, the nonspecific early symptoms, and the 
etiological factors that are not completely understood. Emerging research 
suggests that alterations in the nasal microbiome, also known as microbial 
dysbiosis, may contribute to the pathogenesis of those malignancies through 
mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, immune modulation, and cellular 
changes. The aims of this paper are to review the current literature covering 
the nasal microbiome's role in carcinogenesis, particularly in the context of 
squamous cell carcinoma, and to explore how microbial dysbiosis might foster a 
pro-tumorigenic environment. It further discusses potential future directions 
for research and therapeutic approaches.

Background and Objectives: In this study, we aimed to explore the oral bacteria 
and fungi that can help discern oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 
investigate the correlations between multiple key pathogens. Materials and 
Methods: Twelve participants (8 females and 4 males; mean age, 54.33 ± 20.65 
years) were prospectively recruited into three groups: Group 1: healthy control, 
Group 2: patients with stomatitis, and Group 3: patients with OSCC, with 4 
individuals in each group. Unstimulated whole saliva samples from these 
participants were analyzed using real-time PCR to assess the presence and 
abundance of 14 major oral bacterial species and Candida albicans. Results: The 
analysis revealed significant differences for certain microorganisms, namely, 
Treponema denticola (T. denticola), Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), and Candida 
albicans. T. denticola was most abundant in the OSCC group (5,358,692.95 ± 
3,540,767.33), compared to the stomatitis (123,355.54 ± 197,490.86) and healthy 
control (9999.21 ± 11,998.40) groups. L. casei was undetectable in the healthy 
control group but was significantly more abundant in the stomatitis group 
(1653.94 ± 2981.98) and even higher in the OSCC group (21,336.95 ± 9258.79) (p = 
0.001). A similar trend was observed for C. albicans, with DNA copy numbers 
rising from the healthy control (464.29 ± 716.76) to the stomatitis (1861.30 ± 
1206.15) to the OSCC group (9347.98 ± 5128.54) (p = 0.006). The amount of T. 
denticola was positively correlated with L. casei (r = 0.890, p < 0.001) and C. 
albicans (r = 0.724, p = 0.008). L. casei's DNA copy number was strongly 
correlated with C. albicans (r = 0.931, p < 0.001). These three oral microbes 
exhibited strong positive correlations with each other and had various direct or 
indirect relationships with other species. Conclusions: In the OSCC group, T. 
denticola, L. casei, and C. albicans exhibited strong positive correlations with 
one another, further emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the 
complex microbial interactions in the OSCC environment.

Background:Lactiplantibacillus plantarum can inhibit the growth of 
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and modulate the gut microbiome. However, 
data on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are scarce. Aim: In an 
observational study, we assessed the impact of L. plantarum on the modulation of 
the gut microbiome in HSCT patients colonized by MDROs. Methods: Participants 
were allocated to an intervention group (IG = 22) who received capsules of L. 
plantarum (5 × 109 CFU) twice per day until the onset of neutropenia or a 
control group (CG = 20). The V4 region of the 16S bacterial rRNA gene was 
sequenced in 87 stool samples from a subset of 33 patients (IG = 20 and CG = 
13). The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of 
Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) program was used to predict metagenome functions. 
Results:L. plantarum demonstrated an average 86% (±11%) drug-target engagement 
at 43 (±29) days of consumption and was deemed safe, well-tolerated, and 
associated with an increase in the abundance of the Lactobacillales (p < 0.05). 
A significant increase in Lactococcus and a reduction in Turicibacter (p < 0.05) 
were identified on the second week of L. plantarum use. Although Enterococcus 
abundance had a greater rise in the CG (p = 0.07), there were no significant 
differences concerning the Gram-negative MDROs. No serious adverse effects were 
reported in the IG. We observed a greater, non-significant pyruvate fermentation 
to propanoate I (p = 0.193) relative abundance in the IG compared with the CG. 
L. plantarum use was safe and tolerable by HSCT patients. Conclusions: While L. 
plantarum is safe and may impact Enterococcus and Turicibacter abundance, it 
showed no impact on Gram-negative MDRO abundance in HSCT patients.

The contribution of nutritional factors to disease development has been 
demonstrated for several chronic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
metabolic syndrome, and about 30 percent of cancers. Nutrients include 
macronutrients and micronutrients, which are required in large and trace 
quantities, respectively. Macronutrients, which include protein, carbohydrates, 
and lipids, are mainly involved in energy production and biomolecule synthesis; 
micronutrients include vitamins and minerals, which are mainly involved in 
immune functions, enzymatic reactions, blood clotting, and gene transcription. 
Among the numerous micronutrients potentially involved in disease development, 
the present review will focus on iron and its relation to tumor development. 
Recent advances in the understanding of iron-related proteins accumulating in 
the tumor microenvironment shed light on the pivotal role of iron availability 
in sustaining pathological tumor hallmarks, including cell cycle regulation, 
angiogenesis, and metastasis.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global morbidity and 
mortality. Recent advancements in high-throughput omics techniques have enhanced 
our understanding of the human microbiome's role in the development of CVDs. 
Although the relationship between the gut microbiome and CVDs has attracted 
considerable research attention and has been rapidly evolving in recent years, 
the role of the oral microbiome remains less understood, with most prior studies 
focusing on periodontitis-related pathogens. In this review, we summarized 
previously reported associations between the oral microbiome and CVD, 
highlighting known CVD-associated taxa such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. We also 
discussed the interactions between the oral and gut microbes. The potential 
mechanisms by which the oral microbiota can influence CVD development include 
oral and systemic inflammation, immune responses, cytokine release, 
translocation of oral bacteria into the bloodstream, and the impact of 
microbial-related products such as microbial metabolites (e.g., short-chain 
fatty acids [SCFAs], trimethylamine oxide [TMAO], hydrogen sulfide [H2S], nitric 
oxide [NO]) and specific toxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS], leukotoxin 
[LtxA]). The processes driven by these mechanisms may contribute to 
atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and other cardiovascular pathologies. 
Integrated multi-omics methodologies, along with large-scale longitudinal 
population studies and intervention studies, will facilitate a deeper 
understanding of the metabolic and functional roles of the oral microbiome in 
cardiovascular health. This fundamental knowledge will support the development 
of targeted interventions and effective therapies to prevent or reduce the 
progression from cardiovascular risk to clinical CVD events.

Obesity, a global public health problem, is constantly increasing, so the 
concerns in preventing and combating it are increasingly focused on the 
intestinal microbiota. It was found that the microbiota is different in lean 
people compared to obese individuals, but the exact mechanisms by which energy 
homeostasis is influenced are still incompletely known. Numerous studies show 
the involvement of certain bacterial species in promoting obesity and associated 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc. Our aim is to summarize 
the main findings regarding the influence of several factors such as lifestyle 
changes, including diet and bariatric surgery, on the diversity of the gut 
microbiota in obese individuals. The second purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the potential effect of various microbiota modulation techniques on 
ameliorating obesity and its comorbidities. A literature search was conducted 
using the PubMed database, identifying articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
Most studies identified suggest that obesity is generally associated with 
alterations of the gut microbiome such as decreased microbial diversity, an 
increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased SCFAs levels. Our 
findings also indicate that gut microbiota modulation techniques could represent 
a novel strategy in treating obesity and related metabolic diseases. Although 
some mechanisms (e.g., inflammation or hormonal regulation) are already 
considered a powerful connection between gut microbiota and obesity development, 
further research is needed to enhance the knowledge on this particular topic.

The gut microbiome is essential for regulating host metabolism, defending 
against pathogens, and shaping the host's immune system. Mounting evidence 
highlights that disruption in gut microbial communities significantly impacts 
cancer development and treatment. Moreover, tumor-associated microbiota, along 
with its metabolites and toxins, may contribute to cancer progression by 
promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and metastatic 
spread to distant organs. Bones, in particular, are common sites for metastasis 
due to a rich supply of growth and neovascularization factors and extensive 
blood flow, especially affecting patients with thyroid, prostate, breast, lung, 
and kidney cancers, where bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. 
While the involvement of the gut microbiome in bone metastasis formation is 
still being explored, proposed mechanisms suggest that intestinal dysbiosis may 
alter the bone microenvironment via the gut-immune-bone axis, fostering a 
premetastatic niche and immunosuppressive milieu suitable for cancer cell 
colonization. Disruption in the delicate balance of bone modeling and remodeling 
may further create a favorable environment for metastatic growth. This review 
focuses on the link between beneficial or dysbiotic microbiome composition and 
bone homeostasis, as well as the role of the microbiome in bone metastasis 
development. It also provides an overview of clinical trials evaluating the 
impact of gut microbial community structure on bone parameters across various 
conditions or health-related issues. Dietary interventions and microbiota 
modulation via probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation help 
support bone health and might offer promising strategies for addressing 
bone-related complications in cancer.

The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that influences digestion, immune 
response, metabolism, and has been linked to health and well-being. Choline is 
essential for neurotransmitters, lipid transport, cell-membrane signaling, 
methyl-group metabolism and is believed to have neuroprotective properties. It 
is found in two forms, water-soluble and lipid-soluble, and its metabolism is 
different. Long-term choline deficiency is associated with many diseases, and 
supplements are prescribed for improved health. Choline supplements can improve 
cognitive function in adults but not significantly. Choline is a precursor of 
phospholipids and an acetylcholine neurotransmitter precursor and can be 
generated de novo from phosphatidylcholine via 
phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase and choline oxidase. Choline 
supplementation has been found to have a beneficial effect on patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), by increasing 
amyloid-β, thioflavin S, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Choline supplementation 
has been shown to reduce amyloid-plaque load and develop spatial memory in an 
APP/PS1 mice model of AD. Choline is necessary for normative and improved 
function of brain pathways and can reduce amyloid-β deposition and microgliosis. 
Clinical research suggests that early neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) can 
benefit from a combination of choline supplements and the drugs currently used 
to treat NDs in order to improve memory performance and synaptic functioning.

Studies increasingly support the role of the gut microbiota in glioma 
development and treatment, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. 
Research indicates that the gut microbiota can influence glioma progression, 
response to therapies, and the effectiveness of treatments like immunotherapy, 
with certain microbial compositions being linked to better outcomes. 
Additionally, the gut microbiota impacts the tumor microenvironment, affecting 
both tumor growth and the response to treatment. This review will explore 
glioma, the gut microbiota, and how their interaction shapes glioma development 
and therapy responses. Additionally, this review examines the influence of gut 
microbiota metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and tryptophan, 
on glioma development and treatment. It also explores gut microbiome signaling 
via pattern recognition receptors, and the role of molecular mimicry between 
microbial and tumor antigens in glioblastoma, and if these interactions affect 
glioma development and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins (PACs) from black soybean seed coat have 
antioxidant and anti-tumorigenic properties. We investigated the anti-tumor 
properties and mechanisms of action of PACs on colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We fed the APCmin/+ mice, which are highly susceptible to spontaneous 
intestinal adenoma formation, diets supplemented with or without PACs for 7 
weeks and assessed adverse effects, the number and size of intestinal polyps, 
and the expression of pro- and anti-proliferative proteins in the intestine. The 
mouse gut microbiome composition was analyzed, and the concentrations of gut 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified. We also compared CRC incidence 
in Tamba in Japan, where black soybean is consumed frequently, with that in the 
rest of Japan.
RESULTS: The number and size of intestinal polyps notably decreased in the 
PAC-fed mice. Compared with control mice, the PAC-fed mice showed lower 
expression of proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen and β 
catenin and a higher expression of the anti-inflammatory protein oligomeric 
mucus gel-forming. PAC supplementation increased the prevalence and 
concentrations of beneficial gut microbes and SCFAs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet supplemented with black soybean-derived PACs could prevent CRC 
development in mice through gut microbiome remodeling. Regions consuming black 
soybeans have low CRC incidence. Notably, the incidence of CRC, breast cancer, 
and liver cancer was significantly lower in Tamba than in the rest of Hyogo 
Prefecture or Japan. Future studies should delineate the mechanisms underlying 
the CRC-protective effects of PACs. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate the 
potential of including PACs in dietary recommendations for cancer prevention.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease (MASLD) and 
alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are among the leading causes of liver 
disease worldwide. The exact roles of epigenetic factors in both diseases 
remains largely unknown. In this context, liver DNA methylation remains a field 
that requires further exploration and understanding.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of liver DNA methylation in humans 
with MASLD or ALD using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Library. We 
included human studies where liver DNA methylation was assessed in patients with 
MASLD and/or ALD. The Rayyan platform was used to select studies. Risk of bias 
was assessed with the "risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions" 
tool, ROBINS-I. We performed pathway analysis using the most important 
differentially methylated genes selected in each article.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included in this systematic review. The risk of 
bias was moderate to serious in all articles and bias due to confounding and 
patient selection was high. Sixteen common pathways, containing differentially 
methylated genes, including cancer pathways, were identified in both diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: There are common pathways, containing differentially methylated 
genes, in ALD and MASLD, such as pathways in cancer and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. In MASLD, the insulin 
signaling pathway is one of the most important, and in ALD, the MAPK signaling 
pathway is the most important. Our study adds one more piece to the puzzle of 
the mechanisms involved in steatotic liver disease.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related fatalities globally, related 
to inflammatory and gut microbiota imbalance. Brassica rapa L. polysaccharide 
(BP) is a functional compound, which is utilized by the gut microbiota to 
regulate immunity and metabolism. However, the effect of BP on lung cancer and 
whether it affects the "gut-lung" axis remains unclear. This study explored the 
intervention of BP in Lewis lung cancer (LLC) mice and its effect on the gut 
microbiota. The results revealed that BP reduced tumor weight and downregulated 
the expression of Ki67 protein. Additionally, BP reduced the content of 
inflammatory factors and growth factors, promoting tumor cell apoptosis and 
inhibiting the growth of LLC. The intervention of BP suppressed intestinal 
inflammation, preserved intestinal barrier integrity, and augmented the level of 
beneficial microbiota, such as Blautia and Bifidobacterium. Furthermore, BP 
significantly increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 
particularly butyrate and propionate. A correlation analysis showed significant 
correlations among the gut microbiota, SCFAs, inflammatory factors, and tight 
junction proteins. A functional analysis indicated that BP promoted amino acid 
metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. These findings suggested that BP had the 
potential to act as prebiotics to prevent disease and improve lung cancer 
progression by regulating the gut microbiota.

The rise in the incidence of cancer globally has led to a heightened interest in 
targeted therapies as a form of anticancer treatment. Key oncogenic targets, 
including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), and kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS), have 
emerged as focal points in the development of targeted agents. Research has 
investigated the impact of gut microbiota on the efficacy of various anticancer 
therapies, such as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, a 
notable gap exists in the literature regarding the relationship between gut 
microbiota and targeted agents. This review emphasizes how specific gut 
microbiota and gut microbiota metabolites, including butyrate, propionate, and 
ursodeoxycholic acid, interact with oncogenic pathways to modulate anti-tumor 
effects. Conversely, deoxycholic acid, lipopolysaccharide, and trimethylamine 
n-oxide may exert pro-tumor effects. Furthermore, modulation of the gut 
microbiota influences glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby enhancing the 
response to anti-KRAS agents and addressing diarrhea induced by tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. By elucidating the connection between gut microbiota and the 
EGFR/VEGF/KRAS pathways, this review provides valuable insights for advancing 
targeted cancer therapy and optimizing treatment outcomes in clinical settings.

Gut microbiota has a proven link with the development and treatment of cancer. 
However, the causality between gut microbiota and cancer development is still 
unknown and deserves exploration. In this study, we aimed to explore the 
alterations in gut microbiota in murine tumor models and the crosstalk between 
the tumor and the gut microbiota. The subcutaneous and intravenous murine tumor 
models using both the colorectal cancer cell line MC38 and lung cancer cell line 
LLC were constructed. Then fecal samples before and after tumor inoculation were 
collected for whole metagenomics sequencing. Both subcutaneous and metastatic 
tumors markedly elevated the α-diversity of the gut microbiota. Relative 
abundance of Ligilactobacillus and Lactobacillus was reduced after 
subcutaneously inoculating tumor cells, whereas Bacteroides and Duncaniella were 
reduced in metastatic tumors, regardless of tumor type. At the species level, 
Lachnospiraceae bacterium was enriched after both subcutaneous and intravenous 
tumors inoculation, whereas levels of Muribaculaceae bacterium Isolate-110 
(HZI), Ligilactobacillus murinus and Bacteroides acidifaciens reduced. Metabolic 
function analysis showed that the reductive pentose phosphate cycle, urea cycle, 
ketone body biosynthesis, ectoine biosynthesis, C4-dicarboxylic acid cycle, 
isoleucine biosynthesis, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), and uridine 
5'-monophosphate (UMP) biosynthesis were elevated after tumor inoculation, 
whereas the cofactor and vitamin biosynthesis were deficient. Principal 
coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that subcutaneous and metastatic tumors 
partially shared the same effect patterns on gut microbiota. Furthermore, fecal 
microbiota transplantation revealed that this altered microbiota could influence 
tumor growth. Taken together, this study demonstrated that both colorectal 
cancer (MC38) and non-colorectal cancer (LLC) can cause gut dysbiosis and 
metabolic imbalance, regardless of tumor type and process of tumor inoculation, 
and this dysbiosis influenced the tumor growth. This research gives novel 
insights into the crosstalk between tumors and the gut microbiota.

Milk-derived extracellular vesicles (mEVs) are emerging as promising therapeutic 
candidates due to their unique properties and versatile functions. These 
vesicles play a crucial role in immunomodulation by influencing macrophage 
differentiation and cytokine production, potentially aiding in the treatment of 
conditions such as bone loss, fibrosis, and cancer. mEVs also have the capacity 
to modulate gut microbiota composition, which may alleviate the symptoms of 
inflammatory bowel diseases and promote intestinal barrier integrity. Their 
potential as drug delivery vehicles is significant, enhancing the stability, 
solubility, and bioavailability of anticancer agents while supporting wound 
healing and reducing inflammation. Additionally, bovine mEVs exhibit anti-aging 
properties and protect skin cells from UV damage. As vaccine platforms, mEVs 
offer advantages including biocompatibility, antigen protection, and the ability 
to elicit robust immune responses through targeted delivery to specific immune 
cells. Despite these promising applications, challenges persist, including their 
complex roles in cancer, effective antigen loading, regulatory hurdles, and the 
need for standardized production methods. Achieving high targeting specificity 
and understanding the long-term effects of mEV-based therapies are essential for 
clinical translation. Ongoing research aims to optimize mEV production methods, 
enhance targeting capabilities, and conduct rigorous preclinical and clinical 
studies. By addressing these challenges, mEVs hold the potential to 
revolutionize vaccine development and targeted drug delivery, ultimately 
improving therapeutic outcomes across various medical fields.

Background: Untargeted lipidomics using collision-induced dissociation-based 
tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) is essential for biological and clinical 
applications. However, annotation confidence still relies on manual curation by 
analytical chemists, despite the development of various software tools for 
automatic spectral processing based on rule-based fragment annotations. Methods: 
In this study, we present a novel machine learning model, MS2Lipid, for the 
prediction of known lipid subclasses from MS/MS queries, providing an orthogonal 
approach to existing lipidomics software programs in determining the lipid 
subclass of ion features. We designed a new descriptor, MCH (mode of carbon and 
hydrogen), to increase the specificity of lipid subclass prediction in nominal 
mass resolution MS data. Results: The model, trained with 6760 and 6862 manually 
curated MS/MS spectra for the positive and negative ion modes, respectively, 
classified queries into one or several of 97 lipid subclasses, achieving an 
accuracy of 97.4% in the test set. The program was further validated using 
various datasets from different instruments and curators, with the average 
accuracy exceeding 87.2%. Using an integrated approach with molecular spectral 
networking, we demonstrated the utility of MS2Lipid by annotating 
microbiota-derived esterified bile acids, whose abundance was significantly 
increased in fecal samples of obese patients in a human cohort study. This 
suggests that the machine learning model provides an independent criterion for 
lipid subclass classification, enhancing the annotation of lipid metabolites 
within known lipid classes. Conclusions: MS2Lipid is a highly accurate machine 
learning model that enhances lipid subclass annotation from MS/MS data and 
provides an independent criterion.

The human microbiota represents a heterogeneous microbial community composed of 
several commensal, symbiotic, and even pathogenic microorganisms colonizing both 
the external and internal body surfaces. Despite the term "microbiota" being 
commonly used to identify microorganisms inhabiting the gut, several pieces of 
evidence suggest the presence of different microbiota physiologically colonizing 
other organs. In this context, several studies have also confirmed that microbes 
are integral components of tumor tissue in different types of cancer, 
constituting the so-called "intratumoral microbiota". The intratumoral 
microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer as 
well as to the efficacy of anticancer treatments. Indeed, intratumoral 
microbiota can contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis formation as some 
microbes can directly cause DNA damage, while others can induce the activation 
of proinflammatory responses or oncogenic pathways and alter the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). All these characteristics make the intratumoral 
microbiota an interesting topic to investigate for both diagnostic and 
prognostic purposes in order to improve the management of cancer patients. This 
review aims to gather the most recent data on the role of the intratumoral 
microbiota in cancer development, progression, and response to treatment, as 
well as its potential diagnostic and prognostic value.

The oral microbiome, comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, is 
essential for maintaining both oral and systemic health. This complex ecosystem 
includes over 700 bacterial species, such as Streptococcus mutans, which 
contributes to dental caries through acid production that demineralizes tooth 
enamel. Fungi like Candida and pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are 
also significant, as they can lead to periodontal diseases through inflammation 
and destruction of tooth-supporting structures. Dysbiosis, or microbial 
imbalance, is a key factor in the development of these oral diseases. 
Understanding the composition and functions of the oral microbiome is vital for 
creating targeted therapies for these conditions. Additionally, the kynurenine 
pathway, which processes the amino acid tryptophan, plays a crucial role in 
immune regulation, neuroprotection, and inflammation. Oral bacteria can 
metabolize tryptophan, influencing the production of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 
and quinolinic acid, thereby affecting the kynurenine system. The balance of 
microbial species in the oral cavity can impact tryptophan levels and its 
metabolites. This narrative review aims to explore the relationship between the 
oral microbiome, oral diseases, and the kynurenine system in relation to certain 
systemic diseases.

The genus Streptococcus is a heterogenous group of commensal and pathogenic 
bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the human body, including the female 
genital tract (FGT). In the FGT microbiome, streptococci represent two major 
groups: the pathogenic group B Streptococci (GBS) and the commensal viridans 
group streptococci (VGS). Though members of the VGS are frequently detected from 
the FGT, their role in the FGT microbiome remains underexplored. Here, we report 
the characterization of Streptococcus sp. K0074, isolated from the vaginal swab 
of an endometrial cancer patient admitted to the hospital, with no evidence of 
bacterial vaginosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain is a member 
of the commensal VGS and possibly represents a novel species in the mitis 
subgroup. The strain demonstrated the production of low molecular weight 
bacteriocin-like substance with narrow-spectrum antagonistic activity, affecting 
the growth, biofilm formation, and colonization of aerobic vaginitis 
(AV)-causing bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The 
putative bacteriocin exhibited cell membrane-permeabilizing activity and exerted 
negative regulatory effect on the accessory gene regulator and SaeRS 
two-component systems of MRSA. Collectively, our results suggest that the 
isolate may modulate the FGT microbiome by inhibiting or displacing specific 
pathogen. Furthermore, the results presented here highlight new perspectives 
regarding the existence of VGS in the FGT microbiome and in particular pinpoint 
the potential clinical significance of the isolated VGS strain Streptococcus sp. 
K0074 for the treatment of AV caused by MRSA.

Recent research has emphasized the critical importance of establishing the 
neonatal gut microbiota for overall health and immune system development, 
prompting deeper studies about the early formation of neonatal gut microbiota 
and its influencing factors. Various factors, including maternal and 
environmental factors, affect the early formation of neonatal gut microbiota, in 
which delivery mode has been considered as one of the most crucial influencing 
factors. In recent years, the increasing trend of cesarean section during 
childbirth has become a serious challenge for global public health. This review 
thoroughly analyzes the effects of vaginal delivery and cesarean section on the 
establishment of neonatal gut microbiota and the potential long-term impacts. In 
addition, we analyze and discuss interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, 
vaginal seeding, fecal microbiota transplantation, and breastfeeding to address 
the colonization defects of the neonatal gut microbiota caused by cesarean 
section, aiming to provide theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of 
colonization defects and related diseases in infants caused by cesarean section 
in clinical practice and to provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing the 
development of neonatal gut microbiota.

Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial advancement in pulmonary carcinoma 
treatment. Nevertheless, its unique side effects not only reduce patients' 
quality of life but also affect treatment efficacy, with severe cases 
potentially endangering the patient's life. This study uses bibliometric 
analysis to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis literature on IRAEs in 
lung cancer from 1991 to 2023, retrieved from the Web of Science database. The 
dataset was analyzed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to identify trends, key 
contributors, and emerging research areas. A total of 124 publications were 
analyzed, revealing a notable increase in research activity post-2015, with 
China and the USA contributing over 50% of the studies. This research highlights 
the importance of understanding IRAEs and suggests future investigations into 
the pulmonary microbiota and tumor microenvironment.

Therapeutic efficacy with durable responses has been demonstrated with several 
antibody drugs that block key immune checkpoint receptors, including PD-1, 
PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Despite the success of these drugs, a substantial proportion 
of patients do not benefit. Targeting multiple inhibitory pathways 
simultaneously to augment anti-tumor immunity has proven to be a promising 
approach. The emergence of Repulsive Guidance Molecule b (RGMb), a ligand for 
PD-L2, as a novel co-inhibitory pathway in T cells, together with its regulation 
by the gut microbiome, encouraged the discovery and development of fully human 
anti-RGMb antibodies. Here, we describe phage display-derived monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) 2C11 and 5C10 that bind human RGMb with high affinities of 
1.4 nM and 0.72 nM, respectively. Both mAbs 2C11 and 5C10 potently inhibited 
RGMb interaction with PD-L2. MAb 2C11 effectively inhibited RGMb interaction 
with bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2-4), while leaving RGMb 
interaction with Neogenin 1 (Neo1) unaffected. Conversely, mAb 5C10 disrupted 
RGMb interaction with Neo1 while maintaining RGMb binding to BMP2-4. These 
findings map the 2C11 epitope at the membrane-distal N-terminal region of RGMb, 
which coincides with both PD-L2- and BMP2-4-binding sites. The PD-L2 binding 
interface is likely positioned between RGMb's N-terminal BMP-binding and 
C-terminal Neo1-binding regions. The in vivo activity of mAb 2C11 in combination 
with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 was tested in MC38 and B16-OVA cancer models and 
demonstrated synergistic effects by significantly enhancing anti-tumor 
responses. These properties make mAb 2C11 a promising candidate for therapeutic 
use to overcome immune checkpoint inhibitor resistances, warranting further 
exploration in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming (MR) in cancer (CA) has been a focus of 
intense research in the recent two decades. This phenomenon has attracted great 
interest because it offers potential targets for cancer therapy. To capture the 
intellectual landscape of this field, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to 
assess the scientific output, major contributors, and trends in the MR/CA 
research.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search using the Web of Science to retrieve 
articles published on MR of cancer from 2006 until 2023. The bibliometric tools 
such as Biblioshiny, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel were used to identify the 
most prolific authors, institutions, citation patterns, and keywords. We also 
used co-citation analysis to map the conceptual structure of the field and 
identify influential publications. Furthermore, we examined the literature by 
analyzing publication years, citations, and research impact factors.
RESULTS: A total of 4,465 publications about MR/CA were retrieved. Publications 
on MR/CA increased rapidly from 2006 to 2023. Frontiers in Oncology published 
the most papers, while Cell Metabolism had the most citations. Highly cited 
papers were mainly published in Cancer Cell, Nature, Cell, Science and Cell 
Metabolism. China and the United States led the way in publications and 
contributed the most to MR/CA research. The University of Texas System, Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, and Fudan University were the most productive institutions. 
The profitable authors were Deberardinis Ralph J and Chiarugi Paola. The current 
topics included MR in tumorigenesis and progression of CA, MR of tumor cells and 
tumor microenvironment, the effect of MR on the CA treatment, the underlying 
mechanisms of MR (such as gene regulation, epigenetics, extracellular vesicles, 
and gut microbiota), and the modulation of MR. Some topics such as tumor 
microenvironment, lipid MR, circular RNA, long noncoding RNA, exosome, 
prognostic model, and immunotherapy may be the focus of MR/CA research in the 
next few years.
CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the global scientific output in the field of 
MR/CA research, analyzing its quantitative characteristics. It identified some 
significant and distinguished papers and compiled information regarding the 
current status and evolving trends of MR/CA research.

Metabolic-related diseases are chronic diseases caused by multiple factors, such 
as genetics and the environment. These diseases are difficult to cure and 
seriously affect human health. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), the second 
rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, plays an important role in 
cholesterol synthesis and alters the gut microbiota and tumor immunity. Research 
has shown that SQLE is expressed in many tissues and organs and is involved in 
the occurrence and development of various metabolic-related diseases, such as 
cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. SQLE 
inhibitors, such as terbinafine, NB598, natural compounds, and their 
derivatives, can effectively ameliorate fungal infections, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of recent 
research progress on the role of SQLE in metabolic-related diseases. Further 
research on the regulation of SQLE expression is highly important for developing 
drugs for the treatment of metabolic-related diseases with good pharmacological 
activity.

This cross-sectional study examined the association between gut microbiota 
composition and locomotive syndrome in 568 healthy Japanese adults (36.8% male, 
median age 58.5 years) using data from the Kanagawa "ME-BYO" Prospective Cohort 
Study. Locomotive syndrome was assessed using the 5-question Geriatric 
Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-5). Linear discriminant analysis effect size 
showed an enrichment of Actinobacteria and depletion of Firmicutes in GLFS-5 
positive individuals. Classification tree analysis identified three terminal 
nodes as GLFS-5 positive, with one node involving Holdemania. Participants aged 
≥70.0 and <78.0 years who did not consume probiotic foods and had ≥0.04% 
relative abundance of Holdemania were classified as at risk for locomotive 
syndrome. Our findings suggest a potential association between gut microbiota, 
particularly higher Holdemania abundance, and locomotive syndrome in older 
adults. This study provides insights into the complex relationship between gut 
microbiome composition and musculoskeletal health in aging populations. However, 
the cross-sectional design limits causal inference.

As a critical component of the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME), the 
resident microbiota promotes tumorigenesis across a variety of cancer types. 
Here, we integrated multiple types of omics data, including microbiome, 
transcriptome, and metabolome data, to investigate the functional role of 
intratumoral bacteria in gastric cancer (GC). The microbiome was used to 
categorize GC samples into six subtypes, and patients with a high abundance of 
Streptococcus or Pseudomonas had a markedly worse prognosis. Further assays 
revealed that Streptococcus anginosus (SA) promoted tumour cell proliferation 
and metastasis while suppressing the differentiation and infiltration of CD8+ T 
cells. However, antibiotic treatment significantly suppressed tumorigenesis in 
SA+ mice in vivo. We further demonstrated that the SA arginine pathway increased 
the abundance of ornithine, which may be a major contributor to reshaping of the 
TIME. Our findings demonstrated that SA, a novel risk factor, plays significant 
roles in the initiation and progression of GC, suggesting that SA might be a 
promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of GC.

Recent studies have identified a critical role of the diverse and dynamic 
microbiome in modulating various aspects of host physiology and intrinsic 
processes. However, the altered microbiome has also become a hallmark of cancer, 
which could influence the tumor microenvironment. Aberrations in epigenetic 
regulation of tumor suppressors, apoptotic genes, and oncogenes can accentuate 
breast cancer onset and progression. Interestingly, recent studies have 
established that the microbiota modulates the epigenetic mechanisms at global 
and gene-specific levels. While the mechanistic basis is unclear, the cross-talk 
between the microbiome and epigenetics influences breast cancer trajectory. 
Here, we review different epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian gene expression and 
summarize the host-associated microbiota distributed across the human body and 
their influence on cancer and other disease-related genes. Understanding this 
complex relationship between epigenetics and the microbiome holds promise for 
new insights into effective therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.

Breast cancer (BC) is yet a significant global health challenge across various 
populations including Ghana, though several studies on host-genome associated 
with BC have been investigated molecular mechanisms of BC development and 
progression, and candidate therapeutic agents. However, a little attention has 
been given on microbial genome in this regard, although alterations in 
microbiota and epigenetic modifications are recognized as substantial risk 
factors for BC. This study focused on identifying bacterial key genes (bKGs) 
associated with BC infections in the Ghanaian population and exploring potential 
drug molecules by targeting these bKGs through in silico analyses. At first, 16S 
rRNA bacterial sequence data were downloaded from NCBI database comprising 520 
samples from BC patients and 442 from healthy controls. Analysis of 16S rRNA-Seq 
data showed significant differences in bacterial abundance between BC and 
healthy groups and identified 26 differential genera with the threshold values 
at |log2FC|>2.0 and p-value≤0.05. It was observed that two genera Prevotella and 
Anaerovibria are significantly upregulated in BC patients and others are 
downregulated. Functional analysis based on all differential genera identified 
19 MetaCyc signaling pathways, twelve of which were significantly enriched in BC 
patients by containing 165 genes Top-ranked 10 genes mdh, pykF, gapA, zwf, pgi, 
tpiA, pgk, pfkA, ppsA, and pykA were identified as BC-causing bacterial key 
genes (bKGs) through protein-protein interaction network analysis. Subsequently, 
the bKG-guided top ranked 10 drug molecules Digitoxin, Digoxin, Ledipasvir, 
Suramin, Ergotamine, Venetoclax, Nilotinib, Conivaptan, Dihydroergotamine, and 
Elbasvir were identified using molecular docking analysis. The stability of 
top-ranked three drug-target complexes (Digitoxin-pykA, Digoxin-mdh, and 
Ledipasvir-pgi) were confirmed through the molecular dynamics simulation 
studies. Therefore, these findings might be useful resources to the wet-lab 
researchers for further experimental validation on bacterial therapies against 
BC.

Tamoxifen is the most prescribed drug used to prevent breast cancer recurrence, 
but patients show variable responses to tamoxifen. Such differential 
inter-individual response has a significant socioeconomic impact as one in eight 
women will develop breast cancer and nearly half a million people in the United 
States are treated with tamoxifen annually. Tamoxifen is orally delivered and 
must be activated by metabolizing enzymes in the liver; however, clinical 
studies show that neither genotype nor hepatic metabolic enzymes are sufficient 
to predict why some patients have sub-therapeutic levels of the drug. Here, 
using gnotobiotic- and antibiotics-treated mice, we show that tamoxifen 
pharmacokinetics are heavily influenced by gut bacteria and prolonged exposure 
to tamoxifen. Interestingly, 16S rRNA gene sequencing shows tamoxifen does not 
affect overall microbiota composition and abundance. Metabolomics, however, 
reveals differential metabolic profiles across the microbiomes of different 
donors cultured with tamoxifen, suggesting an enzymatic diversity within the gut 
microbiome that influences response to tamoxifen. Consistent with this notion, 
we found that β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes vary in their hydrolysis activity of 
glucuronidated tamoxifen metabolites across the gut microbiomes of people. 
Together, these findings highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in 
tamoxifen's pharmacokinetics.IMPORTANCEOne in eight women will develop breast 
cancer in their lifetime, and tamoxifen is used to suppress breast cancer 
recurrence, but nearly 50% of patients are not effectively treated with this 
drug. Given that tamoxifen is orally administered and, thus, reaches the 
intestine, this variable patient response to the drug is likely related to the 
gut microbiota composed of trillions of bacteria, which are remarkably different 
among individuals. This study aims to understand the impact of the gut 
microbiome on tamoxifen absorption, metabolism, and recycling. The significance 
of our research is in defining the role that gut microbes play in tamoxifen 
pharmacokinetics, thus paving the way for more tailored and effective 
therapeutic interventions in the prevention of breast cancer recurrence.

Lung cancer (LC) continues to pose the highest mortality and exhibits a common 
prevalence among all types of cancer. The genetic interaction between human 
eukaryotes and microbial cells plays a vital role in orchestrating every 
physiological activity of the host. The dynamic crosstalk between gut and lung 
microbiomes and the gut-lung axis communication network has been widely accepted 
as promising factors influencing LC progression. The advent of the 16s rDNA 
sequencing technique has opened new horizons for elucidating the lung microbiome 
and its potential pathophysiological role in LC and other infectious lung 
diseases using a molecular approach. Numerous studies have reported the direct 
involvement of the host microbiome in lung tumorigenesis processes and their 
impact on current treatment strategies such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or 
immunotherapy. The genetic and metabolomic cross-interaction, 
microbiome-dependent host immune modulation, and the close association between 
microbiota composition and treatment outcomes strongly suggest that designing 
microbiome-based treatment strategies and investigating new molecules targeting 
the common holobiome could offer potential alternatives to develop effective 
therapeutic principles for LC treatment. This review aims to highlight the 
interaction between the host and microbiome in LC progression and the 
possibility of manipulating altered microbiome ecology as therapeutic targets.

Exosomes can regulate the malignant progression of tumors by carrying a variety 
of genetic information and transmitting it to target cells. Recent studies 
indicate that exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulate multiple biological 
processes in carcinogenesis, such as tumor growth, metastasis, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, drug resistance, autophagy, metabolism, 
angiogenesis, and immune escape. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), exosomal 
circRNAs can be transferred among tumor cells, endothelial cells, 
cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells, and microbiota, affecting tumor 
initiation and progression. Due to the high stability and widespread presence of 
exosomal circRNAs, they hold promise as biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and 
prognosis prediction in blood and urine. In addition, designing nanoparticles 
targeting exosomal circRNAs and utilizing exosomal circRNAs derived from immune 
cells or stem cells provide new strategies for cancer therapy. In this review, 
we examined the crucial role of exosomal circRNAs in regulating tumor-related 
signaling pathways and summarized the transmission of exosomal circRNAs between 
various types of cells and their impact on the TME. Finally, our review 
highlights the potential of exosomal circRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic 
prediction biomarkers, as well as suggesting new strategies for clinical 
therapy.

Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), poses a significant 
global health challenge due to its high mortality rate. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the two main types of primary 
liver cancer (PLC), each with its own set of complexities. Secondary or 
metastatic liver cancer is more common than PLC. It is frequently observed in 
malignancies such as colorectal, pancreatic, melanoma, lung, and breast cancer. 
Liver cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, making it difficult to 
treat. This highlights the need for focused research on early detection and 
effective treatment strategies. This review explores the epidemiology, risk 
factors, and diagnostic techniques for HCC. The development of HCC involves 
various risk factors, including chronic liver diseases, hepatitis B and C 
infections, alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, and genetic predispositions. 
Various invasive and non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as biopsy, liquid 
biopsy, and imaging modalities like ultrasonography, computed tomography scans 
(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography 
(PET) scans, are utilized for HCC detection and monitoring. Advances in imaging 
technology and biomarker research have led to more accurate and sensitive 
methods for early HCC detection. We also reviewed advanced research on emerging 
techniques, including next-generation sequencing, metabolomics, epigenetic 
biomarkers, and microbiome analysis, which show great potential for advancing 
early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. This literature review 
provides insights into the current state of liver cancer diagnosis and promising 
future advancements. Ongoing research and innovation in these areas are 
essential for improving early diagnosis and reducing the global burden of liver 
cancer.

In recent years, complex interactions between intratumoral bacteria and 
neutrophils have been identified as significant factors in tumor occurrence and 
development. This commentary synthesizes findings from the past five years to 
explore these interactions. It is observed that during tumor progression, 
intratumoral bacteria promote neutrophil infiltration and the formation of 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which in turn drive tumor development and 
metastasis. Conversely, infiltrating neutrophils are also capable of slowing 
tumor progression by limiting the number of intratumoral bacteria. This dual 
role underscores a potential avenue for improving cancer treatment outcomes.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune skin disease characterized by 
keratinocyte hyperproliferation, primarily driven by the IL-23/IL-17 axis. In 
addition to immune response, various skin components, including the epidermal 
barrier and the skin microbiota, have been individually implicated in the 
disease pathogenesis. Here, we aimed to investigate the interplay between 
epidermal tight junctions, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), and CD4 T 
cell-mediated immune responses. By immunofluorescence analyses of skin biopsies, 
we observed that claudin-1 distribution was significantly altered in psoriatic 
patients, which correlated with the localization of Staphylococcus aureus and 
SEB across skin layers and with disease severity. Furthermore, functional CD4 
TCRvβ17 cells were associated with SEB presence in patients skin and positively 
correlated with psoriasis severity. Notably, in patients with SEB detected in 
the dermis, CD4 TCRvβ17 IL-17 cells were linked to barrier abnormalities. 
Unsupervised analysis stratified psoriasis patients into three groups based on 
SEB presence and location, supporting the previous findings. The patient group 
with SEB in the dermis exhibited improved responses to biological therapy, 
including reductions in PASI score, claudin-1 fragmentation, S. aureus and SEB 
presence, and CD4 TCRvβ17 cell percentages. Our findings emphasize the complex 
interplay between epidermal barrier distribution, SEB localization, and 
functional CD4 TCRvβ17 cells in psoriatic skin, highlighting their potential in 
patient stratification in association with the severity of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 is essential for neurological function, red blood cell 
formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency can lead to diverse health conditions, 
including megaloblastic anemia and neurological issues. Oral supplementation is 
a standard treatment for B12 deficiency. The Sucrosomial® carrier system offers 
an innovative approach that enhances supplemental nutrient absorption and 
bioavailability.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of oral Sucrosomial® 
vitamin B12 formulation vs various conventional B12 supplements, randomly 
selected from local pharmacies, in increasing and maintaining circulatory B12 
levels in healthy deficient adults (200-300 pg/mL).
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted across three 
centers in Pakistan from April to July 2024. At KEMU, participants received 
either Sucrosomial® vitamin B12 or Mecogen SL B12; at LRH, Sucrosomial® B12 or 
B-SUB B12; and at LUMHS, Sucrosomial® B12, Evermin B12, or Neuromax B12. 
Participants took a daily single dose of 1,000 μg of the assigned B12 
formulation for 7 days. Serum B12 levels were measured at baseline (day 0) and 
on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.
RESULTS: Sucrosomial® B12 was significantly more effective than conventional B12 
formulations in increasing and maintaining higher serum B12 levels across all 
time points. At KEMU, it reached a peak concentration of 454 ± 3.9 pg/mL by day 
5, compared to 274 ± 11.1 pg/mL with Mecogen SL B12. At LRH, it peaked at 
496 ± 34.4 pg/mL by day 5 versus 304 ± 49.4 pg/mL for B-SUB B12. At LUMHS, it 
reached 592.7 ± 74.3 pg/mL by day 7, compared to 407.24 ± 41.6 pg/mL for Evermin 
B12 and 263.82 ± 23.8 pg/mL for Neuromax B12. Sucrosomial® B12 was the only 
formulation to surpass the deficiency-borderline threshold (200-300 pg/mL) 
within 24 h of the first dose and was well tolerated with no reported side 
effects.
CONCLUSION: Sucrosomial® vitamin B12 demonstrated superior efficacy in rapidly 
and consistently elevating and maintaining higher circulatory B12 levels 
compared to conventional supplements. Its characteristic absorption mode and 
proven efficacy suggest it could effectively address B12 deficiency in a broad 
range of populations, including those with gastrointestinal conditions and 
pernicious anemia, thereby supporting overall health.

This review assesses the current understanding of the relationship between the 
human microbiome and BCa. Recognizing how the microbiome affects the tumor 
microenvironment provides valuable insights into cancer biology, potentially 
uncovering interactions that could be leveraged to develop innovative 
therapeutic approaches. By clarifying these intricate microbial-tumor dynamics, 
novel targets for microbiome-based interventions can be identified, ultimately 
improving treatment effectiveness and patient outcomes. Current literature lacks 
comprehensive insights into the effects of BCa treatment on the microbiome and 
the prevalence of immunotherapy-related toxicities. Further research into the 
microbiome's role in BCa development could bridge the gap between fundamental 
research and therapeutic applications. Implementing microbiome surveillance, 
metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomics in clinical trials could deepen our 
understanding of BCa and its treatment. This review explores the existing 
understanding of the urine, tissue, and gut microbiomes and their connections to 
BCa. Enhanced knowledge of these relationships can pave the way for future 
research to identify reliable disease predictors, prognostic markers, and novel 
therapeutic targets.

Microbiome is a highly complex and diverse symbiotic component that undergoes 
dynamic changes with the organismal aging. Microbial perturbations, termed 
dysbiosis, exert strong influence on dysregulating the bone marrow niche and 
subsequently promoting the aging of hematopoietic and immune system. Besides, 
accumulating studies have revealed the substantial impact of intestinal 
microbiome on the initiation and progression of age-related hematologic 
alteration and diseases, such as clonal hematopoiesis and blood cancers. Current 
therapeutic approaches to restore the altered microbiome diversity target 
specific pathobionts and are demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes of 
anti-hematologic malignancy treatments. In this review, we discuss the interplay 
between the microbiome and the hemato-immune system during aging process. We 
also shed light on the emerging therapeutic strategies to tackle the dysbiosis 
for amelioration of aging and disease progression.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tetradium ruticarpum (A.Juss.) T.G.Hartley is a 
traditional Chinese medicine with a history of thousands of years, which plays 
an important role in the relief of gastric pain, indigestion, vomiting and 
diarrhea. Rutaecarpine (RUT) is one of the major active constituents of 
Tetradium ruticarpum (A.Juss.) T.G.Hartley with potential therapeutic activity 
in chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). However, the mechanism of RUT to improve 
CAG is not well understood.
AIM OF THIS STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of RUT in treating 
CAG and its underlying mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CAG model of SD rats was established by induction 
with 0.1% ammonia and 20 mmol/L sodium deoxycholate solution, accompanied with 
irregular fasting cycle. The efficacy of RUT in treating CAG was assessed 
through pathological examination and serum biochemical indices including PP, 
IL-6, MTL, TNF-α, PG I, SS, PG II, IL-10 and GAS-17. Following this, network 
pharmacology, 16s rRNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and broadly targeted 
metabolomics were conducted to unravel the underlying mechanisms of RUT's action 
in CAG treatment. Ultimately, molecular docking, western blotting, and 
immunohistochemistry were employed to validate the critical targets and pathways 
involved in RUT's therapeutic approach for CAG.
RESULTS: RUT significantly improved body weight, gastric juice pH and gastric 
histologic injury in CAG rats. The results of serum biochemical indices showed 
that RUT significantly inhibited the expression levels of SS, GAS-17, IL-6 and 
TNF-α, and increased the levels of MTL, PP, PGI, PGII and IL-10. In addition, 
RUT apparently increased the expression of mucosal barrier proteins such as 
ZO-1, E-cadherin and claudin-4 and occludin. Network pharmacology in combination 
with transcriptomics revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway was the most 
important pathway for RUT treatment of CAG. Further analysis suggested that by 
regulating linoleic acid metabolism, metabolic pathways, etc. mainly related to 
energy metabolism, RUT intervention effectively ameliorated gastric tissue 
metabolic disorders in CAG rats. The 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis 
revealed that RUT altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota and 
decreased the relative abundance of unclassified_Muribaculaceae. PICRUST 
analysis suggested that the differential bacteria may be involved in energy 
metabolism pathway regulation for the improvement of CAG. A comprehensive 
analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome showed that the RUT improved the 
differential metabolites through the regulation of TGER2, CBR1 and CTPS1 
targets.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that RUT's mechanism of action in treating 
CAG was related to modulating the gut microbiota, influencing energy metabolism, 
and inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway. This provided new insights into how 
RUT exerts its therapeutic effects on CAG.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) encompasses a 
spectrum of liver lesions, ranging from simple steatosis to metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), that may further progress to 
cirrhosis. MASLD is estimated to affect more than one third of the general 
population and it represents a risk factor for end-stage liver failure and liver 
cancer, substantially contributing to liver-related morbidity and mortality. 
Although the pathogenesis of MASLD is incompletely understood, it is known to 
consist of a multifactorial process influenced by extrinsic and intrinsic 
factors such as metabolic, environmental and demographic features, gut 
microbiota and genetics. Dysregulation of both extracellular and intracellular 
lipid composition is known to promote the generation of toxic lipid species, 
thereby triggering lipotoxicity and cellular stress. These events ultimately 
lead to the activation of distinct cell death pathways, resulting in 
inflammation, fibrogenesis and, eventually, carcinogenesis. In this manuscript, 
we provide a comprehensive review of the role of lipotoxicity during MASLD 
pathogenesis, discussing the most relevant lipid species and related molecular 
mechanisms, summarizing the cell type-specific effects and highlighting the most 
promising putative therapeutic strategies for modulating lipotoxicity and lipid 
metabolism in MASLD.

Dysbiosis of the gut-liver axis increases the risk of bacterial and metabolite 
influx into the liver, which may contribute to the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we compared the microbiomes in HCC tumors and 
adjacent tissues. We examined the HCC tumors and adjacent tissues from 19 
patients diagnosed with HCC. We find that the liver tissues from HCC patients 
with capsule invasion presented higher alpha diversity at the genus level than 
those without. The bacterial compositions in liver tissues of HCC patients at 
stage II differed from those at stage I and Advanced, respectively. Metagenomic 
profiling revealed that order Actinomycetales was enriched in the HCC patients 
at advanced stages. Order Lactobacillales, family Veillonellaceae, genera 
Rhodobacter and Megasphaera are enriched in tumors of HCC patients, whereas 
genus Pseudochrobactrum is enriched in the adjacent tissues from HCC patients. 
An increased abundance of class Actinobacteria and order Actinomycetales is 
observed in the HCC patients with cirrhosis. In contrast, phylum Firmicutes, 
classes Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria, and order Clostridiales are enriched 
in those without cirrhosis. The presence of various types of bacterial 16S rRNAs 
in HCC tumors and adjacent tissues indicates the presence of various bacterial 
communities therein. Our study provides information about differentially 
abundant intrahepatic bacteria in patients with HCC. The differences found may 
support possible diagnostic and personalized therapeutic implications for HCC.

The gut microbiota is a highly complex microbial community residing in the 
digestive tract of humans and animals, closely linked to host health. Dysbiosis 
within the gut microbiota has been associated with various diseases. Moreover, 
it interacts with the female reproductive system's microbiota, influencing 
maternal reproductive homeostasis. Although the gut microbiota holds potential 
for treating reproductive system diseases and modulating offspring fertility, 
research in this domain remains limited. This review examines the relationship 
between both balanced and imbalanced gut microbiota and reproductive system 
diseases, as well as their effects on fetal development. It is highlighted that 
dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may contribute to several reproductive 
conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), preeclampsia (PE), 
endometriosis, gestational diabetes, and reproductive cancers. The abundance of 
specific gut microbial species or interactions among various species can 
influence the reproductive system through hormonal pathways and other 
mechanisms, ultimately affecting pregnancy outcomes and fetal health. Therefore, 
the concept of the gut-reproductive axis is proposed, emphasizing the 
significant role of maternal gut microbiota in shaping fetal development, 
metabolic capacity, and immunity.

BACKGROUND: Disturbances in the gut microbiota may act as mechanisms influencing 
the interplay between dietary factors and metabolic disorders. Studies have 
demonstrated that these alterations are associated with the diagnosis of 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Within this context, we aimed to investigate 
associations between gut microbiota, gut-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty 
acids [SCFAs] and indole-3-propionic acid [IPA]), and dietary intake in women 
with PCOS.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 24 women with PCOS, previously 
recruited for two studies at our research center, compared with 14 age-matched 
healthy controls. The mean (SD) age of all 38 participants was 33.3 (7.5) years, 
and the mean (SD) body mass index was 29.5 (4.8) kg/m2. Primary outcomes 
included gut microbiota analysis by sequencing the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA 
gene, serum IPA levels measured by liquid chromatography/triple-quadrupole mass 
spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS), and fecal and plasma SCFA levels measured by LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Gut microbiota diversity, composition, and metabolic pathways differed 
between the PCOS and control groups. A higher abundance of two operational 
taxonomic units specializing in complex carbohydrate metabolism was observed in 
healthy control women. The PCOS group exhibited a less favorable dietary intake 
than the control group, and a significant correlation was observed between gut 
microbiota composition and dietary glycemic load in PCOS (r = 0.314, P = 0.03 in 
Mantel test). Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models indicated that 
lower levels of IPA and higher circulating levels of two SCFAs (acetic acid and 
propionic acid) were independently associated with the diagnosis of PCOS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the differentiation between women with PCOS and 
healthy controls based on gut microbiota analysis. Furthermore, changes in gut 
bacteria and their metabolites could be, at least in part, the biological 
mechanism by which a low glycemic load diet may potentially improve PCOS-related 
reproductive and cardiometabolic outcomes.

Cushing's syndrome is caused by an elevation of endogenous or pharmacologically 
administered glucocorticoids. Acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP, encoded by 
the gene diazepam binding inhibitor, Dbi) stimulates food intake and 
lipo-anabolic reactions. Here we found that plasma ACBP/DBI concentrations were 
elevated in patients and mice with Cushing's syndrome. We used several methods 
for ACBP/DBI inhibition in mice, namely, (1) induction of ACBP/DBI 
autoantibodies, (2) injection of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, (3) 
body-wide or hepatocyte-specific knockout of the Dbi gene, (4) mutation of the 
ACBP/DBI receptor Gabrg2 and (5) injections of triiodothyronine or (6) the 
thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist resmetirom to block Dbi transcription. These 
six approaches abolished manifestations of Cushing's syndrome such as increased 
food intake, weight gain, excessive adiposity, liver damage, 
hypertriglyceridaemia and type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, it appears that 
ACBP/DBI constitutes an actionable target that is causally involved in the 
development of Cushing's syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common human 
sarcoma with over 5000 new patients diagnosed in the USA each year. The tumor 
originates from the interstitial cells of Cajal and forms an intramural lesion 
most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The gut microbiome has been 
linked to other gastrointestinal cancers and a recent paper purported that GISTs 
contain substantial intratumoral bacteria. The purpose of this study is to 
further evaluate the presence of bacteria in GISTs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 25 tumor samples of varying size and location 
from 24 patients under sterile conditions in the operating room immediately 
following surgical resection. 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing were performed to evaluate 
the bacterial species present in each tumor. Retrospective chart review was 
performed to determine tumor characteristics, including tumor size, location, 
imatinib exposure, and mucosal involvement.
RESULTS: In 23 of the 25 tumor samples, there were fewer than 100 copy numbers 
of 16S rRNA per uL, indicating an absence of a significant bacterial load. 16S 
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the remaining two samples, one gastric tumor 
and one duodenal tumor, revealed the presence of normal intestinal bacteria. 
These two tumors, along with three others, had disruption of the mucosal lining.
CONCLUSIONS: GISTs generally lack substantial bacteria, except in some cases 
when the tumor disrupts the mucosa.

Metabolic syndrome, as a complex pathological condition, is caused by a series 
of pathogenic factors and has become a global public health challenge. 
Anthocyanins, a natural water-soluble flavonoid pigment, have attracted much 
attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer biological 
activities. After ingestion, a majority of anthocyanins is not directly absorbed 
but rather reaches the colon. Hence, the exertion of their biological benefits 
is closely intertwined with the role played by gut microbiota. In this review, 
we introduce the pathogenesis and intervention methods of metabolic syndrome, as 
well as the interaction between anthocyanins and gut microbiota. We also discuss 
the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins through gut microbiota in addressing a 
range of metabolic syndrome conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 
inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, osteoporosis, and cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact cancer outcomes. The CDC 
Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) integrates scores for four neighborhood-based 
SDOH domains (socioeconomic status, household characteristics, minority status, 
and housing type/transportation) to assess neighborhood social vulnerability 
(NSV). While NSV has been associated with overall cancer mortality and lung, 
breast, colon, and endometrial cancer-specific mortality, the relationship 
between NSV as defined by the SVI and ovarian cancer outcomes remains unknown.
METHODS: We used data from 177 patients enrolled in an observational ovarian 
cancer cohort study from October 2012 through September 2022. All patients 
underwent debulking surgery and completed an entire course of standard-of-care 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Follow-up was completed through May 2024. SVI was 
calculated using census tract at diagnosis. High NSV was defined as SVI in the 
top quartile of the cohort. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the 
association between NSV and progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival.
RESULTS: After accounting for demographic and clinical factors, high NSV was 
associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.31 [95% CI:1.48-3.61]; P < 0.001) 
and OS (HR:1.79 [95% CI:1.10-2.92]; P = 0.02), with neighborhood socioeconomic 
status associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.29 [95% CI:1.47-3.56]; 
P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.71 [95% CI:1.04-2.80]; P = 0.03). Neighborhood housing 
type/transportation was also associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:1.65 
[95% CI:1.07-2.55]; P = 0.02) and trended towards worse OS (HR:1.43 [95% CI: 
0.80-2.33]).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Higher neighborhood social vulnerability is associated 
with worse outcomes among ovarian cancer patients. Validating these results in a 
population-based cohort and assessing programs to reduce neighborhood social 
vulnerability to improve ovarian cancer outcomes is warranted.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare condition 
following SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with intestinal manifestations. 
Genetic predisposition, including inborn errors of the OAS-RNAseL pathway, has 
been reported. We sequenced 154 MIS-C patients and utilized a novel statistical 
framework of gene burden analysis, "burdenMC," which identified an enrichment 
for rare predicted-deleterious variants in BTNL8 (OR = 4.2, 95% CI: 3.5-5.3, P < 
10-6). BTNL8 encodes an intestinal epithelial regulator of Vγ4+γδ T cells 
implicated in regulating gut homeostasis. Enrichment was exclusive to MIS-C, 
being absent in patients with COVID-19 or bacterial disease. Using an available 
functional test for BTNL8, rare variants from a larger cohort of MIS-C patients 
(n = 835) were tested which identified eight variants in 18 patients (2.2%) with 
impaired engagement of Vγ4+γδ T cells. Most of these variants were in the B30.2 
domain of BTNL8 implicated in sensing epithelial cell status. These findings 
were associated with altered intestinal permeability, suggesting a possible link 
between disrupted gut homeostasis and MIS-C-associated enteropathy triggered by 
SARS-CoV-2.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with an 
extremely poor prognosis. The most common complications after a 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) include surgical site infection (SSI), 
postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), and delayed gastric emptying (DGE). The 
potential role and mechanisms of microbial colonization of key surgical sites 
resulting in perioperative complications after PD remain to be fully elucidated. 
In this key paper evaluation, the role of different microbiota in perioperative 
morbidity and mortality following PD are discussed, and key microbial signatures 
are identified that may shape the future management of post-operative surgical 
care.

BACKGROUND: Irinotecan is a chemotherapeutic drug widely used to treat solid 
tumors. However, its effectiveness is limited by the severely delayed onset of 
diarrhea. This study aimed to confirm the protective effects of the non-systemic 
oral antibiotic rifaximin on irinotecan-induced mucositis in mice model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six to eight week-old BALB/c mice were treated with 
saline, irinotecan (50 mg/kg, i.p. once daily), rifaximin (50 mg/kg, p.o. twice 
daily), or irinotecan + rifaximin for 9 consecutive days. Signs of diarrhea, 
bloody diarrhea, and body weight were monitored daily. Intestinal tissues were 
harvested for histopathological analysis and quantitative PCR. SN38 and SN38G 
concentration in intestine were detected using LC-MS analysis. Intestinal 
bacteria β-glucuronidase (BGUS) activity was detected using mouse feces. We 
performed 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the gut microbiota composition. Gut 
permeability was tested in vivo by measuring the fluorescein 
isothiocyanate-dextran intensity in the serum.
RESULTS: Rifaximin reduced the frequency of delayed diarrhea and attenuated the 
severity of diarrhea caused by irinotecan in mice. Rifaximin significantly 
inhibited SN38 exposure in intestine and irinotecan-induced increase in BGUS 
activity. Rifaximin alleviated intestinal mucosal inflammation, prevented 
intestinal epithelial damage caused by irinotecan, and maintained gut barrier 
function. Moreover, the consecutive use of rifaximin did not cause a disorder in 
gut microbiota and reduced irinotecan-induced Firmicutes expansion. More 
importantly, rifaximin inhibited the expansion of some microbiota (such as 
Blautia, Eggerthella, and f_Enterobacteriaceae) and promoted an increase in 
beneficial microbiota (such as Lactobacillus intestinalis, Lachnospiraceae 
NK4A136 group, and f_Oscillospiraceae).
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive use of rifaximin is a feasible method to protect against 
irinotecan-induced diarrhea.
