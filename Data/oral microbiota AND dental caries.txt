Dental caries is a global oral health issue that is prevalent and preventable. 
Biotics (probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and postbiotics) are recommended as 
low-cost methods for preventing dental caries. This scoping review aimed to 
critically review the scientific evidence concerning the role of biotics in 
caries prevention and maintaining oral health benefits. A systematic search was 
conducted in several databases from 2012 onward, using specific keywords. The 
search resulted in 69 articles. While there is limited research on the mechanism 
of biotics in preventing caries, numerous studies have investigated the impacts 
of probiotics on decreasing caries risk factors. Probiotics can reduce 
cariogenic bacteria, reduce acidogenic bacteria, increase pH, and produce 
antimicrobial compounds. Probiotics can be used as a therapeutic approach to 
manage caries by restoring eubiosis at the host-microbial interface, which may 
not be accomplished with traditional therapies. Its positive effect on reducing 
dental caries is influenced by the choice of potent probiotic strains, 
appropriate dosage, treatment period, vehicle, and microbial interaction with 
the host. Specific oral bacteria have also been shown to utilize prebiotics such 
as urea and arginine, increasing pH levels. This highlights the potential of 
combining prebiotic and probiotic bacteria for caries prevention. In addition, 
this review is focused on bacterial-derived compounds, namely postbiotics, due 
to their valuable effects in preventing caries. Biotics have demonstrated 
potential in preventing dental caries and maintaining oral health. Further 
research is needed to optimize their use and explore the potential of 
postbiotics for caries prevention.

The oral microbiome, comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa, is 
essential for maintaining both oral and systemic health. This complex ecosystem 
includes over 700 bacterial species, such as Streptococcus mutans, which 
contributes to dental caries through acid production that demineralizes tooth 
enamel. Fungi like Candida and pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are 
also significant, as they can lead to periodontal diseases through inflammation 
and destruction of tooth-supporting structures. Dysbiosis, or microbial 
imbalance, is a key factor in the development of these oral diseases. 
Understanding the composition and functions of the oral microbiome is vital for 
creating targeted therapies for these conditions. Additionally, the kynurenine 
pathway, which processes the amino acid tryptophan, plays a crucial role in 
immune regulation, neuroprotection, and inflammation. Oral bacteria can 
metabolize tryptophan, influencing the production of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 
and quinolinic acid, thereby affecting the kynurenine system. The balance of 
microbial species in the oral cavity can impact tryptophan levels and its 
metabolites. This narrative review aims to explore the relationship between the 
oral microbiome, oral diseases, and the kynurenine system in relation to certain 
systemic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: This study used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to examine the 
impact of long-term continuous fluoride treatment on the dental plaque 
microbiota of children aged 8 to 9 with mixed dentition.
DESIGN: The study population consisted of twenty 8-9-year-old children with 
dental caries. Topical application of fluoride-varnish was weekly administered 
for one month to all subjects. Clinical indicators and anthropological data, 
such as the caries index (DMFT and dmft), were documented for every participant 
at baseline. A baseline assessment and a month after the fluoride varnish 
treatment were conducted for the salivary pH level and the 
Patient-Hygiene-Performance (PHP) index. Following application of the fluoride 
varnish, plaque samples were obtained both one month later and before (baseline) 
and were then used for 16S rRNA gene-based Next Generation Sequencing.
RESULTS: The results showed significant differences in the community composition 
structure (p < 0.01). Notable caries-associated pathogens in the dental plaque 
microbiome were depleted whilst health associated phylum Proteobacteria was 
increased in the abundance following fluoride-varnish application. In children 
with mixed dentition, this study found that after one month of fluoride-varnish 
treatment, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of the dominant 
pathogenic genera, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Capnocytophaga, Neisseria, and 
Leptrotrichia, along with an increase in certain genera related to healthy oral 
condition, mostly from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Areinmonas, 
Pseudoxanthomonas, and Luteimonas.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoride-varnish application may shift the community level 
microecology from dysbiosis to eubiosis. Moreover, application of 
fluoride-varnish with weekly intervals for one month reduced the caries-causing 
bacteria while enriching the rise of unique, ubiquitous genera primarily 
belonging to the Proteobacteria, which may plaque a defensive role against 
progression of caries. Furthermore, a rising pH level towards neutrality (pH 7) 
indicated a healthier oral environment following the application of fluoride 
varnish.

BACKGROUND: Systemic alterations in the oral cavity can be reflected in skin 
disorders like psoriasis. However, data about oral health factors that are 
affected and controlled mainly by oral microbiota in atopic dermatitis (AD) are 
sparse. This study compared the oral status and oral microbiota of AD patients 
and healthy controls.
METHODS: This was a prospective sex- and age-matched case-control study 
comparing adult participants with and without dermatologist-verified AD. A 
dentist assessed oral health status, and oral flora samples were collected and 
subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-five AD participants and 41 non-AD controls were recruited. 
Compared to the participants in the control group, those with AD had 
significantly higher plaque levels (P = .04), poorer oral hygiene indices (P = 
.04), and higher gingival index trends (P = .05). The oral microbiome in the AD 
group showed significantly higher diversity, both in α and β diversities (P = 
.001, P = .0007, respectively). Furthermore, AD patients had a significantly 
increased abundance of taxa correlated with oral diseases and a decreased 
abundance of bacteria associated with a healthy oral status.
CONCLUSION: AD appears to be associated with poor oral health and oral 
dysbiosis. There is a need to increase both patients' and physicians' awareness 
of oral health.

MOTIVATION: Microbiome differential abundance analysis (DAA) remains a 
challenging problem despite multiple methods proposed in the literature. The 
excessive zeros and compositionality of metagenomics data are two main 
challenges for DAA.
RESULTS: We propose a novel method called "Analysis of Microbiome Differential 
Abundance by Pooling Tobit Models" (ADAPT) to overcome these two challenges. 
ADAPT interprets zero counts as left-censored observations to avoid unfounded 
assumptions and complex models. ADAPT also encompasses a theoretically justified 
way of selecting non-differentially abundant microbiome taxa as a reference to 
reveal differentially abundant taxa while avoiding false discoveries. We 
generate synthetic data using independent simulation frameworks to show that 
ADAPT has more consistent false discovery rate control and higher statistical 
power than competitors. We use ADAPT to analyze 16S rRNA sequencing of saliva 
samples and shotgun metagenomics sequencing of plaque samples collected from 
infants in the COHRA2 study. The results provide novel insights into the 
association between the oral microbiome and early childhood dental caries.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package ADAPT can be installed from 
Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADAPT.html 
or from Github at https://github.com/mkbwang/ADAPT. The source codes for

BACKGROUND: Probiotics serve as a novel preventive or therapeutic approach for 
dental caries owing to their ability to reverse dysbiosis and restore a healthy 
microbiota. Here, we identified Burkholderia ambifaria AFS098024 as a probiotic 
candidate isolated from plants.
METHODS: The safety of B. ambifaria was evaluated by hemolytic activity, 
D-lactic acid production and antibiotic susceptibility. In vitro biofilm model 
derived from the saliva of caries-free and caries-active donors and in vivo rat 
caries model were used to assess the efficacy of B. ambifaria in caries 
prevention and treatment.
RESULTS: B. ambifaria was safe as a probiotic candidate and it could integrate 
with in vitro biofilm model. It significantly reduced the biomass and lactate 
production of biofilms from caries-active donors and disrupted biofilm 
structures. B. ambifaria effectively reduced the severity of carious lesions in 
rat molars, regardless of the inoculation sequence. Molars pretreated or treated 
with B. ambifaria demonstrated notably higher enamel volumes. Additionally, 
colonization of rat molars by B. ambifaria persisted for 6 weeks.
CONCLUSION: The B. ambifaria strain used in this study holds promise as a 
probiotic for inhibiting dental caries, both in vitro and in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the anticariogenic effects of resin cement 
containing varying ursolic acid (UA) concentrations and to determine the optimal 
UA concentrations in the microcosm biofilm model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental resin cements with UA concentrations of 0, 
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% were prepared. Class I cavities were prepared on 50 
extracted human molars and restored with composite inlays and experimental resin 
cements. Tooth samples were subjected to artificial caries induction for 10 days 
in a microcosm biofilm model using human saliva as an inoculum, and then mineral 
changes were evaluated using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (ΔF and ΔQ) 
and micro-computed tomography (CT). The bacterial composition of the human 
saliva was analyzed by 16 s RNA microbiome profiling. One-way analysis of 
variance with Tukey and Duncan post-hoc tests was employed for statistical 
analysis (p < 0.05).
RESULTS: As the UA concentration increased, resin cement decreased ΔF and ΔQ 
before and after caries induction but showed a significant difference only in ΔQ 
at UA concentration ≥ 1.0 % (p < 0.05). The gray value analysis result of micro 
CT also showed a significant difference at UA concentration ≥ 1.0 % (p < 0.05). 
In the human saliva analysis, bacterial composition remained within normal oral 
microbiota ranges.
CONCLUSION: Resin cements containing at least 1.0 % of UA exhibited an 
anticariogenic effect on dental microcosm biofilms.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To reduce the failure of restorations, it is essential to 
prevent the occurrence of secondary caries. The application of UA in resin 
cement can be utilized to prevent the formation of secondary caries due to the 
anticariogenic effect of UA.

Background: Human breast milk is a valuable source of potential probiotic 
candidates. The bacteria isolated from human breast milk play an important role 
in the development of the infant gut microbiota, exhibiting diverse biological 
functions. Methods: In this study, Limosilactobacillus reuteri MBHC 10138 
isolated from breast milk was characterized in terms of its probiotic safety 
characteristics and potential efficacy in hyperuricemia, obesity, lipid liver, 
and dental caries, conditions which Korean consumers seek to manage using 
probiotics. Results: Strain MBHC 10138 demonstrated a lack of D-lactate and 
biogenic amine production as well as a lack of bile salt deconjugation and 
hemolytic activity. It also exhibited susceptibility to common antibiotics, 
tolerance to simulated oral-gastric-intestinal conditions, and superior 
biological activity compared to three L. reuteri reference strains, including 
KACC 11452 and MJ-1, isolated from feces, and a commercial strain isolated from 
human breast milk. Notably, L. reuteri MBHC 10138 showed high capabilities in 
assimilating guanosine (69.48%), inosine (81.92%), and adenosine (95.8%), 
strongly inhibited 92.74% of biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, and 
reduced lipid accumulation by 32% in HepG2 cells. Conclusions: These findings 
suggest that strain MBHC 10138, isolated from human breast milk, has potential 
to be developed as a probiotic for managing hyperuricemia, obesity, and dental 
caries after appropriate in vivo studies.

BACKGROUND: This prospective study aims to investigate the comparative effects 
of clear aligners (CA) and traditional removable appliances (RA) on the 
cariogenic risk of patients in mixed dentition, focusing on the oral microbiome.
METHODS: 25 children were included and assigned into CA and RA groups. 
Supragingival plaque and saliva samples were collected, and clinical parameters 
including Decay-missing-filled teeth index (DMFT), Plaque Index (PI) and 
Gorelick Index (GI) were recorded before treatment (T0) and after 6-month 
follow-up (T1). DNA was extracted from supragingival plaque and saliva and 
analyzed via 16S rDNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: Clinical parameters showed no statistically significant difference 
between groups at each time point or within group over time (p > 0.05). In both 
RA and CA groups, saliva exhibited significantly higher alpha diversity compared 
to supragingival plaque at T1, as indicated by the significantly higher Chao1 
and Shannon indexes (p < 0.05). Regarding beta diversity, significant difference 
was observed in saliva and supragingival plaque samples between T0 and T1 within 
group RA (p < 0.05, Adonis), whereas no such significance was noted in the CA 
group (p > 0.05, Adonis). At the genus level, Lactobacillus exhibited a 
statistically significant increase in saliva and supragingival plaque of group 
RA from T0 to T1 (p < 0.05), and an increasing trend in the group CA without 
statistical significance (p > 0.05). At T1, Lactobacillus levels were comparable 
between groups, whereas species-level analysis revealed distinct cariogenic 
species.
CONCLUSION: Both clear aligners and traditional removable appliances resulted in 
elevated cariogenic risk of patients in mixed dentition at the microbial level. 
Distinct alterations in cariogenic species were observed to be induced by 
various orthodontic appliances.

Baghdad. Iraq.

OBJECTIVE: To compare caries-related microorganisms and candida in complete 
cleft infants with normal palate infants.
METHODS: The case-control study was conducted from April 2021 to January 2022 at 
the College of Dentistry, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq, and comprised 
infants with age ranging from 1 day to 4 months. They were divided into complete 
cleft group A and control group B. Group A was subdivided into those with class 
III Veau's palatal classification, and the rest with class IV Veau's palatal 
classification. Samples were taken using oral swab which were subjected to 
colony morphology, gram staining and biochemical testing. Data was analysed 
using SPSS 21.
RESULTS: Of the 52 subjects, 26(50%) were in each of the 2 groups. The subgroups 
of group A had 13(50%) patients each. The counting and colonisation of 
streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli and candida albicans were significantly 
higher in group A than in group B (p<0.05). The difference between the subgroups 
of group A was not significant (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Infants with cleft palate were more susceptible to dental caries 
and oral infection than those with normal palate.

Recent advancements in sensory research have brought to light the intricate 
relationship between taste perception and the oral microbiota, prompting 
investigations into their influence on human health, particularly in the context 
of dietary preferences and obesity. This review aims to update the current 
understanding of how oral microbiota influence taste perception and dietary 
choices, elucidating shared metabolic pathways between food processing and oral 
bacteria. Further, this review outlines the mechanisms underlying taste 
perception, emphasising the role of taste receptors and taste buds in shaping 
sensory experiences influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Notably, we 
explore the bidirectional relationship between oral microbiota and taste 
sensitivity, highlighting the potential impact of microbial composition on taste 
perception thresholds and implications for dietary habits and health outcomes, 
such as obesity and dental caries. However, significant research gaps remain, 
particularly in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking oral 
microbiota with taste sensitivity, as well as the long-term effects of 
microbiota-targeted interventions. Future research should focus on longitudinal 
studies and experimental interventions to explore these connections more deeply, 
offering insights into potential strategies for promoting healthier dietary 
behaviours and managing diet-related non-communicable diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze if the microbiome community composition in primary 
endodontic infections is associated with clinical or radiographic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients with primary endodontic infections 
were evaluated for percussion tenderness, presence of a sinus tract, presence of 
caries, sex, probing depth > 4 mm, and age. Samples from the root canals were 
obtained and the microbiome was subsequently characterized by 16 S rRNA amplicon 
sequencing. For the radiographic analysis, a subset of 12 samples with a 
periapical index (PAI) ≤ 2 were compared with 19 samples with PAI of 5. The 
Shannon and Chao1 indices were used to measure alpha diversity. Differences in 
abundances of genera were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test with 
Bonferroni's correction. Differences in community composition were evaluated 
using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices.
RESULTS: No significant differences in microbiome composition relative to 
clinical factors were found using ANOSIM. Teeth within the two categories of 
periapical index showed a similar number of species richness, and alpha 
diversity values P > 0.05. Community composition was significantly affected by 
the periapical index (ANOSIM P = 0.039, R = 0.10). Larger radiographic lesions 
demonstrated significant increase in Prevotellaceae, Olsenella, and the motile 
bacteria Oribacterium, Selenomonadaceae spp., and Treponema.
CONCLUSION: Clinical factors associated with apical periodontitis have a limited 
impact on the root canal microbiome composition. Community composition appears 
to be affected in teeth with large apical lesions.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Dental plaque is the main cause leading to the dental caries 
and periodontal diseases. The main purpose of this study was to test the 
efficacy of oral spray containing the antimicrobial peptide P-113 on the 
reduction of oral bacteria number and dental plaque formation in a randomized 
clinical assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was divided into two parts. In Part A, we 
investigated the user experiences with the P-113 containing oral spray. In part 
B, 14 subjects in the experimental group used the P-113-containing oral spray, 
while 14 subjects in the control group used a placebo without the P-113 in a 
4-week clinical trial. Participants were asked to use the P-113-containing oral 
spray or placebo 3 times per day and 5 times per use. Moreover, 3 check-ups and 
2 washouts were carried out to evaluate the DMFT score, dental plaque weight, 
dental plaque index, and gingival index.
RESULTS: In part A, up to 91.8% of the subjects in the experimental group were 
satisfied with the use of the P-113-containing oral spray. In part B, based on 
our PacBio SMRT sequencing platform and DADA2 analysis, the numbers of 
Streptococcus and Porphyromonas in the experimental group were lower than those 
in the control group. In addition, decreased dental plaque weight, dental plaque 
index, and gingival index were all observed in the experimental group.
CONCLUSION: The P-113-containing oral spray has the potential to reduce the 
dental caries and periodontal disease-related bacteria and to control the dental 
plaque formation.

Adult severe caries (ASC) brings severe oral dysfunction and treatment 
difficulties to patients, and yet no clear pathogenic mechanism for it has been 
found. This study is focused on the composition of dental plaque microbiome 
profiles in order to identify disease-relevant species and to investigate into 
their interactions with the S. mutans. Samples of dental plaque were collected 
for metagenomic analysis. The acidification, aciduricity, oxidative stress 
tolerance, and gtf (glucosyltransferase) gene expression of S. mutans cocultured 
with V. parvula which was identified as ASC-related dominant bacterium. The 
bioﬁlm formation and extracellular exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis of 
dual-strain were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), crystal 
violet (CV) staining, live/dead bacterial staining, and confocal laser scanning 
microscopy (CLSM). Furthermore, rodent model experiments were performed to 
validate the in vivo cariogenicity of the dual-species biofilm. The most 
significantly abundant taxon found associated with ASC was V. parvula. In vitro 
experiments found that V. parvula can effectively promote S. mutans mature 
biofilm formation with enhanced acid resistance, hydrogen peroxide detoxicity, 
and biofilm virulence. Rodent model experiments revealed that V. parvula was 
incapable of causing disease on its own, but it significantly heightened the 
biofilm virulence of S. mutans when being co-infected and augmented the 
progression, quantity, and severity of dental caries. Our findings demonstrated 
that V. parvula may act as a synergistic pathobiont to modulate the metabolic 
activity, spatial structure, and pathogenicity of biofilms of S. mutans in the 
context of ASC.IMPORTANCEAdult severe caries (ASC), as a special type of acute 
caries, is rarely reported and its worthiness of further study is still in 
dispute. Yet studies on the etiology of severe caries in adults have not found a 
clear pathogenic mechanism for it. Knowledge of the oral microbiota is important 
for the treatment of dental caries. We discovered that the interaction between 
V. parvula and S. mutans augments the severity of dental caries in vivo, 
suggesting V. parvula may act as a synergistic pathobiont exacerbating biofilm 
virulence of S. mutans in ASC. Our findings may improve the understanding of ASC 
pathogenesis and are likely to provide a basis for planning appropriate 
therapeutic strategies.

The human body is colonized by trillions of microorganisms in a symbiotic 
relationship. The oral cavity represents one of the most abundant microbial 
habitats in our body. Advances in sequencing techniques provide a more detailed 
understanding of the oral microbiota and how imbalances between bacteria, the 
phenomenon of dysbiosis, can affect not only the development of dental caries or 
inflammation within the oral cavity but also systemic diseases and cancers in 
distant locations. This narrative review evaluates the relationship between oral 
microbiota and its impact on gastrointestinal cancers. Using the keywords "oral 
microbiota 'AND' gastrointestinal cancers", the PubMed Web of Science and Scopus 
databases were searched for articles published between 2014 and 2024. Based on 
the review, the relationship between oral microbiota and oral, esophageal, 
gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, and pancreatic cancers was described. 
Potential oncogenic mechanisms exploited by the microbiota such as the 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induction of abnormal immune 
responses, and disruption of cell metabolic pathways were assessed. Further 
research and a thorough understanding of the impact of the oral microbiota on 
the development of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract may play a key role in 
their prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in the future.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review investigates the oral microbiome's composition, 
functions, influencing factors, connections to oral and systemic diseases, and 
personalized oral care strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: The oral microbiome is a complex ecosystem consisting of 
bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses that contribute to oral health. Various 
factors, such as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, lifestyle choices, and 
medical conditions, can affect the balance of the oral microbiome and lead to 
dysbiosis, which can result in oral health issues like dental caries, 
gingivitis, periodontitis, oral candidiasis, and halitosis. Importantly, our 
review explores novel associations between the oral microbiome and systemic 
diseases including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrinal, and 
neurological conditions, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. We comprehensively 
review the efficacy of interventions like dental probiotics, xylitol, oral 
rinses, fluoride, essential oils, oil pulling, and peptides in promoting oral 
health by modulating the oral microbiome.
SUMMARY: This review emphasizes the critical functions of the oral microbiota in 
dental and overall health, providing insights into the effects of microbial 
imbalances on various diseases. It underlines the significant connection between 
the oral microbiota and general health. Furthermore, it explores the advantages 
of probiotics and other dental care ingredients in promoting oral health and 
addressing common oral issues, offering a comprehensive strategy for 
personalized oral care.

BACKGROUND: Early childhood caries (ECC) are a prevalent chronic disease in 
young children. However, there has been limited research on the microbiota in 
different tissue levels of the same tooth in children with ECC. This study aimed 
to investigate the dynamic changes in bacterial diversity during the progression 
of Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) within the same tooth, from the tooth 
surface to the root canal, by collecting tissue samples from different areas of 
the affected tooth.
METHODS: Twenty primary teeth with periapical periodontitis were selected from 
20 children aged 3-5 years, with 100 samples collected from the different 
layers: uncavitated buccal enamel surface without white spot lesion (surface), 
the outermost layer of the dentin carious lesion (superficial), the inner layer 
of carious dentin (deep), necrotic pulp tissue (pulp), and root exudate 
(exudate). The taxonomy of each OTU representative sequence was analyzed against 
the 16S rRNA database. Comparisons of alpha diversity between groups were 
performed. The number of shared and unique genera between groups counted. Beta 
diversity was contrasted to evaluate differences in bacterial community 
composition, and the relationships between the microbiota and samples were 
analyzed. The heatmap analysis of the 30 most abundant genera was used, which 
highlighted their relative distribution and abundance. The significantly 
abundant taxa (phylum to genera) of bacteria among the different groups were 
identified. The differences of relative abundance between bacterial genera among 
the five groups were analyzed. Significant Spearman correlations were noted, and 
visualization of the co-occurrence network was conducted.
RESULTS: Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that most genera were present 
in all layers, with the number of shared genera increasing as the disease 
advanced. The bacterial communities and core genera in the co-occurrence network 
changed with progression to severe ECC.
CONCLUSION: An increase in both the quantity and complexity of bacterial 
interactions was observed. This study emphasized the importance of paying 
attention to the relationship between microbial species rather than just 
checking changes in bacterial species structure when investigating the role of 
bacteria in disease progression.

Globally, early childhood caries (ECC) is a significant public health concern, 
necessitating effective prediction and prevention strategies. This study aimed 
to explore variations in the oral microbiome of saliva from pre-school Han and 
Uyghur children during ECC development and establish a predictive model based on 
temporal oral microbiome changes. Saliva samples were collected from a single 
kindergarten every three months over six months. Forty-four pre-school children 
provided 132 samples, categorized into six groups: (1) HEF (healthy pre-school 
Han children), (2) HEO (Han children with caries), (3) HEP (Han children with 
progressive caries), (4) WEF (healthy pre-school Uyghur children), (5) WEO 
(Uyghur children with caries), and (6) WEP (Uyghur children with progressive 
caries). Illumina Miseq sequencing identified oral microbiome differences 
between groups and time points. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm established ECC 
prediction models. The T1HEO group exhibited significantly higher Chaol index, 
observed species index, PD whole tree index, and Shannon index than the T2HEO 
group (p < 0.01). Similarly, the T1WEO group had significantly higher Chaol 
index, observed species index, and PD whole tree index than the T2WEO group (p < 
0.05). The AUROC value for the ECC prediction model based on temporal oral flora 
changes was 0.517 (95% CI: 0.275-0.759) for pre-school Han children and 0.896 
(95% CI: 0.78-1.00) for pre-school Uyghur children. In the onset of caries in 
pre-school Han children, bacterial species richness and community diversity in 
saliva declined, paralleled by a decrease in bacterial species richness in 
pre-school Uyghur children's oral saliva. The ECC prediction model grounded on 
temporal oral microflora changes exhibited robust predictive power, particularly 
for pre-school Uyghur children, potentially leading to more effective ECC 
prevention measures.

The review aimed to investigate the diversity of oral microbiota and its 
influencing factors, as well as the association of oral microbiota with oral 
health and the possible effects of dysbiosis and oral disorder. The oral cavity 
harbors a substantial microbial burden, which is particularly notable compared 
to other organs within the human body. In usual situations, the microbiota 
exists in a state of equilibrium; however, when this balance is disturbed, a 
multitude of complications arise. Dental caries, a prevalent issue in the oral 
cavity, is primarily caused by the colonization and activity of bacteria, 
particularly streptococci. Furthermore, this environment also houses other 
pathogenic bacteria that are associated with the onset of gingival, periapical, 
and periodontal diseases, as well as oral cancer. Various strategies have been 
employed to prevent, control, and treat these disorders. Recently, techniques 
utilizing microbiota, like probiotics, microbiota transplantation, and the 
replacement of oral pathogens, have caught the eye. This extensive examination 
seeks to offer a general view of the oral microbiota and their metabolites 
concerning oral health and disease, and also the resilience of the microbiota, 
and the techniques used for the prevention, control, and treatment of disorders 
in this specific area.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the oral microbiota among caries-free (CF) with 
caries-affected (CA) individuals, both at taxonomic and at functional levels.
DESIGN: This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A 
structured search was carried out in MEDLINE/PUBMED, Web of Science, EMBASE, 
LILACS, SciELO, Scopus and Google Scholar databases up to September, 2023. 
Observational studies, without any restriction on date of publication and using 
next-generation targeted or untargeted sequencing methods for identification of 
microbial communities were included. Qualitative synthesis was performed from 
all included studies.
RESULTS: 54 studies were included (43 cross-sectional; 11 cohort) comprising 
more than 3486 participants (at least 1666 CF and 1820 CA) whose saliva and/or 
dental plaque were used as clinical samples. Methodological quality was graded 
as "fair" for most of the studies. The abundance of 87 bacterial and 44 fungal 
genera were statistically different among CF and CA individuals. Atopobium spp., 
Capnocytophaga spp., Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Scardovia spp., 
Selenomonas spp. among others were frequently reported as being more abundant in 
CA individuals. Several functional patterns, such as lipids, carbohydrate, 
starch, sucrose, amino sugar metabolisms, among others, were identified as being 
specifically related to CF or to CA conditions.
CONCLUSION: In spite of the variability among the included studies and of the 
predominance of qualitative synthesis, groups of microorganisms as well as 
specific functional profiles coded by the assessed microbiota are differently 
abundant among caries-affected and caries-free individuals. These results need 
to be interpreted with caution considering the limitations inherent to each 
assessed primary study.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the presence and abundance of 
acid-producing bacteria in dental caries samples using functional gene 
prediction techniques.
DESIGN: A total of 24 dental caries samples were collected for analysis. DNA 
isolation was performed followed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Functional 
gene prediction techniques were used to identify enzymes responsible for acid 
production from primary metabolites. Enzymes responsible for converting primary 
metabolites into acids were identified from the KEGG database. Subsequently, 840 
contigs were examined, and their genus and species were characterized.
RESULTS: Analysis of the obtained data revealed 31 KEGG IDs corresponding to 
enzymes involved in the conversion of primary metabolites into acids. All 117 
identified genera from the contig analysis were found to be part of the oral 
microbiome. In addition, A higher prevalence of acid-producing bacteria was 
noted in dental caries samples compared to earlier reports.
CONCLUSION: The study indicates the significant role of acid-producing bacteria 
in the initiation and progression of dental caries. The findings highlight the 
importance of microbial activity in the demineralization process of tooth 
enamel. Methods for preventing dental decay may be promising if specific 
measures are implemented to reduce the amount of acid produced by oral bacteria.

Many perceive lactic acid bacteria as beneficial for health. They are recognized 
for preventing abnormal fermentation and spoilage of ingested foods by producing 
lactic acid, which aids in gut acidification. Moreover, lactic acid bacteria are 
extensively employed in food science. In contrast, lactic acid bacteria in the 
oral cavity are often perceived as pathogenic factors contributing to the 
development of dental caries. As a consequence, substantial research has been 
conducted in oral and dental sciences to explore lactic acid bacteria and the 
oral microbiome. This research primarily involves analyzing bacterial flora, 
investigating metabolic activities such as acid production, and investigating 
metabolic regulation within the oral environment. The oral cavity serves as the 
gateway to the digestive tract and respiratory system, characterized by a 
constantly fluctuating environment that significantly impacts the metabolic 
activity of lactic acid bacteria. Hence, when investigating oral lactic acid 
bacteria, it is crucial to adopt research plans and methodologies that account 
for these metabolic environment changes. In this section, we present some of the 
methods employed in our study.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to scrutinise the disparities 
in the diversity, structure, and function of the oral microbiome among 
caries-free children from the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups with a focus on the 
influence of ethnically distinct oral health behaviours on the composition of 
the oral microbiota.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted to assess oral health behaviours 
and dental plaque samples were collected from 96 Zhuang and Han children aged 
4-5 years living in Guangxi, southern China for high-throughput sequencing. PCR 
amplification was performed for sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rDNA 
gene, and second-generation sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq 
platform to compare and analyse the diversity, structure and function of the 
microbiota.
RESULTS: Single-factor analysis revealed significant differences between the 
Zhuang and Han ethnic groups regarding juice consumption, the frequency of 
consuming sugar-sweetened food or beverages before bedtime, the age that 
individuals started toothbrushing, the frequency of toothbrushing and the 
frequency of parental assistance with toothbrushing (p < 0.001). The dominant 
phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, etc., and the dominant genera included 
Streptococcus and Neisseria. The dental plaques of the caries-free Zhuang and 
Han ethnic groups had similar core microbiomes, with no significant differences 
in the diversity and structure of the microbiota and no significant differences 
in the abundance of the dominant genera. In addition, no significant difference 
in metabolic function was observed between the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups.
CONCLUSION: The core oral microbiota was consistent in caries-free Zhuang and 
Han children. Despite differences in dietary habits and oral hygiene behaviours 
between the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups, with a high frequency of sugary food 
intake but better oral health behaviours in the Zhuang group, there were no 
significant differences in the diversity, structure and function of the oral 
microbiota of caries-free children in the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups.

Early childhood caries (ECC) is influenced by microbial and host factors, 
including social, behavioral, and oral health. In this cross-sectional study, we 
analyze interkingdom dynamics in the dental plaque microbiome and its 
association with host variables. We use 16S rRNA and ITS1 amplicon sequencing on 
samples collected from preschool children and analyze questionnaire data to 
examine the social determinants of oral health. The results indicate a 
significant enrichment of Streptococcus mutans and Candida dubliniensis in ECC 
samples, in contrast to Neisseria oralis in caries-free children. Our 
interkingdom correlation analysis reveals that Candida dubliniensis is strongly 
correlated with both Neisseria bacilliformis and Prevotella veroralis in ECC. 
Additionally, ECC shows significant associations with host variables, including 
oral health status, age, place of residence, and mode of childbirth. This study 
provides empirical evidence associating the oral microbiome with socioeconomic 
and behavioral factors in relation to ECC, offering insights for developing 
targeted prevention strategies.

Bee Propolis has been used for its therapeutic properties, including 
anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and immune-stimulating properties, 
for centuries as a functional food. This study reviewed the effectiveness of 
propolis as a functional food on oral-related diseases as a rich bioflavonoid 
produced by honey bees. A literature search was conducted to identify studies 
published that investigated the effects of propolis on oral health and its 
ability to treat related diseases. The search was performed in electronic 
databases using relevant keywords. Initially, 3429 studies were identified 
through database searching, and based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
22 articles were eligible to be included. Reviewing the articles, propolis was 
recognized as a functional food and promising agent to balance oral microbiota 
and prevent oral diseases due to its effectiveness on related bacteria, its 
anti-inflammatory properties, and its activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis 
and Actinomyces Oris allowed it to be an effective substance to prevent 
periodontal diseases. Based on our findings, Propolis is a desirable preventive 
option for various oral health conditions, including dental caries and 
periodontal diseases. Therefore, it is recommended to be consumed as a 
functional food in our daily diet, which can reduce the risk of oral disease and 
improve oral health.

Dental caries, as a biofilm-related disease, is closely linked to dysbiosis in 
microbial ecology within dental biofilms. Beyond its impact on oral health, 
bacteria within the oral cavity pose systemic health risks by potentially 
entering the bloodstream, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial 
endocarditis, among other related diseases. Streptococcus mutans, a principal 
cariogenic bacterium, possesses virulence factors crucial to the pathogenesis of 
dental caries. Its ability to adhere to tooth surfaces, produce glucans for 
biofilm formation, and metabolize sugars into lactic acid contributes to enamel 
demineralization and the initiation of carious lesions. Its aciduricity and 
ability to produce bacteriocins enable a competitive advantage, allowing it to 
thrive in acidic environments and dominate in changing oral microenvironments. 
In contrast, commensal streptococci, such as Streptococcus sanguinis, 
Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus salivarius, act as primary colonizers 
and compete with S. mutans for adherence sites and nutrients during biofilm 
formation. This competition involves the production of alkali, peroxides, and 
antibacterial substances, thereby inhibiting S. mutans growth and maintaining 
microbial balance. This dynamic interaction influences the balance of oral 
microbiota, with disruptions leading to shifts in microbial composition that are 
marked by rapid increases in S. mutans abundance, contributing to the onset of 
dental caries. Thus, understanding the dynamic interactions between commensal 
and pathogenic bacteria in oral microecology is important for developing 
effective strategies to promote oral health and prevent dental caries. This 
review highlights the roles and competitive interactions of commensal bacteria 
and S. mutans in oral microecology, emphasizing the importance of maintaining 
oral microbial balance for health, and discusses the pathological implications 
of perturbations in this balance.

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance within bacterial communities poses 
formidable challenges to existing therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating 
biofilm-mediated infections. Recent advancements in this domain have spurred the 
development of targeted antimicrobial agents, designed to selectively eradicate 
the primary etiological agents while preserving the beneficial microbial 
diversity of the oral cavity. Targeting glucosyltransferases (GTFs), which play 
crucial roles in dental biofilm formation, offers a precise strategy to inhibit 
extracellular polysaccharide synthesis without compromising oral microbiota. 
This review article delves into the intricate mechanisms underlying dental 
caries, with a specific focus on the role of GTFs, enzymes produced by S. 
mutans. It further provides an overview of current research on GTF inhibitors, 
exploring their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and potential applications in 
clinical practice. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges and opportunities in 
the development of novel GTF inhibitors, emphasizing the need for innovative 
approaches to combat biofilm-mediated oral diseases effectively.

OBJECTIVES: Dental caries result from a microbial imbalance in the oral cavity. 
Probiotics ecologically modulate the oral microflora to prevent caries. This 
study evaluated the anti-cariogenic effects of two Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 
strains in vitro and in vivo to provide a more theoretical basis for its 
clinical applications in caries prevention.
METHODS: In the study, cariogenic biofilms were grown with L. rhamnosus (LGG) or 
L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469 and analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Scanning 
Electron Microscope (SEM), and Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) were 
used to detect the changes in the composition and architectures; cariogenic 
activity was measured by the lactic acid production and Transverse 
Microradiography (TMR). The effects of LGG on the 12 Sprague-Dawley rat caries 
model were assessed using Keyes scores and micro-CT analysis. Oral microbiome 
changes were evaluated through 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing.
RESULTS: L. rhamnosus can reduce cariogenic bacteria in biofilm by 14.7 % to 
48.9 %, with LGG exhibiting more potent inhibitory effects. Both strains of L. 
rhamnosus can adhere to the surface of biofilms, reduce the extracellular 
polysaccharides (EPS) matrix, and loosen the biofilm structure. L. rhamnosus 
inhibited cariogenic activity by reducing the lactic acid production in 
biofilms. The bovine enamel blocks presented lower mineral loss values and 
lesion depth values in the group Core+L.rh and Core+LGG. LGG-ingested rats had 
significantly lower levels of moderate dentin lesions and higher mineral density 
than the control group. The 16 s rRNA gene sequencing revealed that LGG 
regulated the beta diversity of the oral microbial community in the rat dental 
caries model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the promising potential of L. rhamnosus, 
especially the LGG strain, in the ecological prevention of dental caries.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Probiotics may provide a strategy for preventing caries 
by regulating the oral microecological balance. The study revealed the promising 
anti-caries potential of the LGG probiotic strain in vivo and in vitro. It is 
expected that LGG could be used as an oral probiotic for the clinical prevention 
and treatment of caries.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to engineer and optimise a dysbiotic biofilm model 
to develop in vitro root caries for investigating microbial modulation 
strategies. The model involved growing complex biofilms from a saliva inoculum 
collected from four volunteers using two strategies. In the first strategy 
("pre-treatment strategy"), bovine root slabs were used, and two natural 
compounds were incorporated at time 0 of the 10-day biofilm experiment, which 
included sucrose cycles mimicking the cariogenic environment. In the second 
strategy ("post-treatment strategy"), mature biofilms were grown in a modified 
Calgary biofilm device coated with collagen and hydroxyapatite for 7 days and 
then were exposed to the same natural compounds. The metatranscriptome of each 
biofilm was then determined and analysed. Collagenase activity was examined, and 
the biofilms and dentine were imaged using confocal and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). Mineral loss and lesion formation were confirmed through 
micro-computed tomography (μ-CT).
RESULTS: The pH confirmed the cariogenic condition. In the metatranscriptome, we 
achieved a biofilm compositional complexity, showing a great diversity of the 
metabolically active microbiome in both pre- and post-treatment strategies, 
including reads mapped to microorganisms other than bacteria, such as archaea 
and viruses. Carbohydrate esterases had increased expression in the post-treated 
biofilms and in samples without sugar cycles, while glucosyltransferases were 
highly expressed in the presence of sucrose cycles. Enrichment for functions 
related to nitrogen compound metabolism and organic cyclic component metabolism 
in groups without sucrose compared to the sucrose-treated group. Pre-treatment 
of the roots with cranberry reduced microbial viability and gelatinase (but not 
collagenase) activity (p < 0.05). SEM images showed the complexity of biofilms 
was maintained, with a thick extracellular polysaccharides layer.
CONCLUSIONS: This root caries model was optimized to produce complex cariogenic 
biofilms and root caries-like lesions, and could be used to test microbial 
modulation in vitro. Pre-treatments before biofilm development and cariogenic 
challenges were more effective than post-treatments. The clinical significance 
lies in the potential to apply the findings to develop varnish products for 
post-professional tooth prophylaxis, aiming at implementing a strategy for 
dysbiosis reversal in translational research. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: The global rise in the elderly population has increased the 
prevalence of root caries. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacilli and Actinomyces 
are considered the primary pathogens of dental caries in culture-based studies. 
This study aimed to investigate bacterial profiles in coronal and root caries 
lesions and determine the association of specific bacterial genera at each site.
METHODS: Dentine samples from carious lesions were collected from 22 extracted 
teeth using an excavator. Microbial DNA was extracted from the samples using a 
protocol developed for this study. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was 
employed for microbial analysis. PCR amplification targeted the V3-V4 region of 
the bacterial 16S rRNA, and the amplicon sequencing used an Illumina MiSeq 
system (2 × 300 bp paired-end reads). Statistical analysis was performed by the 
Phyloseq and DESeq2 packages in R.
RESULTS: In coronal caries, Olsenella, Lactobacillus and Prevotella were the 
most prevalent genera, comprising approximately 70% of the microbiome community. 
In the root caries, however, although Olsenella, Prevotella and Lactobacillus 
remained the dominant genera, they accounted for only half of the microbiome 
community. This study identified significant differences in alpha diversity 
indices between the coronal and root caries. LEfSE analysis revealed several 
unique genera in each caries lesion.
CONCLUSION: The microbiome of root caries lesions was richer and more complex 
than the coronal caries microbiota. The results suggest that lesion-related 
variations in the oral microflora may be detected in carious dentine.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The tongue harbors about two-thirds of the microorganisms 
present in the mouth; the stable bacterial population consists mainly of aerobic 
and facultative anaerobic streptococci. These bacterial colonies, found more 
frequently on the tongue than on the outside of the hard part of the dental 
enamel in children younger than 18 months, suggest that the tongue is a 
potential bacterial reservoir. The aim of this review is to examine the 
scientific literature to clarify whether the mechanical removal of bacterial 
biofilm on the tongue can have a positive effect on caries prevention, with the 
reduction in colony-forming unit (CFU) of salivary streptococcus and the 
whole-mouth plaque index (FMPS).
METHODS: An open literature search was conducted by using PubMed (MEDLINE), 
Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. The most studied age range was 9 to 12 
years, with groups of children with no caries and groups with a minimum number 
of two teeth that were reconstructed, decayed and/or missing (DMFS/dmfs > 2) who 
experienced different tongue hygiene methods for the first time.
RESULTS: Four randomized trials met the search criteria and were included in 
this review.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained suggest that specific tongue hygiene 
protocols, combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, could be considered the 
gold standard to enable more effective primary prevention and improve the health 
of pediatric patients. This review improves the understanding of the impact of 
tongue hygiene in controlling the bacteria responsible for the onset of carious 
disease and its systemic correlates; however, further research with more data is 
needed to further confirm the findings of this research.

BACKGROUND: Preand probiotics may help restore a dysbiotic oral ecosystem. The 
first years of life provide a window of opportunity to modulate the composition 
of the oral microbiota and prevent disease.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a 
tablet containing inactivated Ligilactobacillus salivarius CECT 5317 and the 
cranberry extract on the development of caries in cariesactive preschool 
children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind design. Preschool children (N = 73) with at least one active 
carious lesion were enrolled and randomly assigned to the test group or the 
placebo group. The intervention period was 3 months. Caries was assessed 
according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) II 
criteria at baseline and after 9 months, and oral hygiene was evaluated with the 
simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S). The salivary counts of Streptococcus 
mutans and Lactobacillus spp. were determined at baseline, and then after 3 and 
9 months through the conventional cultivation on TYCSB and MRS agar, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Sixty children completed the trial (a dropout rate of 19%). The 
baseline caries prevalence was high in both groups (~71%) and there were no 
major differences between the groups with regard to background variables. The 
9-month incidence of initial carious lesions (ICDAS 1+2) was significantly lower 
in the test group as compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). The plaque 
levels, and the salivary counts of S. mutans and Lactobacillus spp. remained 
unchanged in both groups throughout the study.
CONCLUSIONS: A daily intake of a tablet containing a paraprobiotic and the 
cranberry extract reduced the 9-month incidence of initial non-cavitated carious 
lesions in caries-active preschool children. The present study is one of the 
first to show the impact of synbiotics on the development of caries in children.

The scientific literature dealing with alcohol and alcoholic beverages revealed 
that these drinks possess an adverse impact on periodontal tissues. 
Additionally, other principal risk factors include tobacco, smoking, poor oral 
hygiene, etc. It has been observed that among chronic alcoholics, there are 
further issues, such as mental, social, and physical effects, that promote 
alcoholism. These people may have weak immunity for defense against pathogenic 
organisms and bacteria. Thus, chances of gingival bleeding, swollen gums, bad 
breath, and increased bone loss are there. Different alcoholic beverages in the 
market cause less salivation; these beverages contain sugars that promote acid 
production in the oral cavity by pathogens that demineralize the enamel and 
damage gum and teeth. This chronic alcohol consumption can progress into 
different types of oral disorders, including cancer, halitosis, and caries, and 
is also associated with tobacco and smoking. Chronic alcohol consumption can 
cause alteration of the oral microbiome and increase oral pathogens, which lead 
to periodontal disease and an environment of inflammation created in the body 
due to malnutrition, diminished immunity, altered liver condition, brain damage, 
and gut microbiota alteration. Heavily colored alcoholic beverages produce 
staining on teeth and, due to less saliva, may cause other toxic effects on the 
periodontium. Over-dependency on alcohol leads to necrotizing lesions such as 
necrotizing gingivitis, necrotizing periodontitis, and necrotizing stomatitis. 
These pathological impairments instigate severe damage to oral structures. 
Therefore, proper counseling by the attending dental surgeon and related health 
professionals is urgently required for the patient on the basis that the 
individual case needs to go away from the regular heavy consumption of alcohol.

INTRODUCTION: Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a commonly used antiseptic in situations of 
limited oral hygiene ability such as after periodontal surgery. However, CHX is 
also considered as a possible factor in the emergence of cross-resistance to 
antibiotics. The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in the oral 
microbiota and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) due to 
CHX treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the oral metagenome of 20 patients who 
applied a 0.2% CHX mouthwash twice daily for 4 weeks following periodontal 
surgical procedures. Saliva and supragingival plaque samples were examined 
before, directly after 4 weeks, and another 4 weeks after discontinuing the CHX 
treatment.
RESULTS: Alpha-diversity decreased significantly with CHX use. The Bray-Curtis 
dissimilarity increased in both sample sites and mainly streptococci showed a 
higher relative abundance after CHX treatment. Although no significant changes 
of ARGs could be detected, an increase in prevalence was found for genes that 
encode for tetracycline efflux pumps.
CONCLUSION: CHX treatment appears to promote a caries-associated bacterial 
community and the emergence of tetracycline resistance genes. Future research 
should focus on CHX-related changes in the microbial community and whether the 
discovered tetracycline resistance genes promote resistance to CHX.

Oral microorganisms are closely related to oral health, the occurrence of some 
oral diseases is associated with changes in the oral microbiota, and many 
studies have demonstrated that traditional smoking can affect the oral microbial 
community. However, due to the short time since the emergence of e-cigarettes, 
fewer studies are comparing oral microorganisms for users of e-cigarettes versus 
cigarettes. We collected saliva from 40 non-smokers (NS), 46 traditional 
cigarette smokers (TS), and 27 e-cigarette consumers (EC), aged between 18 and 
35 years. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the saliva samples collected 
to study the effects of e-cigarettes versus traditional cigarettes on the oral 
microbiome. The results showed that compared with the NS group, the alpha 
diversity of oral flora in saliva was altered in the TS group, with no 
significant change in the e-cigarette group. Compared with the NS and EC groups, 
the relative abundance of Actinomyces and Prevotella was increased in the TS 
group. However, compared with the NS and TS groups, the relative abundance of 
Veillonella was increased, and the relative abundance of Porphyromonas and 
Peptostreptococcus was decreased in the EC group. These results showed that both 
e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes could alter the structure and 
composition of oral microbiota. The use of traditional cigarettes promotes the 
growth of some anaerobic bacteria, which may contribute to dental decay and bad 
breath over time. E-cigarettes have a different effect on the structure and 
composition of the oral microbial community compared to conventional cigarettes. 
In order to better understand the effects of e-cigarettes and traditional 
cigarettes on users' mouths, future studies will investigate the relationship 
between diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis and changes in oral 
microbial species levels.

OBJECTIVE: In this in vivo proof-of-concept study, acquired pellicle engineering 
was implemented to promote alterations in the protein composition of the 
acquired enamel pellicle (AEP) and the bacterial composition of the dental 
biofilm after treatment with Sugarcane cystatin (CaneCPI-5).
DESIGN: After prophylaxis, 10 volunteers rinsed (10 mL, 1 min) with the 
following solutions: 1) deionized water (H2O- negative control or 2) 0.1 mg/mL 
CaneCPI-5. The AEP and biofilm were formed along 2 or 3 h, respectively. The AEP 
was collected with electrode filter papers soaked in 3 % citric acid. After 
protein extraction, samples were analyzed by quantitative shotgun label-free 
proteomics. The biofilm microbiome was collected with a dental curette. The DNA 
was extracted, amplified, and analyzed by 16S-rRNA Next Generation Sequencing 
(NGS).
RESULTS: Treatment with CaneCPI-5 increased several proteins with antimicrobial, 
acid-resistance, affinity for hydroxyapatite, structural and calcium binding 
properties, such as Cysteine-rich-3 (6-fold-p = 0.03), Cystatin-B 
(5.5-fold-p < 0.01), Neutrophil-defensin 1 (4.7-fold-p < 0.01), Mucin 
(3.9-fold-p < 0.01), Immunoglobulin-heavy-constant (3.8-fold-p < 0.01) and 
Lactotransferrin (2.8-fold-p < 0.01). Microbiome revealed that several commensal 
bacteria had their abundance increased after rinsing with CaneCPI-5, such as 
Corynebacterium and Neisseria, while Streptococcus and Prevotella nigrescens 
were decreased. The results indicate the efficiency of CaneCPI-5 in promoting 
beneficial changes in the AEP and biofilm, making this phytocystatin a potential 
target for incorporation into dental products.
CONCLUSION: Cane demonstrated the capability to alter the protein composition of 
the acquired enamel pellicle (AEP) and the initial colonizers of the biofilm, 
enhancing the presence of proteins and bacteria crucial for dental protection.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to examine the relationship between 
oral diseases and respiratory health, investigating how oral microbiome 
disruptions contribute to respiratory tract infections. Additionally, it aims to 
explore the impact of respiratory disease symptoms and treatments on the oral 
microbiome.
DATA SOURCES: The literature utilized in this review was sourced from studies 
focusing on the correlation between oral health and respiratory infections, 
spanning a period of 40 years. Various databases and scholarly sources were 
likely consulted to gather relevant research articles, reviews, and clinical 
studies.
STUDY SELECTION: This review summarizes four decades-long research, providing 
insights into the intricate relationship between oral and respiratory health. It 
delves into how oral diseases influence respiratory tract conditions and vice 
versa. The selection process likely involved identifying studies that addressed 
the interaction between oral microbiome disruptions and respiratory 
complications.
CONCLUSION: Oral diseases or poor oral habits have been known to increase the 
risk of getting respiratory infections. Modern techniques have demonstrated the 
relationship between oral disease and respiratory tract infections like 
influenza, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma, and Pneumonia. Apart 
from that, the medications used to treat respiratory diseases affect oral 
physiological factors like the pH of saliva, and saliva flow rate, which can 
cause significant changes in the oral microbiome. This review provides regular 
oral hygiene and care that can prevent respiratory health and respiratory 
infections.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the intricate relationship between oral 
health and respiratory infections is crucial for healthcare providers. 
Implementing preventive measures and promoting good oral hygiene habits can 
reduce respiratory tract infections and improve overall respiratory health 
outcomes.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to validate qPCR assays for specific microbiota, for 
use on dental plaque samples stored on Whatman FTA cards to compare relative 
oral health risk in Rett syndrome.
METHODS: Supragingival dental plaque samples were collected, using a sterile 
swab, (COPAN FLOQswab™) swabbed onto Whatman FTA™ cards. DNA extraction was 
performed using a modified Powersoil™ protocol. Where published assays were 
unsuitable, species-specific qPCR assays for caries-associated, 
gingivitis-associated and oral-health-associated bacteria were designed using 
multiple sequence alignment, Primer3Plus and PrimerQuest. Assays were run using 
absolute quantification. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification 
(LOQ) were calculated, and PCR products verified by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Most assays allowed detection using real-time qPCR with high 
specificity on samples collected on FTA cards. Several assays showed low or even 
single gene copy numbers on the test samples.
CONCLUSION: Assays were optimised for detection and evaluation of oral health 
risk in dental plaque samples stored on FTA cards when cold storage is not 
feasible, except for F. nucleatum. Several assays showed gene copy numbers less 
than the LOQ or outside the range of the standard curve, so there is merit in 
optimising these assays using digital droplet PCR.

OBJECTIVES: Self-performed oral hygiene is essential for preventing dental 
caries, periodontal, and peri-implant diseases. Oral irrigators are adjunctive 
oral home care aids that may benefit oral health. However, the effects of oral 
irrigation on oral health, its role in oral home care, and its mechanism of 
action are not fully understood. A comprehensive search of the literature 
revealed no existing broad scoping reviews on oral irrigators. Therefore, this 
study aimed to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the literature on 
oral irrigation devices and identify evidence gaps.
METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute and Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines 
were utilized to prepare the review. Four databases and eight gray literature 
sources were searched for English publications across any geographical location 
or setting.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five sources were included, predominantly from 
scientific journals and academic settings. Most studies originated from North 
America. Research primarily involved adults, with limited studies in children 
and adolescents. Oral irrigation was safe and well-accepted when used 
appropriately. It reduced periodontal inflammation, potentially by modulating 
the oral microbiota, but further research needs to clarify its mechanism of 
action. Promising results were reported in populations with dental implants and 
special needs. Patient acceptance appeared high, but standardized 
patient-reported outcome measures were rarely used. Anti-inflammatory benefits 
occurred consistently across populations and irrigant solutions. Plaque 
reduction findings were mixed, potentially reflecting differences in study 
designs and devices.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral irrigators reduce periodontal inflammation, but their impact 
on plaque removal remains unclear. Well-designed, sufficiently powered trials of 
appropriate duration need to assess the clinical, microbiological, and 
inflammatory responses of the periodontium to oral irrigation, particularly 
those with periodontitis, dental implants, and special needs. Patient-reported 
outcome measures, costs, caries prevention, and environmental impact of oral 
irrigation need to be compared to other oral hygiene aids.

BACKGROUND: The status of dental caries is closely related to changes in the 
oral microbiome. In this study, we compared the diversity and structure of the 
dental plaque microbiome in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) 
before and after general anaesthesia and outpatient treatment.
METHODS: Forty children aged 3 to 5 years with S-ECC who had completed 
whole-mouth dental treatment under general anaesthesia (C1) or in outpatient 
settings (C2) were selected, 20 in each group. The basic information and oral 
health status of the children were recorded, and the microbial community 
structure and diversity of dental plaque before treatment (C1, C2), the day 
after treatment(C2_0D), 7 days after treatment (C1_7D, C2_7D), 1 month after 
treatment (C1_1M, C2_1M), and 3 months after treatment (C1_3M, C2_3M) were 
analysed via 16 S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology.
RESULTS: (1) The alpha diversity test showed that the flora richness in the 
multiappointment group was significantly greater at posttreatment than at 
pretreatment (P < 0.05), and the remaining alpha diversity index did not 
significantly differ between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The beta diversity 
analysis revealed that the flora structures of the C1_7D group and the C2_3M 
group were significantly different from those of the other time points within 
the respective groups (P < 0.05). (2) The core flora existed in both the pre- 
and posttreatment groups, and the proportion of their flora abundance could be 
altered depending on the caries status of the children in both groups. 
Leptotrichia abundance was significantly (P < 0.05) lower at 7 days 
posttreatment in both the single- and multiappointment groups. Corynebacterium 
and Corynebacterium_matruchotii were significantly more abundant in the C1_1M 
and C1_3M groups than in the C1 and C1_7D groups (P < 0.05). Streptococcus, 
Haemophilus and Haemophilus_parainfluenzae were significantly more abundant in 
the C1_7D group than in the other groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A single session of treatment under general anaesthesia can cause 
dramatic changes in the microbial community structure and composition within 7 
days after treatment, whereas treatment over multiple appointments may cause 
slow changes in oral flora diversity.

In recent years, the quest for healthier alternatives to sugar has led to the 
widespread use of sugar alcohol in various food and beverage products. Sugar 
alcohols, such as xylitol, sorbitol, and erythritol, are popular substitutes due 
to their sweet taste and lower calorie content than sucrose. Beyond their role 
in calorie reduction, sugar alcohols have garnered attention for their potential 
impact on oral health. The bibliometric analysis of clinical trials on sugar 
alcohol and oral health in PubMed reveals a dynamic and multifaceted research 
landscape shaped by various factors. Fluctuations in publication rates over time 
suggest influences such as shifts in research interests, technological 
advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving consumer behaviors. Key authors 
like Makinen KK, Makinen PL, and Soderling E emerge as prolific contributors 
with collaborative solid networks within the research community. The University 
of Turku in Finland has been identified as the highest contributing university, 
while Caries Research is the most contributing journal based on the number of 
clinical trials published. The country-wise analysis highlights Italy and the 
United States as substantial contributors, with diverse trajectories of research 
activity observed across nations. The subject-specific words with the highest 
cooccurrence are xylitol, dental caries, chewing gum, Streptococcus mutans, and 
saliva. Thematic analysis dives deep into how sugar alcohols relate to oral 
health, using different methods to study their effectiveness, safety, and how 
they affect the oral microbiome. The analysis of topic trends indicates ongoing 
exploration of sorbitol and xylitol, with an increasing emphasis on the 
potential advantages of xylitol. Additionally, there is notable attention on 
cariostatic agents, strategies for dental caries prevention, and the emergence 
of novel research domains like probiotics and erythritol, showcasing the dynamic 
evolution of oral health research focuses and developments. Overall, this 
analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution and trends of clinical 
trial publications, contributing to a nuanced understanding of the research 
landscape in sugar alcohol and oral health.

The human oral microbiome may alter oral and systemic disease risk. Consuming 
high sugar content beverages (HSB) can lead to caries development by altering 
the microbial composition in dental plaque, but little is known regarding 
HSB-specific oral microbial alterations. Therefore, we conducted a large, 
population-based study to examine associations of HSB intake with oral 
microbiome diversity and composition. Using mouthwash samples of 989 individuals 
in two nationwide U.S. cohorts, bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified, 
sequenced, and assigned to bacterial taxa. HSB intake was quantified from food 
frequency questionnaires as low (< 1 serving/week), medium (1-3 servings/week), 
or high (> 3 servings/week). We assessed overall bacterial diversity and 
presence of specific taxa with respect to HSB intake in each cohort separately 
and combined in a meta-analysis. Consistently in the two cohorts, we found lower 
species richness in high HSB consumers (> 3 cans/week) (p = 0.027), and that 
overall bacterial community profiles differed from those of non-consumers 
(PERMANOVA p = 0.040). Specifically, presence of a network of commensal bacteria 
(Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Alloprevotella rava) was less 
common in high compared to non-consumers, as were other species including 
Campylobacter showae, Prevotella oulorum, and Mycoplasma faucium. Presence of 
acidogenic bacteria Bifodobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was more 
common in high consumers. Abundance of Fusobacteriales and its genus 
Leptotrichia, Lachnoanaerobaculum sp., and Campylobacter were lower with higher 
HSB consumption, and their abundances were correlated. No significant 
interaction was found for these associations with diabetic status or with 
microbial markers for caries (S. mutans) and periodontitis (P. gingivalis). Our 
results suggest that soft drink intake may alter the salivary microbiota, with 
consistent results across two independent cohorts. The observed perturbations of 
overrepresented acidogenic bacteria and underrepresented commensal bacteria in 
high HSB consumers may have implications for oral and systemic disease risk.

BACKGROUND: Since most of the commonly known oral diseases are explained in link 
with balance of microbial community, an accurate bacterial taxonomy profiling 
for determining bacterial compositional network is essential. However, compared 
to intestinal microbiome, research data pool related to oral microbiome is 
small, and general 16S rRNA screening method has a taxonomy misclassification 
issue in confirming complex bacterial composition at the species level.
OBJECTIVE: Present study aimed to explore bacterial compositional networks at 
the species level within saliva of 39 oral disease patients (Dental Caries 
group: n = 26 and Periodontitis group: n = 13) through comparison with public 
Korean-specific healthy oral microbiome data.
METHODS: Here, we applied comprehensive molecular diagnostics based on qRT-PCR 
and Sanger sequencing methods to complement the technical limitations of 
NGS-based 16S V3-V4 amplicon sequencing technology.
RESULTS: As a result of microbiome profiling at the genus level, relative 
frequencies of many nitrate-reducing bacteria within each oral disease group 
were found to be significantly low compared to the healthy group. In addition, 
the molecular diagnostics-based bacterial identification method allowed the 
determination of the correct taxonomy of screened primary colonizers 
(Streptococcus and Actinomyces unclassification clusters) for each oral disease. 
Finally, as with the results of microbiome profiling at the genus level, many 
core-species classified within the saliva of each oral disease group were also 
related to nitrate-reduction, and it was estimated that various pathogens 
associated with each disease formed a bacterial network with the core-species.
CONCLUSION: Our study introduced a novel approach that can compensate for the 
difficulty of identifying an accurate bacterial compositional network at the 
species level due to unclear taxonomy classification by using the convergent 
approach of NGS-molecular diagnostics. Ultimately, we suggest that our 
experimental approach and results could be potential reference materials for 
researchers who intend to prevent oral disease by determining the correlation 
between oral health and bacterial compositional network according to the changes 
in the relative frequency for nitrate-reducing species.

BACKGROUND: Microbiomes are essential components of the human body, and their 
populations are substantial. Under normal circumstances, microbiomes coexist 
harmoniously with the human body, but disturbances in this equilibrium can lead 
to various diseases. The oral microbiome is involved in the occurrence and 
development of many oral and gastrointestinal diseases. This review focuses on 
the relationship between oral microbiomes and oral and upper gastrointestinal 
diseases, and therapeutic strategies aiming to provide valuable insights for 
clinical prevention and treatment.
METHODS: To identify relevant studies, we conducted searches in PubMed, Google 
Scholar, and Web of Science using keywords such as "oral microbiome," "oral 
flora, " "gastrointestinal disease, " without any date restrictions. 
Subsequently, the retrieved publications were subject to a narrative review.
RESULTS: In this review, we found that oral microbiomes are closely related to 
oral and gastrointestinal diseases such as periodontitis, dental caries, reflux 
esophagitis, gastritis, and upper gastrointestinal tumors (mainly the malignant 
ones). Oral samples like saliva and buccal mucosa are not only easy to collect, 
but also display superior sample stability compared to gastrointestinal tissues. 
Consequently, analysis of the oral microbiome could potentially serve as an 
efficient preliminary screening method for high-risk groups before undergoing 
endoscopic examination. Besides, treatments based on the oral microbiomes could 
aid early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral microbiomes are essential to oral and gastrointestinal 
diseases. Therapies centered on the oral microbiomes could facilitate the early 
detection and management of these conditions.

Plain Language Summary: 1. Various microbiomes exist in the oral cavity. 2. 
Under normal circumstances, oral microbes and human health coexist in harmony, 
once this balance is broken, it may cause a variety of diseases. 3. Oral 
microbiota are associated with upper digestive diseases, which are expected to 
be an effective triage for high-risk population before endoscopic screening.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of daily use of a multiple-enzyme lozenge on 
de novo plaque formation, on gingivitis development, and on the oral microbiome 
composition.
METHODS: This trial with two parallel arms included 24 healthy adults allocated 
to the Active (n = 12) or Placebo (n = 12) group. Subjects consumed one lozenge 
three times daily for seven days, and no oral hygiene procedures were allowed. 
Differences in de novo plaque accumulation between a baseline period, and one 
and seven days of intervention were assessed by the Turesky-modification of the 
Quigley-and-Hein-Plaque-Index (TM-QHPI). The development of gingivitis after 
seven days of intervention was assessed by the Gingival Index (GI). Plaque and 
saliva samples were collected at baseline and after seven days of intervention, 
and evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. 
After one day, the average TM-QHPI was significantly lower in the Active than in 
the Placebo group, as compared to baseline (p = 0.012). After 7 days, average 
TM-QHPI values did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.37). GI values 
did not increase during the intervention period, with no difference between 
groups (p = 0.62). Bacterial richness increased in both plaque and saliva 
samples over a seven-day oral hygiene-free period, with a statistically 
significant difference for the saliva samples (p = 0.0495) between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A multiple-enzymes lozenge decreased the build-up of de novo plaque 
after one day and slowed down the process of species increment in saliva. The 
lozenge may be an adjunct to regular mechanical plaque removal.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dental plaque is the main cause of caries, gingivitis, 
and periodontitis. The search for therapeutic adjuncts to mechanical plaque 
removal that have no harmful effects on the oral microbiome is important. 
Treatment with multiple plaque-matrix degrading enzymes is a promising 
non-biocidal approach to plaque control.

Biofilm formation constitutes the primary cause of various chronic infections, 
such as wound infections, gastrointestinal inflammation and dental caries. While 
preliminary achievement of biofilm inhibition is possible, the challenge lies in 
the difficulty of eliminating the bactericidal effects of current drugs that 
lead to microbiota imbalance. This study, utilizing in vitro and in vivo models 
of dental caries, aims to efficiently inhibit biofilm formation without inducing 
bactericidal effects, even against pathogenic bacteria. The tetrahedral 
framework nucleic acid (tFNA) was employed as a delivery vector for a 
small-molecule inhibitor (smI) specifically targeting the activity of 
glucosyltransferases C (GtfC). It was observed that tFNA loaded smI in a 
small-groove binding manner, efficiently transferring it into Streptococcus 
mutans, thereby inhibiting GtfC activity and extracellular polymeric substances 
formation without compromising bacterial survival. Furthermore, smI-loaded tFNA 
demonstrated a reduction in the severity of dental caries in vivo without 
adversely affecting oral microbial diversity and exhibited desirable topical and 
systemic biosafety. This study emphasizes the concept of 'ecological prevention 
of biofilm', which is anticipated to advance the optimization of biofilm 
prevention strategies and the clinical application of DNA nanocarrier-based drug 
formulations.

OBJECTIVES: Severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) is highly prevalent, affecting 
children's oral health. S-ECC development is closely associated with the complex 
oral microbial microbiome and its microorganism interactions, such as the 
imbalance of bacteriophages and bacteria. Till now, little is known about oral 
phageome on S-ECC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential role 
of the oral phageome in the pathogenesis of S-ECC.
METHODS: Unstimulated saliva (2 mL) was collected from 20 children with and 
without S-ECC for metagenomics analysis. Metagenomics sequencing and 
bioinformatic analysis were performed to determine the two groups' phageome 
diversity, taxonomic and functional annotations. Statistical analysis and 
visualization were performed with R and SPSS Statistics software.
RESULTS: 85.7 % of the extracted viral sequences were predicted from phages, in 
which most phages were classified into Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and 
Podoviridae. Alpha diversity decreased, and Beta diversity increased in the 
S-ECC phageome compared to the healthy group. The abundance of Podoviridae 
phages increased, and the abundance of Inoviridae, Herelleviridae, and 
Streptococcus phages decreased in the S-ECC group. Functional annotation 
revealed increased annotation on glycoside hydrolases and nucleotide metabolism, 
decreased glycosyl transferases, carbohydrate-binding modules, and biogenic 
metabolism in the S-ECC phageome.
CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic analysis revealed reduced Streptococcus phages and 
significant changes in functional annotations within the S-ECC phageome. These 
findings suggest a potential weakening of the regulatory influence of oral 
bacteria, which may indicate the development of innovative prevention and 
treatment strategies for S-ECC. These implications deserve further investigation 
and hold promise for advancing our understanding and management of S-ECC.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study indicate that oral phageomes 
are associated with bacterial genomes and metabolic processes, affecting the 
development of S-ECC. The reduced modulatory effect of the oral phageome in 
counteracting S-ECC's cariogenic activity suggests a new avenue for the 
prevention and treatment of S-ECC.

INTRODUCTION: Alveolar cleft (AC) is a common congenital defect in people with 
cleft lip and palate (CLP). Alveolar bone grafting (ABG) is typically performed 
during adolescence, resulting in the fissure remaining in the mouth for a longer 
length of time. Patients with AC have a greater rate of oral diseases such as 
dental caries than the normal population, and the precise characteristics of the 
bacterial alterations caused by AC are unknown.
METHODS: We recruited a total of 87 subjects and collected dental plaque samples 
from AC adolescents (AAP), post-operative ABG adolescents (PAP), healthy control 
adolescents (CAP), AC young adults (AYP), post-operative ABG young adults (PYP), 
and healthy control young adults (CYP). The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was 
performed.
RESULTS: The microbial composition of plaque from alveolar cleft patients 
differed significantly from age-matched healthy controls. Linear discriminant 
analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed that AAP was enriched for 
Neisseria, Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, Rhodococcus, Aggregatibacter, Gemella, 
and Porphyromonas, whereas AYP was enriched for Capnocytophaga, Rhodococcus, and 
Actinomyces-f0332. There were phenotypic differences in facultatively anaerobic, 
Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and oxidative stress tolerance between the AYP 
group with longer alveolar cleft and the healthy control group according to 
Bugbase phenotypic predictions. Alveolar bone grafting did not alter the 
functional phenotype of alveolar cleft patients but reduced the number of 
differential genera between alveolar cleft patients and healthy controls at both 
ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study systematically characterized the supragingival plaque 
microbiota of alveolar cleft patients, post-alveolar bone grafting patients, and 
matched healthy controls in two ages to gain a better understanding of plaque 
ecology and microbiology associated with alveolar clefts.

The high prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease place a significant 
burden on society, both socially and economically. Recent advances in genomic 
technologies have linked both diseases to shifts in the oral microbiota - a 
community of >700 bacterial species that live within the mouth. The development 
of oral microbiome transplantation draws on the success of fecal microbiome 
transplantation for the treatment of gut pathologies associated with disease. 
Many current in vitro oral biofilm models have been developed but do not fully 
capture the complexity of the oral microbiome which is required for successful 
OMT. To address this, we developed an in vitro biofilm system that maintained an 
oral microbiome with 252 species on average over 14 days. Six human plaque 
samples were grown in 3D printed flow cells on hydroxyapatite discs using 
artificial saliva medium (ASM). Biofilm composition and growth were monitored by 
high throughput sequencing and confocal microscopy/SEM, respectively. While a 
significant drop in bacterial diversity occurred, up to 291 species were 
maintained in some flow cells over 14 days with 70% viability grown with ASM. 
This novel in vitro biofilm model represents a marked improvement on existing 
oral biofilm systems and provides new opportunities to develop oral microbiome

Data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that probiotics positively 
impact clinical parameters of oral diseases such as gingivitis, dental caries, 
and periodontitis. However, the working mechanism of probiotics is not fully 
understood, but is hypothesized to be mediated by direct and indirect 
interactions with the oral microbiota and the human host. In the present 
narrative review, we focused on the microbiological effect of probiotic 
supplements based on data retrieved from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In 
addition, we assessed to what extent contemporary molecular methods have been 
employed in clinical trials in the field of oral probiotics. Multiple RCTs have 
been performed studying the potential effect of probiotics on gingivitis, dental 
caries, and periodontitis, as evaluated by microbial endpoints. In general, 
results are conflicting, with some studies reporting a positive effect, whereas 
others are not able to record any effect. Major differences in terms of study 
designs and sample size, as well as delivery route, frequency, and duration of 
probiotic consumption, hamper comparison across studies. In addition, most RCTs 
have been performed with a limited sample size using relatively simple methods 
for microbial identification, such as culturing, qPCR, and DNA-DNA checkerboard, 
while high-throughput methods such as 16S sequencing have only been employed in 
a few studies. Currently, state-of-the-art molecular methods such as 
metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics have not yet been used in 
RCTs in the field of probiotics. The present narrative review revealed that the 
effect of probiotic supplements on the oral microbiota remains largely 
uncovered. One important reason is that most RCTs are performed without studying 
the microbiological effect. To facilitate future systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, an internationally agreed core outcome set for the reporting of 
microbial endpoints in clinical trials would be desirable. Such a standardized 
collection of outcomes would most likely improve the quality of probiotic 
research in the oral context.

AIM: This study aimed to compare microbial and inflammatory profiles in 
periodontally/systemically healthy African American (AA) and Caucasian (C) 
individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven C and 46 AA aged from 5 to 25 years were 
evaluated regarding periodontal disease, caries, microbial subgingival profile 
via 16-s sequencing, as well as salivary and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) 
inflammatory profile via multiplex assay.
RESULTS: Greater probing depth percentage was detected in AA (p = .0075), while 
a higher percentage of caries index (p = .0069) and decayed, missing, filled 
teeth (DMFT) index (p = .0089) was observed in C, after adjusting for number of 
teeth, sex and age. Salivary levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα were higher for C, 
whereas GCF levels of eotaxin, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-2 and MIP-1α were higher 
in AA (p < .05). Different microbial profiles were observed between the races 
(p = .02). AA presented higher abundance of periodontopathogens (such as 
Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Filifactor alocis, among others), and 
C presented more caries-associated bacteria (such as Streptococcus mutans and 
Prevotella species). Bacillaceae and Lactobacillus species were associated with 
higher DMFT index, whereas Fusobacterium and Tanerella species with periodontal 
disease parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: A different inflammatory and bacterial profile was observed between 
healthy AA and C, which may predispose these races to higher susceptibility to 
specific oral diseases.

Dental caries is a widespread oral disease that poses a significant medical 
challenge. Traditional caries prevention methods, primarily the application of 
fluoride, often fall short in effectively destroying biofilms and preventing 
enamel demineralization, thereby providing limited efficacy in halting the 
progression of caries over time. To address this issue, we have developed a 
green and cost-effective synergistic strategy for the prevention of dental 
caries. By combining natural sodium phytate and chitosan, we have created 
chitosan-sodium phytate nanoparticles that offer both the antimicrobial 
properties of chitosan and the enamel demineralization-inhibiting capabilities 
of sodium phytate. In an ex vivo biofilm model of human teeth, we found that 
these nanoparticles effectively prevent biofilm buildup and acid damage to the 
mineralized tissue. Additionally, topical treatment of dental caries in rodent 
models has shown that these nanoparticles effectively suppress disease 
progression without negatively impacting oral microbiota diversity or causing 
harm to the gingival-mucosal tissues, unlike traditional prevention methods.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the antineoplastic therapy (AT) as a risk factor for dental 
caries lesions independent of other risk factors such as income, family 
education, stimulated salivary flow rate, hygiene habits, frequency of sugar 
intake, and microbiota in childhood cancer (CC) patients.
METHODS: 72 individuals were divided into CC patients (n=36) and healthy 
individuals (control group - CT n=36). Demographic data, hygiene habits, 
frequency of sugar intake, CC type, and AT were collected. Stimulated salivary 
flow rate was measured and the presence and concentration of Streptococcus 
mutans were assessed using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
technique. Clinical evaluations included plaque index (PI) and 
decayed-missing-filled-teeth index (dmft/DMFT). Descriptive statistics, T-test, 
Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and two-way analysis of 
variance were used for data analysis (p<0.05).
RESULTS: At the time of oral evaluation, both groups exhibited similar ages with 
means of 12.0±3.9 years old for CC and 12.0±4.0 years old for CT patients. All 
CC patients underwent chemotherapy with nine also undergoing radiotherapy. 
Significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of color/race, 
income, family education, and hygiene habits. However, no statistically 
significant differences were found between groups regarding the frequency of 
sugar intake, stimulated salivary flow rate, or the concentration of 
Streptococcus mutans (qPCR technique). For clinical parameters, the DMF 
(CC:1.80, CT: 0.75), decayed (CC: 0.88, CT: 0.19), missing (CC: 0.25, CT:0), and 
PI (CC: 30.5%, CT: 22.6%) were higher in the CC group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer (CC) patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy 
(AT) exhibit a higher prevalence of dental caries, regardless of 
income/education, frequency of sugar intake, stimulated salivary flow rate, and 
microbiota.

Numerous studies have proven the important role of the oral microbiota in health 
and disease. The dysfunctionality of the oral microbiota, known as dysbiosis, is 
incriminated in dental caries, periodontal disease, oral infectious diseases, 
oral cancer, and systemic disease. The lesser-known component of the oral 
microbiota, the mycobiota, is now assiduously investigated. Recent technological 
developments have helped foster the identification of new fungal species based 
on genomic research. Next-generation sequencing has expanded our knowledge about 
the diversity, architecture, and relationships of oral microorganisms within the 
oral cavity. The mycobiome structure and relationships with the bacteriome have 
been studied to identify a mycobiotic signature. This review aimed to emphasize 
the latest knowledge of the oral mycobiome.

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed in two-legs. In the in vivo, we explored the 
potential of a rinse solution containing a combination (Comb) of 0.1 mg/mL 
CaneCPI-5 (sugarcane-derive cystatin), 1.88 × 10- 5M StN15 (statherin-derived 
peptide) and 1.0 mg/mL hemoglobin (Hb) to change the protein profile of the 
acquired enamel pellicle(AEP) and the microbiome of the enamel biofilm. The in 
vitro, was designed to reveal the effects of Comb on the viability and bacterial 
composition of the microcosm biofilm, as well as on enamel demineralization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo study, 10 participants rinsed (10mL,1 min) with 
either deionized water (H2O-control) or Comb. AEP and biofilm were collected 
after 2 and 3 h, respectively, after rinsing. AEP samples underwent proteomics 
analysis, while biofilm microbiome was assessed via 16 S-rRNA Next Generation 
Sequencing(NGS). In vitro study, a microcosm biofilm protocol was employed. 
Ninety-six enamel specimens were treated with: 1)Phosphate-Buffered 
Solution-PBS(negative-control), 2)0.12%Chlorhexidine, 3)500ppmNaF and 4)Comb. 
Resazurin, colony-forming-units(CFU) and Transversal Microradiography(TMR) were 
performed.
RESULTS: The proteomic results revealed higher quantity of proteins in the Comb 
compared to control associated with immune system response and oral microbial 
adhesion. Microbiome showed a significant increase in bacteria linked to a 
healthy microbiota, in the Comb group. In the in vitro study, Comb group was 
only efficient in reducing mineral-loss and lesion-depth compared to the PBS.
CONCLUSIONS: The AEP modification altered the subsequent layers, affecting the 
initial process of bacterial adhesion of pathogenic and commensal bacteria, as 
well as enamel demineralization.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Comb group shows promise in shaping oral health by 
potentially introducing innovative approaches to prevent enamel demineralization 
and deter tooth decay.

The oral cavity harbors complex communities comprising bacteria, archaea, fungi, 
protozoa, and viruses. The oral microbiota is establish at birth and develops 
further during childhood, with early life factors such as birth mode, feeding 
practices, and oral hygiene, reported to influence this development and the 
susceptibility to caries. We here analyzed the oral bacterial composition in 
saliva of 260 Swedish children at two, three and five years of age using 16S 
rRNA gene profiling to examine its relation to environmental factors and caries 
development at five years of age. We were able to assign the salivary bacterial 
community in each child at each time point to one of seven distinct clusters. We 
observed an individual dynamic in the development of the oral microbiota related 
to early life factors, such as being first born, born by C-section, maternal 
perinatal antibiotics use, with a distinct transition between three and five 
years of age. Different bacterial signatures depending on age were related to 
increased caries risk, while Peptococcus consistently linked to reduced risk of 
caries development.

OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease with 
unknown etiology that is considered to be related to environmental and genetic 
factors. The aim of this study was to clarify the oral microflora 
characteristics of pSS patients and to reveal the connection between oral 
bacterial composition and dental caries using a high-throughput sequencing 
technique.
METHODS: Thirty-five pSS patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in this 
study. We collected saliva and plaque samples from pSS patients and saliva 
samples from healthy controls. We used 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) 
high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region to determine 
the composition and structure of the microbiota in the three sample sets. 
Finally, bioinformatics analyses, including the diversity of the microbiota, 
species differences, and functional prediction were performed.
RESULTS: In the alpha diversity and beta diversity analysis, the Chao1 
(P < 0.01), observed species (P < 0.01), and PD whole tree indices (P < 0.01) 
were significantly lower in the saliva and plaque samples of pSS patients than 
in the saliva samples of healthy controls, but the Shannon (P < 0.01) and 
Simpson indices (P < 0.01) were significantly higher in the healthy controls, 
and their total diversity significantly differed. In the main flora composition 
at the genus level (top 10), we identified Prevotella and Veillonella as more 
enriched in the saliva of pSS patients and Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, and 
Leptotrichia as more enriched in the plaque of pSS patients. Predictive 
functional analysis showed that the oral microbiota of pSS patients was related 
to translation, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and nucleotide metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: The oral microbial ecology of patients with pSS is dysregulated, 
resulting in a decrease in overall diversity. Prevotella and Veillonella may be 
related to pSS, while Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, and Leptotrichia may be 
related to dental caries in pSS patients. Key Points • This study revealed 
differences in the oral microbial composition of patients with pSS compared to 
healthy controls. • We included a plaque group of pSS patients to identify the 
microbiota related to pSS and dental caries. • Prevotella and Veillonella may 
contribute to pSS, and Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, and Leptotrichia are 
associated with dental caries in pSS patients.

Oral microecological dysregulation has been shown to be associated with various 
immune system disorders. Henoch-schonlein purpura (HSP) is an autoimmune small 
vessel inflammatory disease in children of uncertain etiology, and studies have 
suggested that streptococcal infection may be an influential factor in its 
development. However, the relationship between oral microecological 
dysregulation and HSP has not been clearly studied so far. In this study, an 
epidemiological survey on the oral health status of children with HSP was 
investigated in this paper, and collected dental plaque from four groups of 
children for 16SrDNA high-throughput sequencing to analyze the composition and 
changes of oral microbial diversity among different groups. The results showed 
that the oral health status of children with HSP was poor, except for the 
incidence of caries in the 5-year-old group, the caries rate and dmfs/DMFS in 
the 3,4 and 5-year-old groups were higher than the same age in the fourth 
Chinese Oral Health Epidemiological Survey. Moreover, the development of HSP is 
accompanied by disturbances in the oral microbiota; a decrease in the number of 
Firmicutes which producing butyric acid may be closely associated with the 
development of HSP; changes in the abundance of Streptococcus and Neisseria may 
be a risk factor for the development of HSP.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of the oral microbiota and the 
relationship of the dental caries and periodontal status in patients aged 0 to 
18 years with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (CLP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. 
Five databases were consulted, including publications in English, Spanish and 
Portuguese. The evaluations of the quality of the observational studies and the 
experimental studies were carried out with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and 
CONSORT guidelines, respectively. The risk of bias of the studies was determined 
using Rev Manager 5.4, and 5 publications were meta-analyzed.
RESULTS: The cariogenic microbiota of children and adolescents with cleft lip 
and palate was similar to that of children without clefts, although with higher 
counts of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. The periodontopathogenic 
microbiota was related to the presence of Campylobacter spp, Fusobacterium spp, 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Parvimonas micra and 
Porphyromonas gingivalis, considered microorganisms with high pathogenic 
capacity. Heterogeneity was shown in relation to the microbiota and the type of 
fissure, presenting numerous microorganisms associated with the pre- and 
post-surgical condition (cheilorrhaphy and palatorrhaphy) such as Staphylococcus 
aureus, Streptococcus beta hemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella 
oxytoca, Moraxella catarrhalis, Candida spp, Candida albicans, Candida krusei 
and Candida tropicalis. The meta-analysis revealed that patients with cleft lip 
and palate were 2.03 times more likely to have caries than the control group 
(p<0.005).
CONCLUSION: In the microbiota, there was a great diversity of microorganisms 
that can vary according to the type of fissure and surgical interventions 
predisposing patients to a greater probability of dental caries, it is important 
to take into account the technique used to describe the oral microbiota in order 
to be able to compare the different studies.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Studying the microbiota and the relationship of dental 
caries and periodontal status in children and adolescents with cleft lip and 
palate can facilitate the comprehensive care of patients with these conditions.

In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate the specific oral pathogens 
potentially associated with the mobile microbiome in children with congenital 
heart disease (CHD). Caries, oral hygiene and gingival indices were evaluated in 
20 children with CHD and a healthy control group, and venous blood samples and 
saliva were collected. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 
blood samples were analyzed for the presence of bacterial DNA to determine the 
mobile microbiome, and saliva samples were analyzed to identify and quantify 
target microorganisms, including Streptococcus mutans (Sm) and its serotype k 
(Smk), Fusobacterium. nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Scardovia 
wiggsiae (Sw) and Aggregitibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and its JP2 clone 
(JP2). The findings were analyzed by Mann Whitney U, chi-square, Fisher's exact 
and Spearman's Correlation tests. Bacterial DNA was identified in two blood 
samples. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the 
presence and counts of bacteria in saliva. However, the CHD group exhibited 
significantly lower caries and higher gingival index scores than the control 
group. The presence of Pg and Aa were significantly associated with higher 
gingival index scores. Sm and Smk counts were significantly correlated with 
caries experience. A positive correlation was found between Fn and total 
bacteria counts. In conclusion, the mobile microbiome, which has been proposed 
as a potential marker of dysbiosis at distant sites, was very rare in our 
pediatric population. The counts of target microorganisms which are potentially 
associated with the mobile microbiome did not differ in children with CHD and 
healthy children.

Saliva is a readily accessible and inexpensive biological specimen that enables 
investigation of the oral microbiome, which can serve as a biomarker of oral and 
systemic health. There are two routine approaches to collect saliva, stimulated 
and unstimulated; however, there is no consensus on how sampling method 
influences oral microbiome metrics. In this study, we analyzed paired saliva 
samples (unstimulated and stimulated) from 88 individuals, aged 7-18 years. 
Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we investigated the differences in bacterial 
microbiome composition between sample types and determined how sampling method 
affects the distribution of taxa associated with untreated dental caries and 
gingivitis. Our analyses indicated significant differences in microbiome 
composition between the sample types. Both sampling methods were able to detect 
significant differences in microbiome composition between healthy subjects and 
subjects with untreated caries. However, only stimulated saliva revealed a 
significant association between microbiome diversity and composition in 
individuals with diagnosed gingivitis. Furthermore, taxa previously associated 
with dental caries and gingivitis were preferentially enriched in individuals 
with each respective disease only in stimulated saliva. Our study suggests that 
stimulated saliva provides a more nuanced readout of microbiome composition and 
taxa distribution associated with untreated dental caries and gingivitis 
compared to unstimulated saliva.

The microbiota in the oral cavity has a strict connection to its host. Its 
imbalance may determine oral diseases and can also have an impact on the 
systemic health. Probiotic strains may help in the restoration of a balanced 
condition. For this purpose, we screened the antibacterial and antiadhesive 
activities of many viable probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus PBS066, 
Lactobacillus crispatus LCR030, Lactobacillus gasseri LG050, Lactiplantibacillus 
plantarum PBS067, Limosilactobacillus reuteri PBS072, Lacticaseibacillus 
rhamnosus LRH020, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL050, 
Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC 1101, L. paracasei LPC 1082, and L. paracasei 
LPC 1114) against two main oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans and 
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, involved in dental caries and periodontal 
disease development and progression. Considering both the agar overlay 
preventive and treatment models, seven probiotics determined greater inhibition 
zones against the tested pathogens. This behavior was further analyzed by the 
plate count method and scanning electron microscope imaging. L. plantarum 
PBS067, L. rhamnosus LRH020, L. paracasei LPC 1101, L. paracasei LPC 1082, and 
L. paracasei LPC 1114 prevent the growth and adhesion of oral pathogens in a 
strain-specific manner (p < 0.0001). These probiotics might be considered as an 
alternative effective adjuvant to improve oral and systemic well-being for 
future personalized treatments.

The oral cavity harbors a diverse and dynamic bacterial biofilm community which 
is pivotal to oral health maintenance and, if turning dysbiotic, can contribute 
to various diseases. Glycans as unsurpassed carriers of biological information 
are participating in underlying processes that shape oral health and disease. 
Bacterial glycoinfrastructure-encompassing compounds as diverse as 
glycoproteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), cell wall glycopolymers, and 
exopolysaccharides-is well known to influence bacterial fitness, with direct 
effects on bacterial physiology, immunogenicity, lifestyle, and interaction and 
colonization capabilities. Thus, understanding oral bacterias' 
glycoinfrastructure and encoded glycolanguage is key to elucidating their 
pathogenicity mechanisms and developing targeted strategies for therapeutic 
intervention. Driven by their known immunological role, most research in oral 
glycobiology has been directed onto LPSs, whereas, recently, glycoproteins have 
been gaining increased interest. This review draws a multifaceted picture of the 
glycolanguage, with a focus on glycoproteins, manifested in prominent oral 
bacteria, such as streptococci, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, 
and Fusobacterium nucleatum. We first define the characteristics of the 
different glycoconjugate classes and then summarize the current status of 
knowledge of the structural diversity of glycoconjugates produced by oral 
bacteria, describe governing biosynthetic pathways, and list biological roles of 
these energetically costly compounds. Additionally, we highlight emerging 
research on the unraveling impact of oral glycoinfrastructure on dental caries, 
periodontitis, and systemic conditions. By integrating current knowledge and 
identifying knowledge gaps, this review underscores the importance of studying 
the glycolanguage oral bacteria speak to advance our understanding of oral 
microbiology and develop novel antimicrobials.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the composition of the oral 
microbial flora of adults with rampant caries in China to provide guidance for 
treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty human salivary and supragingival plaque samples were 
collected. They were characterized into four groups: patients with rampant 
caries with Sjogren's syndrome (RC-SS) or high-sugar diet (RC-HD), common dental 
caries (DC), and healthy individuals (HP). The 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of the 
bacterial DNA was detected by Illumina sequencing. PCoA based on OTU with 
Bray-Curtis algorithm, the abundance of each level, LEfSe analysis, network 
analysis, and PICRUSt analysis were carried out between the four groups and two 
sample types. Clinical and demographic data were compared using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) or the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test, depending on 
the normality of the data, using GraphPad Prism 8 (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: OTU principal component analysis revealed a significant difference 
between healthy individuals and those with RC-SS. In the saliva of patients with 
rampant caries, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased significantly at 
the phylum level. Further, Streptocpccus, Veillonella, Prevotella, and Dialister 
increased, while Neisseria and Haemophilus decreased at the genus level. 
Veillonella increased in the plaque samples of patients with rampant caries.
CONCLUSION: Both salivary and dental plaque composition were significantly 
different between healthy individuals and patients with rampant caries. This 
study provides a microbiological basis for exploring the etiology of rampant 
caries.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides basic information on the flora of the 
oral cavity in adults with rampant caries in China. These findings could serve 
as a reference for the treatment of this disease.

BACKGROUND: The oral microbiome is a complex and dynamic assemblage of 
microorganisms that colonize different sites of the oral cavity maintaining both 
oral and systemic health. Therefore, when its composition is altered, oral 
diseases occur. Among oral inflammatory pathologies, periodontal diseases affect 
the tissues surrounding the teeth, representing the main cause of tooth loss and 
one of the most important threats to the oral health. Lifestyle and eating 
habits influence the composition of the human oral microbiota and the 
development and progression of oral diseases. In this context, the Mediterranean 
Diet (MD) model, comprising both healthy dietary choices and lifestyle, is 
linked to the prevention of several metabolic and chronic-degenerative 
pathological processes, including oral diseases. Indeed, the MD is a plant-based 
diet, enriched of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutrients, which may induce 
beneficial effects against dental caries and periodontal diseases.
AIM: This review summarizes the role of the oral microbiome in the development 
of the oral diseases and the potential of MD in modulating the oral microbiome 
leading to implications for oral health.
CONCLUSIONS: The data collected highlight the need to promote the MD pattern 
along with the correct hygiene habits to prevent the development of oral 
diseases.

Plain Language Summary: The oral microbiome is a complex and dynamic assemblage

Streptococci are primary colonizers of the oral cavity where they are 
ubiquitously present and an integral part of the commensal oral biofilm 
microflora. The role oral streptococci play in the interaction with the host is 
ambivalent. On the one hand, they function as gatekeepers of homeostasis and are 
a prerequisite for the maintenance of oral health - they shape the oral 
microbiota, modulate the immune system to enable bacterial survival, and 
antagonize pathogenic species. On the other hand, also recognized pathogens, 
such as oral Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, which trigger the 
onset of dental caries belong to the genus Streptococcus. In the context of 
periodontitis, oral streptococci as excellent initial biofilm formers have an 
accessory function, enabling late biofilm colonizers to inhabit gingival pockets 
and cause disease. The pathogenic potential of oral streptococci fully unfolds 
when their dissemination into the bloodstream occurs; streptococcal infection 
can cause extra-oral diseases, such as infective endocarditis and hemorrhagic 
stroke. In this review, the taxonomic diversity of oral streptococci, their role 
and prevalence in the oral cavity and their contribution to oral health and 
disease will be discussed, focusing on the virulence factors these species 
employ for interactions at the host interface.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge on the 
association between the oral microbiota and dental caries in adolescents.
DESIGN: An electronic search was carried out across five databases. Studies were 
included if they conducted research on generally healthy adolescents, applied 
molecular-based microbiological analyses and assessed caries status. Data 
extraction was performed by two reviewers and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was 
applied for quality assessment.
RESULTS: In total, 3935 records were reviewed which resulted in a selection of 
20 cross-sectional studies (published 2005-2022) with a sample size ranging from 
11 to 614 participants including adolescents between 11 and 19 years. The 
studies analyzed saliva, dental biofilm or tongue swabs with Checkerboard 
DNA-DNA hybridization, (q)PCR or Next-Generation Sequencing methods. Prevotella 
denticola, Scardoviae Wiggsiae, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus mutans 
were the most frequently reported species presenting higher abundance in 
adolescents with caries. The majority of the studies reported that the microbial 
diversity was similar between participants with and without dental caries.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review is the first that shows how the oral 
microbiota composition in adolescents appears to differ between those with and 
without dental caries, suggesting certain taxa may be associated with increased 
caries risk. However, there is a need to replicate and expand these findings in 
larger, longitudinal studies that also focus on caries severity and take 
adolescent-specific factors into account.

Globally, oral diseases affect nearly 3.5 billion people, accounting for 4.6% of 
the healthcare expenditure. Common oral diseases include dental caries and 
periodontal disease, associated with biofilms formed by cariogenic pathogens. 
Epidemiological studies associate carbohydrates with these diseases due to 
 the sugars metabolized by cariogenic pathogens. This review focuses on dental 
caries and periodontal pathogens, quorum sensing, lectin-carbohydrate 
interactions, and various sugar molecules. Cariogenic sugars significantly 
influence biofilms by enhancing pathogen adhesion, viability, and gene 
expressions associated with biofilm formation. Moreover, lectin-carbohydrate 
interactions contribute to biofilm stability. Disrupting these interactions is a 
potential strategy for oral disease prevention. The use of nanoparticles, such 
as quantum dots, provides novel insights into lectin-sugar interactions and the 
development of inhibitors. Additionally, nanomaterials like calcium phosphate 
nanoparticles neutralize acids and inhibit microbial growth. This overview 
emphasizes understanding the relationships between oral diseases, microbial 
communities, and sugars to devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against 
oral diseases.

Arginine catabolism by the bacterial arginine deiminase system (ADS) has 
anticariogenic properties through the production of ammonia, which modulates the 
pH of the oral environment. Given the potential protective capacity of the ADS 
pathway, the exploitation of ADS-competent oral microbes through pre- or 
probiotic applications is a promising therapeutic target to prevent tooth decay. 
To date, most investigations of the ADS in the oral cavity and its relation to 
caries have focused on indirect measures of activity or on specific bacterial 
groups, yet the pervasiveness and rate of expression of the ADS operon in 
diverse mixed microbial communities in oral health and disease remain an open 
question. Here, we use a multivariate approach, combining ultra-deep 
metatranscriptomic sequencing with paired metataxonomic and in vitro citrulline 
quantification to characterize the microbial community and ADS operon expression 
in healthy and late-stage cavitated teeth. While ADS activity is higher in 
healthy teeth, we identify multiple bacterial lineages with upregulated ADS 
activity on cavitated teeth that are distinct from those found on healthy teeth 
using both reference-based mapping and de novo assembly methods. Our dual 
metataxonomic and metatranscriptomic approach demonstrates the importance of 
species abundance for gene expression data interpretation and that patterns of 
differential expression can be skewed by low-abundance groups. Finally, we 
identify several potential candidate probiotic bacterial lineages within species 
that may be useful therapeutic targets for the prevention of tooth decay and 
propose that the development of a strain-specific, mixed-microbial probiotic may 
be a beneficial approach given the heterogeneity of taxa identified here across 
health groups.
IMPORTANCE: Tooth decay is the most common preventable chronic disease, 
affecting more than two billion people globally. The development of caries on 
teeth is primarily a consequence of acid production by cariogenic bacteria that 
inhabit the plaque microbiome. Other bacterial strains in the oral cavity may 
suppress or prevent tooth decay by producing ammonia as a byproduct of the 
arginine deiminase metabolic pathway, increasing the pH of the plaque biofilm. 
While the benefits of arginine metabolism on oral health have been extensively 
documented in specific bacterial groups, the prevalence and consistency of 
arginine deiminase system (ADS) activity among oral bacteria in a community 
context remain an open question. In the current study, we use a multi-omics 
approach to document the pervasiveness of the expression of the ADS operon in 
both health and disease to better understand the conditions in which ADS 
activity may prevent tooth decay.

Dental caries, a highly prevalent oral disease, impacts a significant portion of 
the global population. Conventional approaches that indiscriminately eradicate 
microbes disrupt the natural equilibrium of the oral microbiota. In contrast, 
biointervention strategies aim to restore this balance by introducing beneficial 
microorganisms or inhibiting cariogenic ones. Over the past three decades, 
microbial preparations have garnered considerable attention in dental research 
for the prevention and treatment of dental caries. However, unlike related 
pathologies in the gastrointestinal, vaginal, and respiratory tracts, dental 
caries occurs on hard tissues such as tooth enamel and is closely associated 
with localized acid overproduction facilitated by cariogenic biofilms. 
Therefore, it is insufficient to rely solely on previous mechanisms to delineate 
the role of microbial preparations in the oral cavity. A more comprehensive 
perspective should involve considering the concepts of cariogenic biofilms. This 
review elucidates the latest research progress, mechanisms of action, 
challenges, and future research directions regarding probiotics, prebiotics, 
synbiotics, and postbiotics for the prevention and treatment of dental caries, 
taking into account the unique pathogenic mechanisms of dental caries. With an 
enhanced understanding of oral microbiota, personalized microbial therapy will 
emerge as a critical future research trend.

School, University of Adelaide, South Australia 5005, AUSTRALIA.

Over 700 oral bacterial species have been identified in human populations, with 
~200 bacterial species identified in any given individual mouth. The 
relationship between the oral microbiome and health is evidenced in many 
studies, with dysbiosis (a shift from a healthy to less healthy state of 
microbial community) associated with dental caries, periodontitis, halitosis and 
oral cancer. However, oral microbiome research to date has focused primarily on 
European populations, particularly those in large urban centres housing academic 
institutions with access to research funding. Key anthropological perspectives 
examining the sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic and environmental factors 
that influence the oral microbiome have also been Euro-centric. Very little is 
known about how the oral microbiome mediates both oral and general disease risks 
specifically within Indigenous and other vulnerable populations. Undertaking 
oral microbiome research in under-served communities requires consideration of 
many issues often unfamiliar in the broader research community, including being 
acceptable, relevant and of perceived benefit to the communities being studied. 
Research materials need to be managed respectfully in a culturally safe way, 
sharing/translating the knowledge obtained. These approaches will likely provide 
unique insights into the complex connections between environment and biology, 
people and place, and culture and science in relation to the oral microbiome. 
The ongoing development of oral microbiome research must facilitate frameworks 
that are equitable and inclusive to better enable clinical and scientific 
expertise within marginalised communities.

Chronic oral diseases, such as caries and periodontal disease, may, in future, 
be treated by oral microbiome transplant (OMT) technology. OMT therapy would 
involve collecting a donor oral microbiome and transplanting into a recipient to 
either prevent or treat oral diseases linked to a change (i.e., dysbiosis) in 
the oral microbiome. Given the great promise of this technology, we must 
consider the ethical and practical implications of how it is developed to 
maximise its accessibility and affordability. Here, we examine ways that OMT 
technology might be commercialized in the context of equity and accessibility in 
both clinical or do-it-yourself settings. We do this while assuming that the 
technology can be developed for humans in ways that are safe and effective at 
the individual and population-levels. We highlight the need for OMT therapy to 
be 1) cost-effective, 2) understood by end users and clinicians, 3) easy to 
access even in rural or remote communities, and 4) providing donors equitable 
compensation for their microbiomes. These key elements will only be achieved 
through partnerships between scientists, clinicians, investors and stakeholders 
throughout development. Therefore, proper acknowledgement and equitable 
evaluation of contributions in this team will also be critical to ensuring that 
this technology can be globally accessed. While OMT is likely to reshape how we 
prevent or treat oral disease, consciously guiding its development toward equity 
and accessibility to all people may significantly aid in improving health for 
those without access to dental care.

Oral streptococci, key players in oral biofilm formation, are implicated in oral 
dysbiosis and various clinical conditions, including dental caries, gingivitis, 
periodontal disease, and oral cancer. Specifically, Streptococcus anginosus is 
associated with esophageal, gastric, and pharyngeal cancers, while Streptococcus 
mitis is linked to oral cancer. However, no study has investigated the 
mechanistic links between these Streptococcus species and cancer-related 
inflammatory responses. As an initial step, we probed the innate immune response 
triggered by S. anginosus and S. mitis in RAW264.7 macrophages. These bacteria 
exerted time- and dose-dependent effects on macrophage morphology without 
affecting cell viability. Compared with untreated macrophages, macrophages 
infected with S. anginosus exhibited a robust proinflammatory response 
characterized by significantly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and 
mediators, including TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, NOS2, and COX2, accompanied by enhanced 
NF-κB activation. In contrast, S. mitis-infected macrophages failed to elicit a 
robust inflammatory response. Seahorse Xfe96 analysis revealed an increased 
extracellular acidification rate in macrophages infected with S. anginosus 
compared with S. mitis. At the 24-h time point, the presence of S. anginosus led 
to reduced extracellular itaconate, while S. mitis triggered increased itaconate 
levels, highlighting distinct metabolic profiles in macrophages during infection 
in contrast to aconitate decarboxylase expression observed at the 6-h time 
point. This initial investigation highlights how S. anginosus and S. mitis, two 
Gram-positive bacteria from the same genus, can prompt distinct immune responses 
and metabolic shifts in macrophages during infection.IMPORTANCEThe surge in head 
and neck cancer cases among individuals devoid of typical risk factors such as 
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection and tobacco and alcohol use sparks an 
argumentative discussion around the emerging role of oral microbiota as a novel 
risk factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). While substantial research 
has dissected the gut microbiome's influence on physiology, the oral microbiome, 
notably oral streptococci, has been underappreciated during mucosal 
immunopathogenesis. Streptococcus anginosus, a viridans streptococci group, has 
been linked to abscess formation and an elevated presence in esophageal cancer 
and OSCC. The current study aims to probe the innate immune response to S. 
anginosus compared with the early colonizer Streptococcus mitis as an important 
first step toward understanding the impact of distinct oral Streptococcus 
species on the host immune response, which is an understudied determinant of 
OSCC development and progression.

BACKGROUNDS: The pathogenic microorganisms and clinical manifestations of caries 
and periodontitis are different, caries and periodontitis are usually discussed 
separately, and the relationship between them is ignored. Clinically, patients 
prone to dental caries generally have a healthier periodontal status, whereas 
patients with periodontitis generally have a lower incidence of dental caries. 
The relationship between dental caries and periodontitis remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explain the clinical phenomenon of antagonism 
between dental caries and periodontitis by exploring the ecological chain and 
bacterial interactions in dental caries, periodontitis, and other comorbid 
diseases.
METHODS: The dental plaque microbiomes of 30 patients with oral diseases (10 
each with caries, periodontitis, and comorbid diseases) were sequenced and 
analysed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) database was used for a differential functional analysis of 
dental plaque microbial communities in caries, periodontitis, and comorbid 
diseases.
RESULTS: The coinfection group had the greatest bacterial richness in dental 
plaque. The principal coordinate analysis showed that caries and periodontitis 
were separate from each other, and comorbid diseases were located at the overlap 
of caries and periodontitis, with most of them being periodontitis. 
Simultaneously, we compared the microbiomes with significant differences among 
the three groups and the correlations between the microbiome samples. In 
addition, KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant differences in functional 
changes among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the composition of the dental plaque microbial 
communities in caries, periodontitis, and comorbidities and the differences 
among the three. Additionally, we identified a possible antagonism between 
periodontitis and caries. We identified a new treatment strategy for the 
prediction and diagnosis of caries and periodontitis.

Dental caries is a significant oral and public health problem worldwide, 
especially in low-income populations. The risk of dental caries increases with 
frequent intake of dietary carbohydrates, including sugars, leading to increased 
acidity and disruption of the symbiotic diverse and complex microbial community 
of health. Excess acid production leads to a dysbiotic shift in the bacterial 
biofilm composition, demineralization of tooth structure, and cavities. Highly 
acidic and acid-tolerant species associated with caries include Streptococcus 
mutans, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, and Scardovia species. The 
differences in microbiotas depend on tooth site, extent of carious lesions, and 
rate of disease progression. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics not only 
reveal the structure and genetic potential of the caries-associated microbiome, 
but, more importantly, capture the genetic makeup of the metabolically active 
microbiome in lesion sites. Due to its multifactorial nature, caries has been 
difficult to prevent. The use of topical fluoride has had a significant impact 
on reducing caries in clinical settings, but the approach is costly; the results 
are less sustainable for high-caries-risk individuals, especially children. 
Developing treatment regimens that specifically target S. mutans and other 
acidogenic bacteria, such as using nanoparticles, show promise in altering the 
cariogenic microbiome, thereby combatting the disease.

The rising demand for novel antibiotic agents prompts an investigation into 
natural resources, notably plant-derived compounds. In this study, various 
extracts (aqueous, ethanolic, aqueous-ethanolic, and enzymatic) of Rosa 
damascena and Hypericum perforatum were systematically evaluated against 
bacterial strains isolated from dental lesions (n = 6) and food sources (raw 
milk and broiler carcass, n = 2). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), 
minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), antibiofilm activity, and time-kill 
kinetics were assessed across a range of extract concentrations, revealing a 
dose-responsive effect. Notably, some extracts exhibited superior antibacterial 
efficacy compared to standard clinical antibiotics, and the time-kill kinetics 
demonstrated a rapid elimination of bacterial loads within 24 h. The 
susceptibility pattern proved strain-specific, contingent upon the extract type, 
yet all tested pathogens exhibited sensitivity. The identified extracts, rich in 
phenolic and polyphenolic compounds, as well as other antioxidant properties, 
contributed to their remarkable antibiotic effects. This comprehensive 
investigation not only highlights the potential of Rosa damascena and Hypericum 
perforatum extracts as potent antibacterial agents against diverse bacterial 
strains including caries pathogens, but also underscores their rapid action and 
dose-dependent efficacy. The findings suggest a promising avenue for harnessing 
plant-derived compounds in the development of novel antimicrobial strategies 
against dental caries and other oral inflammations, bridging the gap between 
natural resources and antibiotic discovery.

BACKGROUND: Children affected by severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) usually 
need comprehensive caries treatment due to the extensive of caries. How the oral 
microbiome changes after caries therapy within the short-term warrant further 
study.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate the short-term impact of comprehensive 
caries treatment on the supragingival plaque microbiome of S-ECC children.
DESIGN: Thirty-three children aged 2-4 years with severe caries (dt > 7) were 
recruited. Comprehensive caries treatment was performed under general anesthesia 
in one session and included restoration, pulp treatment, extraction, and 
fluoride application. Supragingival plaque was sampled pre- and 1-month 
posttreatment. The genomic DNA of the supragingival plaque was extracted, and 
bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed.
RESULTS: Our data showed that the microbial community evenness significantly 
decreased posttreatment. Furthermore, comprehensive caries treatment led to more 
diverse microbial structures among the subjects. The interbacterial interactions 
reflected by the microbial community's co-occurrence network tended to be less 
complex posttreatment. Caries treatment increased the relative abundance of 
Corynebacterium matruchotii, Corynebacterium durum, Actinomyces naeslundii, and 
Saccharibacteria HMT-347, as well as Aggregatibacter HMT-458 and Haemophilus 
influenzae. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Streptococcus mutans, three 
species from Leptotrichia, Neisseria bacilliformis, and Provotella pallens 
significantly decreased posttreatment.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that comprehensive caries treatment may 
contribute to the reconstruction of a healthier supragingival microbiome.

INTRODUCTION: Eggerthia catenaformis, a non-spore-forming anaerobic 
Gram-positive bacillus component of the human fecal microbiota has rarely been 
reported in human diseases. In almost every case described in current literature 
to date, dental diseases (abscesses, periodontitis, or caries), are the most 
common source of the infection which extends to the brain, cervical spaces, 
pulmonary parenchyma, the pleural cavity, the abdominal wall, and the abdominal 
cavity.
CASE REPORT: An 82-year-old male Caucasian patient was admitted to our Emergency 
Department (ED) with a painless, right submandibular mass, dyspnea, and 
inspiratory stridor. A CT scan of the head, neck, and chest with intravenous 
contrast material revealed a retrotonsillar fluid collection. Air bubbles and 
minimal fluid were present from the right sub-mandibular area to the lower 
mediastinum between the spine, the descending thoracic aorta, and the trachea. 
The patient underwent surgical treatment and a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The 
retropharyngeal fluid collection culture showed the presence of Eggerthia 
catenaformis. After a first period in the Intensive Care Unit, he was admitted 
to a Step-Down Unit (SDU) where he underwent respiratory weaning, motor 
rehabilitation, and gradual oral feeding resumption. At discharge, the patient 
maintained the tracheal cannula as he still had impaired swallowing of solid 
foods.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first case of descending necrotizing 
mediastinitis in a patient with a retropharyngeal abscess, in the absence of 
dental diseases.

BACKGROUND: Saliva, an oral secretion is considered an essential biological 
modulator involved in maintaining oral homeostasis. Increased glucose levels in 
diabetic patients' saliva may have an impact on diversity of microbes. Comparing 
the salivary microflora of diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts will help in 
diagnosis and risk assessment of oral health complications. This will provide 
greater knowledge about the contribution of oral microbes to the development of 
oral illnesses. The association between salivary microbiota and diabetic state 
is less explored in the North Indian population, hence current observational 
study was performed to analyze the salivary microflora of diabetic and 
non-diabetic individuals using metagenomic analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center non-randomized observational trial was 
conducted in Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants were enrolled into either 
diabetic (n = 68) or non-diabetic groups (n = 68) based on their diabetes 
status. Following saliva collection, DNA was extracted and metagenomic 
sequencing was performed.
RESULTS: Phylum Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were significantly abundant in 
diabetic individuals (p < 0.0001), while Proteobacteria was significantly higher 
among non-diabetic individuals (p < 0.0001). No statistical difference in phylum 
Actinobacteria and Firmicutes among diabetics and non-diabetics. Veillonella, 
Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Leptotrichia, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus were 
greater in diabetics whereas the abundance of Capnocytophaga and Neisseria was 
more among non-diabetics (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The genera Veillonella, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Leptotrichia, 
Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus were comparatively over the odds with the 
diabetics in India. The association between microbiota in diabetic population 
and risk related to increase in occurrence of caries, gingivitis, and 
periodontitis in diabetic population prevalence should be investigated.

OBJECTIVES: To review the application of omics technologies in the field of 
cariology research and provide critical insights into the emerging opportunities 
and challenges.
DATA & SOURCES: Publications on the application of omics technologies in 
cariology research up to December 2022 were sourced from online databases, 
including PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Two independent reviewers assessed 
the relevance of the publications to the objective of this review.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that employed omics technologies to investigate dental 
caries were selected from the initial pool of identified publications. A total 
of 922 publications with one or more omics technologies adopted were included 
for comprehensive bibliographic analysis. (Meta)genomics (676/922, 73 %) is the 
predominant omics technology applied for cariology research in the included 
studies. Other applied omics technologies are metabolomics (108/922, 12 %), 
proteomics (105/922, 11 %), and transcriptomics (76/922, 8 %).
CONCLUSION: This study identified an emerging trend in the application of 
multiple omics technologies in cariology research. Omics technologies possess 
significant potential in developing strategies for the detection, staging 
evaluation, risk assessment, prevention, and management of dental caries. 
Despite the numerous challenges that lie ahead, the integration of multi-omics 
data obtained from individual biological samples, in conjunction with artificial 
intelligence technology, may offer potential avenues for further exploration in 
caries research.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review presented a comprehensive overview of the 
application of omics technologies in cariology research and discussed the 
advantages and challenges of using these methods to detect, assess, predict, 
prevent, and treat dental caries. It contributes to steering research for 
improved understanding of dental caries and advancing clinical translation of

BACKGROUND: The focal infection theory has been used to explain several chronic 
systemic diseases in the past. Systemic diseases were thought to be caused by 
focal infections, such as caries and periodontal diseases, and dentists were 
held responsible for these diseases due to the spread of oral infections. As 
knowledge of the interrelationship between oral microorganisms and the host 
immune response has evolved over the last few decades, the focal infection 
theory has been modified in various ways. The relationship between oral and 
systemic health appears to be more complex than that suggested by the classical 
theory of focal infections. Indeed, the contribution of the oral microbiota to 
some systemic diseases is gaining acceptance, as there are strong associations 
between periodontal disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, and 
hospital-associated pneumonia, amongst others. As many jurisdictions have 
various protocols for managing this oral-systemic axis of disease, we sought to 
provide a consensus on this notion with the help of a multidisciplinary team 
from the Czech Republic.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary team comprising physicians/surgeons in the 
specialities of dentistry, ear-nose and throat (ENT), cardiology, orthopaedics, 
oncology, and diabetology were quetioned with regard to their conceptual 
understanding of the focal infection theory particularly in relation to the 
oral-systemic axis. The team also established a protocol to determine the 
strength of these associations and to plan the therapeutic steps needed to treat 
focal odontogenic infections whenever possible.
RESULTS: Scoring algorithms were devised for odontogenic inflammatory diseases 
and systemic risks, and standardised procedures were developed for general use.
CONCLUSIONS: The designed algorithm of the oral-systemic axis will be helpful 
for all health care workers in guiding their patient management protocol.

The oral cavity is the second most microbially rich region of the human body, 
and many studies have shown that there is a strong association between 
microorganisms and oral health. Some pathogenic bacteria produce biofilms and 
harmful metabolites in the mouth that may cause oral problems such as oral 
malodor, periodontitis, and dental caries. Altering the oral microbiota by using 
probiotics may alleviate oral health problems. Thus, using multi-function 
screening, we aimed to identify probiotics that can significantly improve oral 
health. The main parameters were the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria growth, 
inhibition of biofilm formation, reduction in the production of indole, H2S, and 
NH3 metabolites that cause halitosis, increase in the production of H2O2 to 
combat harmful bacteria, and co-aggregation with pathogens to prevent their 
adhesion and colonization in the oral cavity. Tolerance to cholic acid and 
choline was also assessed. Bifidobacterium animalis ZK-77, Lactobacillus 
salivarius ZK-88, and Streptococcus salivarius ZK-102 had antibacterial activity 
and inhibited biofilm production to prevent caries. They also improved the oral 
malodor parameter, H2S, NH3, and indole production. The selected probiotics 
(especially L. salivarius ZK-88) alleviated the inflammation in the oral cavity 
of rats with periodontitis. The analysis of the gingival crevicular fluid 
microbiome after probiotic intervention showed that B. animalis ZK-77 likely 
helped to restore the oral microbiota and maintain the oral microecology. Next, 
we determined the best prebiotics for each candidate probiotic in order to 
obtain a formulation with improved effects. We then verified that a 
probiotics/prebiotic combination (B. animalis ZK-77, L. salivarius ZK-88, and 
fructooligosaccharides) significantly improved halitosis and teeth color in 
cats. Using whole-genome sequencing and acute toxicity mouse experiments 
involving the two probiotics, we found that neither probiotic had virulence 
genes and they had no significant effects on the growth or development of mice, 
indicating their safety. Taking the results together, B. animalis ZK-77 and L. 
salivarius ZK-88 can improve oral health, as verified by in vivo and in vitro 
experiments. This study provides a reference for clinical research and also 
provides new evidence for the oral health benefits of probiotics.

BACKGROUND: Oral microbiome sequencing has revealed key links between microbiome 
dysfunction and dental caries. However, these efforts have largely focused on 
Western populations, with few studies on the Middle Eastern communities. The 
current study aimed to identify the composition and abundance of the oral 
microbiota in saliva samples of children with different caries levels using 
machine learning approaches.
METHODS: Oral microbiota composition and abundance were identified in 250 Saudi 
participants with high dental caries and 150 with low dental caries using 16 S 
rRNA sequencing on a NextSeq 2000 SP flow cell (Illumina, CA) using 250 bp 
paired-end reads, and attempted to build a classifier using random forest models 
to assist in the early detection of caries.
RESULTS: The ADONIS test results indicate that there was no significant 
association between sex and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p ~ 0.93), but there was 
a significant association with dental caries status (p ~ 0.001). Using an alpha 
level of 0.05, five differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
were identified between males and females as the main effect along with four 
differentially abundant OTUs between high and low dental caries. The mean 
metrics for the optimal hyperparameter combination using the model with only 
differentially abundant OTUs were: Accuracy (0.701); Matthew's correlation 
coefficient (0.0509); AUC (0.517) and F1 score (0.821) while the mean metrics 
for random forest model using all OTUs were:0.675; 0.054; 0.611 and 0.796 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The assessment of oral microbiota samples in a representative Saudi 
Arabian population for high and low metrics of dental caries yields signatures 
of abundances and diversity.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia constitute a particularly vulnerable 
group for oral diseases. Among the different factors involved, we aimed to 
examine the evidence of how drugs could contribute to the poorer oral health of 
this population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An overview of the potential impact of medication on 
dental/oral health among people with schizophrenia was proposed focusing on 
selected literature.
RESULTS: Studies show a higher dental caries and degree of periodontal diseases 
in this population and point to drug-induced xerostomia as an important risk 
factor for oral health deterioration. The risk of dry mouth depends on not only 
antipsychotics, but also drugs with anticholinergic activity. We hypothesize 
that antipsychotic induced glycaemic alterations might contribute to reduced 
oral health, and that the antimicrobial activity of certain antipsychotics could 
have an impact on oral microbiota affecting oral condition. Pharmacovigilance 
data show that involuntary movements are caused by typical and some atypical 
antipsychotics. Dry mouth is most frequently reported for quetiapine and 
olanzapine, while clozapine is more frequently associated with sialorrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: Literature clearly shows higher caries and periodontal disease in 
schizophrenic patients. However, overall, there is scarce literature about the 
potential influence of drugs in these disorders. Health professionals should be 
aware of this issue in order to implement adequate preventive measures in this 
vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Despite poor oral hygiene, the Baiku Yao (BKY) ethnic group in China 
presents a low prevalence of dental caries, which may be related to genetic 
susceptibility. Due to strict intra-ethnic marriage rule, this ethnic has an 
advantage in studying the interaction between genetic factors and other 
regulatory factors related to dental caries.
METHODS: Peripheral blood from a caries-free adult male was used for whole 
genome sequencing, and the BKY assembled genome was compared to the Han Chinese 
genome. Oral saliva samples were collected from 51 subjects for metabolomic and 
metagenomic analysis. Multiomics data were integrated for combined analysis 
using bioinformatics approaches.
RESULTS: Comparative genomic analysis revealed the presence of structural 
variations in several genes associated with dental caries. Metabolomic and 
metagenomic sequencing demonstrated the caries-free group had significantly 
higher concentration of antimicrobials and higher abundance of core oral 
health-related microbiota. The functional analysis indicated that cationic 
antimicrobial peptide resistance and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway 
were enriched in the caries-free group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided new insights into the specific regulatory 
mechanisms that contribute to the low prevalence of dental caries in the 
specific population and may provide new evidence for the genetic diagnosis and 
control of dental caries.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the microbial functional profile of 
biofilms related to caries-free (CF, n = 6) and caries-arrested (CI, n = 3) 
compared to caries-active (CA, n = 5) individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A metatranscriptomic was performed in supragingival 
biofilm from different clinical conditions related to caries or health. Total 
RNA was extracted and cDNAs were obtained and sequenced (Illumina HiSeq3000). 
Trimmed data (SortMeRNA) were submitted to the SqueezeMeta pipeline in the 
co-assembly mode for functional analysis and further differential gene 
expression analysis (DESeq2) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WCGNA) to explore and identify gene modules related to these clinical 
conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 5303 genes were found in the metatranscriptomic analysis. A 
co-expression network identified the most relevant modules strongly related to 
specific caries status. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the 
eigengene modules and the clinical conditions (CA, CI, and CF) discriminating 
multiple modules. CA and CI showed weak correlation coefficient strength across 
the modules, while the CF condition presented a very strong positive correlation 
coefficient (r = 0.9, p value = 4 × 10-9). Pearson's test was applied to further 
analyze the module membership and gene significance in CF conditions, and the 
most relevant were HSPA1s-K03283, Epr- K13277, and SLC1A-K05613. Gene Ontology 
(GO) shows important bioprocesses, such as two-component system, fructose and 
mannose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and flagellar 
assembly (p-adjust < 0.05). The ability to use different carbohydrates, 
integrate multiple signals, swarm, and bacteriocin production are significant 
metabolic advantages in the oral environment related to CF.
CONCLUSIONS: A distinct functional health profile could be found in CF, where 
co-occurring genes can act in different pathways at the same time. Genes HSPA1s, 
Epr, and SLC1A may be appointed as potential biomarkers for caries-free 
biofilms.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Potential biomarkers for caries-free biofilms could 
contribute to the knowledge of caries prevention and control.

(1) Epidemiological studies have shown that deciduous molar caries are related 
to and more severe than permanent molar caries. This study aimed to investigate 
whether caries subtypes in deciduous molars were associated with caries in first 
permanent molars and to explore taxonomic and functional profiles of the 
microbiota involved in different subtypes. (2) 42 mixed-dentition children were 
recruited and were divided into DMC (carious deciduous molars but caries-free 
first permanent molars; n = 14), C (carious deciduous and first permanent 
molars; n = 13), and control (n = 15) groups. Metagenomic sequencing was 
performed for supragingival plaque samples obtained separately from deciduous 
and first permanent molars. (3) The microbiota of deciduous molars in the DMC 
and C groups differed not only in species-based beta diversity but also in 
compositional and functional profiles. In the C group-like subtype, 14 
caries-related species and potential pathways were identified that could be 
responsible for the caries relationship between the deciduous and permanent 
molars. In the DMC group-like subtype, the overall functional structure, the 
levels of Leptotrichia wadei, Streptococcus anginosus, and Stomatobaculum longum 
and KOs in sugar transporters and fermentation, quorum sensing, and TCA cycle in 
their first permanent molars surprisingly resembled those of the C group rather 
than the control group. This suggested that these clinically sound first 
permanent molars were at a greater risk for caries. (4) Classification of 
deciduous molar caries according to the microbiota could serve as a caries risk 
predictor for adjacent first permanent molars.

Polyphenols, a class of bioactive compounds with phenolic structures, are 
abundant in human diets. They have gained attention in biomedical fields due to 
their beneficial properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, and 
anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, polyphenols can prevent multiple 
chronic or infectious diseases and may help in the prevention of oral diseases. 
Oral health is crucial to our well-being, and maintaining a healthy oral 
microbiome is essential for preventing various dental and systemic diseases. 
However, the mechanisms by which polyphenols modulate the oral microbiota and 
contribute to oral health are still not fully understood, and the application of 
polyphenol products lies in different stages. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of the advancements in understanding polyphenols' effects 
on oral health: dental caries, periodontal diseases, halitosis, and oral cancer. 
The mechanisms underlying the preventive and therapeutic effects of polyphenols 
derived from dietary sources are discussed, and new findings from animal models 
and clinical trials are included, highlighting the latest achievements. Given 
the great application potential of these natural compounds, novel approaches to 
dietary interventions and oral disease treatments may emerge. Moreover, 
investigating polyphenols combined with different materials presents promising 
opportunities for developing innovative therapeutic strategies in the treatment 
of oral diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Common oral diseases are known to be associated with dysbiotic 
shifts in the supragingival microbiome, yet most oral microbiome associations 
with clinical end points emanate from cross-sectional studies. Orthodontic 
treatment is an elective procedure that can be exploited to prospectively 
examine clinically relevant longitudinal changes in the composition and function 
of the supragingival microbiome.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted among 24 adolescent 
orthodontic patients who underwent saliva and plaque sampling and clinical 
examinations at time points: before fixed appliance bonding and at 1, 6, and 12 
wk thereafter. Clinical indices included bleeding on probing (BOP), mean 
gingival index (GI), probing depths (PDs), and plaque index (PI). To study the 
biologically (i.e., transcriptionally) active microbial communities, RNA was 
extracted from plaque and saliva for RNA sequencing and microbiome 
bioinformatics analysis. Longitudinal changes in microbiome beta diversity were 
examined using PERMANOVA tests, and the relative abundance of microbial taxa was 
measured using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and negative 
binomial and zero-inflated mixed models.
RESULTS: Clinical measures of oral health deteriorated over time-the proportion 
of sites with GI and PI ≥1 increased by over 70% between prebonding and 12 wk 
postbonding while the proportion of sites with PD ≥4 mm increased 2.5-fold. 
Streptococcus sanguinis, a health-associated species that antagonizes cariogenic 
pathogens, showed a lasting decrease in relative abundance during orthodontic 
treatment. Contrarily, caries- and periodontal disease-associated taxa, 
including Selenomonas sputigena, Leptotrichia wadei, and Lachnoanaerobaculum 
saburreum, increased in abundance after bonding. Relative abundances of 
Stomatobaculum longum and Mogibacterium diversum in prebonding saliva predicted 
elevated BOP 12 wk postbonding, whereas Neisseria subflava was associated with 
lower BOP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into longitudinal community and 
species-specific changes in the supragingival microbiome transcriptome during 
fixed orthodontic treatment, advancing our understanding of microbial dysbioses 
and identifying targets of future health-promoting clinical investigations.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Bonding braces was associated with subsequent 
changes in the oral microbiome characterized by increases in disease-associated 
species, decreases in health-associated species, and worsened clinical measures 
of oral health.

Globally, caries is among the most frequent chronic childhood disease, and the 
fungal component of the microbial community responsible is poorly studied 
despite evidence that fungi contribute to increased acid production exacerbating 
enamel demineralization. HIV infection is another global health crisis. 
Perinatal HIV exposure with infection are caries risk factors; however, the 
caries experience in the context of perinatal HIV exposure without infection is 
less clear. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we find taxonomic 
differences that become pronounced during late-stage caries. Notably, we show a 
stronger correlation with health-associated taxa for HIV-exposed-but-uninfected 
children when compared to unexposed and uninfected children. This aligns with a 
lower incidence of caries in primary teeth at age 6 or less for exposed yet 
uninfected children. Ultimately, these findings could contribute to improved 
risk assessment, intervention, and prevention strategies such as biofilm 
disruption and the informed design of pro-, pre-, and synbiotic oral therapies.

This is the concluding article in the supplement on the role of mouthwashes in 
oral care, which summarises the current guidelines across the globe regarding 
their acceptable adjunctive use for managing caries, gingivitis, and periodontal 
disease. Based on moderate evidence for clinical effectiveness, most current 
guidelines suggest fluoride mouthwashes for the management of dental caries, and 
chlorhexidine for the management of periodontal diseases. However there still 
appears to be gaps in the literature underpinning these recommendations. 
Importantly, all evidence supports such mouthwash use "adjunctively," alongside 
mechanical oral hygiene measures. Other antimicrobial mouthwashes such as 
essential oils and cetylpyridinium chloride may also be clinically effective 
against plaque and gingivitis, but there is a current lack of robust evidence of 
natural mouthwashes to recommend their adjunctive use. The authors of the 
current review are of the view that mouthwashes may not be of much value in 
those with good periodontal health or low caries risk. The reasons for this are, 
the potential i) risks of allergic reactions, ii) dysbiosis of the oral 
microbiota, iii) emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and iv) deleterious 
effects on the environment. There is, however, much empirical research needed on 
mouthwashes, particularly in vivo research derived through clinical trials. 
Thus, dental practitioners need to keep abreast of the evidence base on the 
current, and the emerging, over-the-counter mouthwashes, and pay heed to the 
consensus views emanating from systematic reviews, as well as international 
guidelines on mouthwashes.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to review halitosis research, discuss its various 
causes, and propose effective interventions based on the underlying etiologies 
and mechanisms. The main research question is to identify the primary factors 
contributing to halitosis and appropriate strategies to address them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted on 
halitosis and its associated causes, including oral pathological factors, oral 
microbial influences, microbial metabolic pathways, gastrointestinal diseases, 
and gut microbiota dysbiosis.
RESULTS: Unhealthy eating habits and an imbalance of microorganisms in the oral 
cavity and gastrointestinal tract were identified as primary causes of 
halitosis. Dental caries, periodontal disease, xerostomia, and digestive 
disorders like gastritis and irritable bowel syndrome were also found to be 
related to the development of halitosis. Due to poor oral hygiene or antibiotic 
use, disruption of microbial communities can result in dysbiosis, inflammation, 
and halitosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Halitosis is a multifactorial condition with various underlying 
causes, including oral and systemic diseases. Effective interventions should be 
tailored based on the specific etiologies and mechanisms involved.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the factors contributing to halitosis is 
crucial for developing appropriate treatment strategies. Enhancing oral hygiene 
habits, using antimicrobial drugs, or administering probiotics may help regulate 
oral or intestinal flora, thereby improving halitosis and overall oral health.

Understanding the development of oral microbiota early in life and the factors 
that influence it is important for preventing the establishment of dysbiotic 
oral microbiota later in life. This study demonstrates that the tongue 
microbiota undergoes early development from 4 to 18 months of age and converges 
into two types of microbiota showing indications of adult characteristics, with 
either S. salivarius or Neisseria-dominance. Interestingly, their divergence was 
strongly determined by their weaning status and the dietary frequencies of 
sweetened beverages, snacks, and fruits, suggesting that dietary habits during 
this period might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota. These 
findings may contribute to the development of novel preventive strategies 
against oral microbiota-related diseases.

Oral health plays a significant role in the quality of life and overall 
well-being of the aging population. However, age-related changes in oral health 
are not well understood due to challenges with current animal models. In this 
study, we analyzed the oral health and microbiota of a short-lived non-human 
primate (i.e., marmoset), as a step towards establishing a surrogate for 
studying the changes that occur in oral health during human aging. We 
investigated the oral health of marmosets using cadaveric tissues in three 
different cohorts: young (aged ≤6 years), middle-aged, and older (>10 years) and 
assessed the gingival bacterial community using analyses of the V3-V4 variable 
region of 16S rRNA gene. The oldest cohort had a significantly higher number of 
dental caries, increased dental attrition/erosion, and deeper periodontal pocket 
depth scores. Oral microbiome analyses showed that older marmosets had a 
significantly greater abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Propionibacterium, 
and a lower abundance of Agrobacterium/Rhizobium at the genus level. Alpha 
diversity of the microbiome between the three groups showed no significant 
differences; however, principal coordinate analysis and non-metric 
multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples from middle-aged and 
older marmosets were more closely clustered than the youngest cohort. In 
addition, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEFSe) identified a higher 
abundance of Esherichia-Shigella as a potential pathogenic biomarker in older 
animals. Our findings confirm that changes in the oral microbiome are associated 
with a decline in oral health in aging marmosets. The current study suggests 
that the marmoset model recapitulates some of the changes in oral health 
associated with human aging and may provide opportunities for developing new 
preventive strategies or interventions which target these disease conditions.

Aim: Probiotic microorganisms, commonly used to bolster gut health, might also 
have benefits for dental health, according to certain studies. Probiotics (PBs) 
are associated with reducing cariogenic pathogens and protecting against 
periodontal diseases, although the exact way they function in the mouth is not 
fully clear. Our study aimed to explore the use of PBs to improve oral health, 
focusing on issues such as cavities, gum disease, bad breath, mucositis, and 
periimplantitis. Materials and Methods: We utilized the Boolean keywords 
"Probiotics" AND "Oral health" to search the databases of PubMed, Scopus, and 
Web of Science. The search was restricted to English-language papers published 
from 1 January 2019 to 13 April 2023. Results: A total of 3460 articles were 
found through our computerized search. After removing duplicates, reviewing the 
papers, and determining their relevance, 12 were selected for inclusion. 
Conclusions: Assessing how bacteria in food or dietary supplements might alter 
the stable oral microbiota is a complex task. Although probiotic microorganisms 
have been found to have proven therapeutic benefits, their application in dental 
health is not yet solidly backed by evidence. Further research is necessary to 
thoroughly understand the long-term effects of probiotic bacteria on the oral 
environment, including their ability to colonize and form biofilms.

Human colostrum (HC) is essential for oral health as it is rich in probiotics 
that could affect the growth of the cariogenic S. mutans and its biofilm 
formation; hindering dental caries in advance. In this study, HC was collected 
from 36 healthy mothers 1-3 days postpartum. The effect of HC on oral health was 
carried out by assessing the impact of HC and its derived probiotics' cell-free 
supernatants (CFS) on the growth of S. mutans (using modified well diffusion) 
and its biofilm formation (using microtiter plate assay). Moreover, the effect 
of whole HC on L. rhamnosus, a probiotic oral bacterium, was examined. 
Probiotics were isolated and identified phenotypically by API 50 CH carbohydrate 
fermentation and genotypically by 16S rRNA amplification. The in vitro study 
revealed that HC has cariogenic activity and is associated with biofilm 
formation. Biofilm strength was inversely proportional to HC dilution (p-value < 
0.0001). Nevertheless, HC and colostrum-derived probiotics improve oral health 
by inhibiting the growth of caries-inducing S. mutans with lower inhibition to 
L. rhamnosus probiotics. The CFS of isolated probiotics reduced the biofilm 
formation via the cariogenic S. mutans. These results are not only promising for 
caries eradication, but they also highlight the importance of breastfeeding 
infants from their first hours to shape healthy oral microbiota, protecting them 
from various diseases including dental caries.

BACKGROUND: Cleft in the lip and/or palate (CLP) is a congenital facial 
deformity that significantly impacts the oral cavity's structure and function. 
This malformation can affect the oral microbiota. The objective of this 
systematic review was to examine and consolidate the current scientific evidence 
on the oral microflora in children with CLP.
METHODS: The search strategy included the PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of 
Science, Scopus, and Embase databases. The inclusion criteria were studies 
assessing oral microbiota in children with CLP. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) 
was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 422 potential articles. Twelve papers 
met the inclusion criteria. High heterogeneity was observed in methodologies, 
sample sites, and patient characteristics. Eight studies assessed the levels of 
Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in saliva, with some reporting 
significantly higher levels in the cleft group compared to controls, while 
others found no differences. One study reported a significantly higher 
colonization rate of Candida species in patients with cleft lip and/or palate.
CONCLUSION: The results of the available studies are unclear. Further research 
is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the oral microbiota and 
potential implications for oral health management in this population. The review 
was not registered Registration Statement.

OBJECTIVE: Oral candidiasis is a common fungal infection that affects the oral 
mucosa, and happens when Candida albicans interacts with bacteria in the oral 
microbiota, such as Streptococcus mutans, causing severe early childhood caries. 
C. albicans and S. mutans mixed biofilms are challenging to treat with 
conventional antimicrobial therapies, thus, new anti-infective drugs are 
required. This study aimed to test a drug delivery system based on chitosan 
microparticles loaded with geranium and lemongrass essential oils to inhibit C. 
albicans and S. mutans mixed biofilms.
METHODOLOGY: Chitosan microparticles loaded with essential oils (CM-EOs) were 
obtained by spray-drying. Susceptibility of planktonic were performed according 
CLSI at 4 to 2,048 µg/mL. Mixed biofilms were incubated at 37ºC for 48 h and 
exposed to CM-EOs at 256 to 4,096 µg/mL. The antimicrobial effect was evaluated 
using the MTT assay, with biofilm architectural changes analyzed by scanning 
electron microscopy. RAW 264.7 cell was used to evaluate compound cytotoxicity.
RESULTS: CM-EOs had better planktonic activity against C. albicans than S. 
mutans. All samples reduced the metabolic activity of mixed C. albicans and S. 
mutans biofilms, with encapsulated oils showing better activity than raw 
chitosan or oils. The microparticles reduced the biofilm on the slides. The 
essential oils showed cytotoxic effects against RAW 264.7 cells, but 
encapsulation into chitosan microparticles decreased their toxicity.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that chitosan loaded with essential oils may 
provide an alternative method for treating diseases caused by C. albicans and S. 
mutans mixed biofilm, such as dental caries.
