Commensal Neisseria Inhibit Porphyromonas Gingivalis Invasion of Gingival 
Epithelial Cells.

Fukuda S, Akatsu T, Fujii A, Kawano S, Minegishi Y, Ota N.

PURPOSE: Periodontal disease is caused by periodontal invasion by pathogens such 
as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Although recent metagenomic analyses have shown 
that oral commensal bacteria are abundant in the mouth of healthy individuals, 
few studies have experimentally verified the benefits and functions of oral 
commensal bacteria in periodontal diseases. In this study, we focused on 
Neisseria among the oral commensal bacteria and aimed to experimentally verify 
its effects on P. gingivalis invasion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the inhibitory effect of Neisseria spp. on 
P. gingivalis invasion using a flow cytometry-based invasion assay and analysed 
bacterial interactions by visualisation using scanning electron microscopy. 
Furthermore, we constructed a new experimental pre-mixed culture system that 
reproduced the interaction environment to evaluate the relevance of this 
interaction in invasion inhibition.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry-based invasion assays showed that all Neisseria spp. 
inhibited P. gingivalis invasion, with Neisseria mucosa and Neisseria elongata 
being particularly effective. Interaction analysis using scanning electron 
microscopy showed that N. mucosa and N. elongata, which have strong inhibitory 
effects on P. gingivalis invasion, interacted with P. gingivalis at high 
frequencies.
CONCLUSION: Commensal Neisseria was found to exert a beneficial function by 
directly interacting with P. gingivalis and inhibiting its invasion of gingival 
epithelial cells. These results suggest that Neisseria, as a probiotic or 
synbiotic oral commensal, may represent an innovative approach to preventing 
periodontal disease.

Vibrio diabolicus is widely distributed in the marine environment and is an 
important pathogen of aquatic organisms such as shrimp, fish, and mollusks. The 
emergence of multi-drug resistance among these bacteria has resulted in a global 
public health problem, which requires alternative treatment approaches, such as 
phage therapy. In the present study, we isolated the phage vB_Vc_SrVc2 from the 
hepatopancreas of white shrimp showing symptoms of acute hepatopancreatic 
necrosis disease (AHPND) and evaluated the efficacy of this phage in preventing 
the mortality associated with V. diabolicus presence in shrimp culture. Phage 
vB_Vc_SrVc2 belongs to the genus Maculvirus within the family Autographiviridae 
and demonstrates high lytic ability against Vibrio isolates. It exhibits 
substantial resilience across a broad range of temperatures, salinity levels, UV 
radiation and chloroform exposure. The phage genome size is 43,157 bp, with a GC 
content of 49.2%, that encodes 49 putative ORFs, and no tRNAs. Compared to phage 
vB_Vc_SrVc9, it shows three single nucleotide polymorphisms, two small 
deletions, and one nucleotide insertion, which result in slightly different 
infectivity profiles. No lysogeny-related genes were detected in the vB_Vc_SrVc2 
genome. In vivo trials revealed that the phage offered protection against V. 
diabolicus infection by delaying mortality onset by at least 40 h post-infection 
(hpi). Although phage vB_Vc_SrVc2 alone significantly reduced mortality 
associated with V. diabolicus infection, this capacity could be enhanced with 
multiple doses and/or the use of phage cocktails or probiotics. Overall, phage 
vB_Vc_SrVc2 shows promising potential for therapeutic application in the 
aquaculture industry against V. diabolicus infections.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide and has become a global 
emergent disease. Probiotics have been reported to be effective in relieving 
colitis. Previous studies found ripened Pu-erh tea (RPT) promoted gut microbiota 
resilience against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice by 
increasing relative abundance of Lactobacillus. However, whether and how it 
alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice need to be explored. Here, we screened a 
probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii GLJ001 from feces of ripened Pu-erh tea 
(RPT)-administrated mice. In this study, L. johnsonii GLJ001 attenuated symptoms 
of DSS-induced colitis in mice, including weight loss, increased disease 
activity index (DAI), colon shortening and colon tissue damage, as well as high 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and disturbances of intestine barrier 
function. Furthermore, abundances of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing 
bacteria (i.e. Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa, Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis 
and Ruminococcus) were enhanced in the cecum of mice treated with L. johnsonii 
GLJ001, accompanying by an increase of SCFAs. It was also found that SCFAs 
inhibited mRNA expression of M1 macrophage markers (Inos and CD86), inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α and Il-1β) and SCFAs receptors (Gpr41 and Gpr43) induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in THP-1 cell line. 
Collectively, L. johnsonii GLJ001 prevented DSS-induced colitis in mice by 
inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization via gut microbiota-SCFAs axis, and can be 
administered for management of colitis.

Excessive cholesterol levels can lead to hypercholesterolemia, which is related 
to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and CVDs are a serious threat to human 
health. Therefore, lowering cholesterol levels is necessary, and diet 
intervention is safer than drugs are. The cholesterol-lowering effect of 
Levilactobacillus brevis M-10 isolated from spontaneously fermented millet sour 
porridge was investigated in fifty C57BL/6N male mice. After a 4-week 
intervention, the food intake, weight gains and organ indices were calculated; 
the lipid contents in the serum, liver, and feces were determined; the 
histopathology of the liver tissues was observed; the expression of 
metabolism-related genes was determined; and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) 
levels in the droppings were monitored. The results showed that administration 
of a high dose of L. brevis M-10 (1 × 1010 CFU/mL) significantly reduced food 
intake, suppressed weight gain; prevented excessive liver growth; and reduced 
the total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins; and total 
hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents (P < 0.05) in high-cholesterol 
mice. Moreover, a high dose of L. brevis M-10 significantly promoted the fecal 
excretion of cholesterol and triglycerides (P < 0.05) and alleviated liver 
damage induced by a high-cholesterol diet. Furthermore, a high dose of L. brevis 
M-10 significantly downregulated the cholesterol metabolism-related gene 
expression of NPC1L1, ACAT2, HMG-CoA, and SREBP2 but upregulated the gene 
expression of ABCG5, CYP7A1, and LXR-α (P < 0.05). Additionally, a high dose of 
L. brevis M-10 significantly increased SCFA contents, including those of acetic 
acid, propionic acid and n-butyric acid (P < 0.05). These findings could provide 
support for the use of L. brevis M-10 in the application of functional foods to 
alleviate hypercholesterolemia.

Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for infants. Human milk 
oligosaccharides (HMOs) and the corresponding HMOs-consuming Bifidobacterium 
positively influence infant health. This study aims to isolate and characterize 
Bifidobacterium from breast milk of healthy Chinese mothers, identifying the 
most efficacious strains for inclusion in simulated maternal milk formulas. Nine 
Bifidobacterium strains (two of B. breve and seven of B. infantis) were 
isolated, exhibiting a broad spectrum of probiotic potential. This included 
tolerance to simulated infant gastrointestinal conditions, notable adhesion, 
antibacterial, antioxidant activities, and HMOs utilization ability. 
Lacto-N-Tetraose (LNT) is preferred in early growth among Bifidobacterium 
isolates. B. breve showed a preference for LNT, whereas B. infantis showed a 
preference for fucosylated HMOs, and displayed reduced utilization of sialylated 
HMOs. They also exhibited robust safety profiles, including no hemolytic 
activity, an appropriate D/L lactate-producing ratio, and non-toxicity in an 
acute oral toxicity assay on mice. It is noteworthy that B. breve N-90, O-147, 
B. infantis O-161 and R-1 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced RAW 
264.7 cells. Specifically, a notable reduction in TNF-α levels was observed in 
pre-treatment, while a decrease in IL-1β and IL-6 levels in co-treatment. B. 
breve N-90 and B. infantis R-1 were identified finally as promising probiotic 
candidates. Their whole-genome sequencing analysis confirmed presence of 
functional genes associated with gastrointestinal colonization, antioxidation, 
and glycoside hydrolase activity on HMOs. The annotation for antibiotic 
resistance and virulence genes concurred with phenotypes, further validating the 
safety. Breast milk is a good source for Bifidobacteria isolation, while 
Bifidobacteria utilize HMOs in a strain-dependent manner. The two selected 
strains, B. breve N-90 and B. infantis R-1, are potential candidates for 
inclusion in simulated maternal milk formulas and deserved further in vivo 
investigation for their health-promoting effects.

Probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested as natural agents against viral 
infections and dysbiosis and may encourage clinical applications. This review 
aims to analyze the main and recent advances related to viral infections such as 
Covid-19 and its gastrointestinal complications, antiviral immunity generated 
and possible preventive role that probiotics and/or prebiotics can play in 
controlling and promoting antiviral immunity. The literature search was 
performed through a critical analysis of relevant publications reported in 
PubMed and Scopus databases on clinical trials and assays conducted in vitro on 
colon cells and in vivo on mice. Some studies using probiotics and prebiotics 
for the prevention of viral infection in different age groups are discussed. 
Covid-19 patients have been shown to suffer from gastrointestinal complications 
in addition to respiratory symptoms due to interactions between the respiratory 
system and the gastrointestinal tract infected with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, 
therapies used to prevent (or treat) symptoms of Covid-19 have proven to be of 
limited effectiveness. In addition, the lack of access to coronavirus vaccines 
around the world and vaccine hesitancy continue to hamper control of Covid-19. 
It is therefore crucial to find alternative methods that can prevent disease 
symptoms. Evidence-based efficacy of certain probiotics (Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium) that may be useful in viral infections was shown with 
immunomodulatory properties (pro-inflammatory mediators reduction), promoting 
antiviral immunity (antibodies production, virus titers) and controlling 
inflammation (anti-inflammatory effect), as well as viral clearance and 
antimicrobial potential against opportunistic bacteria (anti-dysbiosis effect). 
But, available data about clinical application of probiotics in Covid-19 context 
remain limited and relevant scientific investigation is still in its early 
stages. Also, evidence for prebiotics potential in this field is limited, since 
the exact mechanism involved in systemic immune modulation by these compounds is 
till now unknown. Thus, further research is necessary to explore in the viral 
infection context the mechanism by which gut and lung interact in the presence 
of probiotics and prebiotics through more animal and clinical experiments.

Negative experiences during adolescence, such as social isolation (SI), 
bullying, and abuse, increase the risk of psychiatric diseases in adulthood. 
However, the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases induced by these factors 
remain poorly understood. In adolescents, stress affects the intestinal 
homeostasis in the gut-brain axis. This study determined whether adolescent SI 
induces behavioral abnormalities by disrupting colonic function. Adolescent mice 
exposed to SI exhibit spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in 
the hippocampus (HIP). SI decreased the differentiation of mucin-producing 
goblet cells, which was accompanied by alterations in the composition of the gut 
microbiota, particularly the depletion of mucin-feeding bacteria. Treatment with 
rebamipide, which promotes goblet cell differentiation in the colon, attenuated 
SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and microglial activation in the HIP and 
decreased cystine, a downstream metabolite of homocysteine. Treatment with 
cystine ameliorated SI-induced spatial cognitive deficits and increased 
microglial C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) levels in the HIP. Inhibition of 
CCL7 receptors by antagonists of CC motif chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 3 
(CCR3) in the HIP prevented spatial cognitive deficits induced by SI. Infusion 
of CCL7 into the HIP following microglial ablation with clodronate liposome 
induced spatial cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that adolescent SI 
decreases serum cystine levels by damaging the colonic goblet cells, resulting 
in spatial cognitive deficits by triggering microglial activation in the HIP. 
Our results indicate that increased CCL7 expression in hippocampal microglia may 
contribute to spatial cognitive deficits by activating CCR2 and CCR3.

Early weaning is frequently accompanied by a significant increase in diarrhea 
and mortality rates, which reduces rabbits' performance. Although antibiotics 
can reduce pathogenic bacteria, they also harm beneficial microorganisms and 
disrupt the normal intestinal microbiota balance. In order to find non-residue 
and non-toxic alternatives to antibiotics to ensure the safety of animal 
products, we conducted a study on the effect of compound microecological 
preparations supplementation on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. A 
total of 60 female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups: CON, 
supplemented with probiotics at 3, 6, and 9 g/female rabbit/day from day 24 of 
gestation until weaning. We observed that probiotics supplementation 
significantly enhanced production performance (P < 0.05), immune and antioxidant 
function (P < 0.05), as well as intestinal flora composition in lactating 
rabbits and their offspring. Notably, compared with the control group, the 
experimental group exhibited a 19.23%, 44.22%, and 24.57% increase in milk yield 
(P = 0.002). Regarding rabbit growth performance, the average body weight of 
young rabbits in the experimental group showed a significant increase of 3.59%, 
10.22%, and 6.74% at day 35 (P = 0.022), whereas the average daily gain (ADG) of 
rabbits aged between 21 and 35 days was significantly elevated by 4.94%, 17.06%, 
and 6.28% in the experimental group (P < 0.001). In conclusion, probiotics 
supplementation can significantly enhance lactation performance, promote growth 
and disease resistance in rabbits, as well as improve intestinal health when 
administered at a dosage of 6 g/day. Moreover, the limited sample size in this 
study may hinder the detection of subtle effects, and augmenting the sample size 
will bolster the reliability of the study findings.
IMPORTANCE: The intestinal environment of rabbits is fragile and susceptible to 
environmental influences, leading to inflammatory intestinal diseases. Adding 
antibiotics to rabbit feed can achieve the effect of preventing and treating 
inflammation, which can also lead to the imbalance of the gut microbiota and 
residual antibiotics in agricultural products. Composite probiotics are live 
microbial feed additives composed of various ratios of probiotics and have 
become the most promising alternative to antibiotics due to their residue-free 
and non-toxic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 
compound probiotics on lactating female rabbits and their offspring. Our 
findings highlight the potential of compound microecological preparations as an 
effective strategy for enhancing lactation performance, immune function, and 
antioxidant capacity in rabbits. The supplementation of probiotics through 
rabbit milk offers a promising approach to optimize the growth and health 
outcomes of newborn rabbits.

Fermented fruits and vegetables are rich in phenolic compounds, minerals, and 
vitamins, which have potential health benefits for the prevention of many 
diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. There is a growing 
demand for the development of nondairy probiotic products based on fruits and 
vegetables in view of changing lifestyles (e.g., vegetarianism, veganism, and 
allergy to dairy products) and the rise of nutritional diet therapy. In this 
review, the processes and health potential of fermented fruits and vegetables 
are described. The study focuses on the role of bacteria and fungi in fermented 
fruits and vegetables, outlines the process of transformation of bioactive 
components, and systematically summarizes the possible mechanisms of 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and blood pressure-lowering effects. The health 
effects of fermented fruits and vegetables depend mainly on the microorganisms 
present in the fermentation process and the bioactive components they produce, 
such as phenols, vitamins, and organic acids. These active compounds exert many 
health effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, 
hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and other health benefits. Therefore, the development 
of fermented foods based on fruits and vegetables can be a promising way to 
adapt to the market demand and to reduce the wastage of agriculturally produced 
fruits and vegetables.

BACKGROUND: Heat stress significantly impacts dairy cows, primarily through 
oxidative stress, which undermines their health. The problem is exacerbated by 
the ongoing global warming trend. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are safe, 
economical, and readily accessible options for enhancing the host's antioxidant 
defenses and preventing oxidative damage. They have been proven effective in 
alleviating heat stress-related damage, making them an excellent choice for 
protecting dairy cows from the adverse effects of heat stress.
METHOD: In this study, five strains of LAB from Holstein cow milk (Lactobacillus 
plantarum L5, L14, L17, L19, L20) were evaluated for their heat resistance and 
antioxidant capacity by evaluating the growth characteristics and tolerance of 
the strains under high-temperature conditions, as well as their H2O2 tolerance, 
free radical scavenging ability (DPPH, OH-, ABTS), reducing ability, and EPS 
production ability. Furthermore, we employed Caco-2 cells to assess the adhesion 
rate of the strain, thereby confirming its ability to successfully colonize the 
host's intestinal tract and ensuring the effective execution of its probiotic 
functions. The strain with excellent heat resistance and antioxidant capacity 
was then subjected to genomic analysis to gain insight into the molecular 
mechanisms behind their heat resistance, antioxidant capacity, and safety.
RESULTS: Among the two strains, Lactobacillus plantarum L19 emerges as a highly 
promising candidate. The strain exhibits robust growth even at high temperatures 
at 40°C and maintains a survival rate of 16.42% at the extreme temperature of 
65°C. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior tolerance to hydrogen peroxide 
(27.3%), and possesses a notably higher free radical scavenging capacity with a 
high adhesion rate to Caco-2 cell (22.19%) compared to the other four strains 
tested. Genomic analysis revealed its' genome has 17 genes related to 
antioxidants and three genes related to heat resistance. Importantly, L19 lacks 
any resistance genes, ensuring its safety as a probiotic.
CONCLUSION: The results imply that Lactobacillus plantarum L19 has the potential 
to serve as an effective food additive in mitigating damages associated with 
heat stress. This research offers a valuable reference for the prevention and 
management of heat stress in dairy cows, while also expanding the scope of 
applications for LAB derived from cow milk.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, 
confer a health benefit to the host. The selection criteria for probiotics 
include strain safety, viability, tolerance, metabolite production and/or the 
ability to modulate the immune system. Probiotics are commonly used in 
industries, such as food, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, 
and aquaculture. Recently, the medicinal applications of probiotics have gained 
attention and are being explored for the prevention and treatment of various 
diseases. One emerging area of interest is their potential role in psychological 
disorders. Mental illnesses, characterised by disturbances in behaviour, mood, 
thinking, and emotions, affect over one billion people globally. While various 
preventive and treatment options for mental disorders exists, each is associated 
with certain limitations. A new avenue being explored is the gut-brain axis, a 
complex bi-directional communication between the gut and the brain, that is 
facilitated by hormonal, neuronal, humoral, and immunological pathways. This 
system plays an important role in mental health. Probiotics, as a key modulator 
of the gut microbiome, could play a vital role in this communication. However, 
the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Probiotics may act through the 
production of metabolites and neuroactive substances, as well as through 
immunomodulation and cytokine production. Current data shows promising effects 
on stress, mood, and depression, presenting probiotics as a potential natural 
treatment option for psychological disorders. Nevertheless, major limitations in 
the existing research include insufficient clinical outcomes, limited sample 
sizes, and variable dosing. Future advancements may be achieved through 
stratifications based on gut microbiota, the use of next-generation probiotic 
strains, and the conduct of comprehensive validation studies.

The efficacy of immunotherapy in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
has been restricted due to its low immunogenicity and suppressive immune 
microenvironment. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have emerged as 
innovative immunotherapeutic agents in antitumor therapy by stimulating the 
innate immune system, but intricate modifications and undesirable multiple dose 
administration severely hinder their utility. Herein, a two-step bacterial 
metabolic labeling technique was utilized for the bioorthogonal engineering of 
OMVs. At first, d-propargylglycine (DPG, an alkyne-containing d-amino acid) was 
introduced into the incubation process of probiotic Escherichia coli 1917 (Ecn) 
to produce DPG-functionalized OMVs, which were subsequently conjugated with 
azide-functionalized new indocyanine green (IR820) to yield OMV-DPG-IR820. The 
combination of phototherapy and immunostimulation of OMV-DPG-IR820 effectively 
arouses adaptive immune responses, causing maturation of dendritic cells, 
infiltration of T cells, repolarization of the M2 macrophage to the M1 
macrophage, and upregulation of inflammatory factors. Remarkably, OMV-DPG-IR820 
demonstrated tumor-targeting capabilities with guidance provided by 
near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging, leading to remarkable inhibition 
on both primary and distant tumors and preventing metastasis without causing 
noticeable adverse reactions. This study elucidates a sophisticated 
bioorthogonal engineering strategy for the design and production of 
functionalized OMVs and provides novel perspectives on the microbiome-mediated 
reversal of TNBC through a precise and efficient immunotherapy.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a malignancy with a high incidence and poor prognosis, 
significantly influenced by dysbiosis in the esophageal, oral, and gut 
microbiota. This review provides an overview of the roles of microbiota 
dysbiosis in EC pathogenesis, emphasizing their impact on tumor progression, 
drug efficacy, biomarker discovery, and therapeutic interventions. Lifestyle 
factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel nut use are major 
contributors to dysbiosis and EC development. Recent studies utilizing advanced 
sequencing have revealed complex interactions between microbiota dysbiosis and 
EC, with oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium 
nucleatum promoting inflammation and suppressing immune responses, thereby 
driving carcinogenesis. Altered esophageal microbiota, characterized by reduced 
beneficial bacteria and increased pathogenic species, further exacerbate local 
inflammation and tumor growth. Gut microbiota dysbiosis also affects systemic 
immunity, influencing chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, with certain 
bacteria enhancing or inhibiting treatment responses. Microbiota composition 
shows potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection, prognosis, and 
personalized therapy. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiota-such 
as probiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation-offer 
promising avenues to restore balance and improve treatment efficacy, potentially 
enhancing patient outcomes. Integrating microbiome-focused strategies into 
current therapeutic frameworks could improve EC management, reduce adverse 
effects, and enhance patient survival. These findings highlight the need for 
further research into microbiota-tumor interactions and microbial interventions 
to transform EC treatment and prevention, particularly in cases of late-stage 
diagnosis and poor treatment response.

INTRODUCTION: Rare earth elements (REEs) are widely used in plenty of fields. 
REEs have significant neurotoxicity and it may adversely affect the development 
of cognitive. For example, neodymium will causing neurological damage through 
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, whether it disrupts the 
balance of brain-gut axis (BGA) crosstalk and affects the intestinal 
microecology disorder of host is still unclear. This study investigated the 
neural damage on children caused by maternal exposure to Neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) 
during pregnancy, and its involved mechanism of BGA injury.
METHODS: We used rat model to investigated the mechanisms of the offspring's 
neural damage that Nd2O3 exposure in pregnancy. To verify the neural damage of 
offspring rats, we examed BBB-related factors, such like glutamate and ROS 
levels in brain tissue, behavioral tests, hippocampal and cortical damage, as 
well as changes in gut microbiota, intestinal mucosal barrier, and SCFAs in the 
intestine. Also, we observed some specific indicators of intestinal immune 
barrier function and gut nerve-related indicators.
RESULTS: Maternal Nd2O3 exposure reduced the content of offspring tight junction 
proteins, increased BBB permeability, leading to Nd accumulation and brain 
tissue inflammation, affecting offspring's neural development and weakening 
their spatial learning ability. Nd2O3 also disrupted BBB integrity by regulating 
SCFAs and BGA. Probiotic intervention in the offspring rats exposed to 2% Nd2O3 
showed significant recovery of inflammation in both brain and colon tissues, and 
reduced BBB permeability.
CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to Nd2O3 affects the offspring's BGA, targeting 
brain and colon tissues, increasing BBB permeability, affecting neural 
development, causing damage to the intestinal mucosa, and impacting children's 
gut development. Probiotics can alleviate these effects. These findings provide 
valuable insights into understanding the neurodevelopmental and intestinal 
developmental toxicity of Nd2O3 and its prevention and treatment. It also calls 
for a comprehensive assessment of the health risks of susceptible populations to 
Nd2O3, such as pregnant women. It may providing theoretical basis for preventing 
and controlling neodymium-induced harm in children by examing the repair 
mechanism of the damage through probiotic intervention.

The growing risk of contracting viral infections due to high-density populations 
and ecological disruptions, such as climate change and increased population 
mobility, has highlighted the necessity for effective antiviral treatment and 
preventive measures against Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and 
Zika virus (ZIKV). Recently, there has been increasing attention on the use of 
probiotics as a potential antiviral option to reduce virus infections. The 
present study aimed to assess the immunomodulatory effects of heat-killed 
Lactococcus lactis strain plasma (LC-Plasma) on peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) and its subsequent antiviral response against DENV, CHIKV, and 
ZIKV. To evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of LC-Plasma on PBMCs isolated 
from healthy individuals, PBMCs were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well 
and stimulated with 10 µg/mL of LC-Plasma. LC-plasma-stimulated PBMCs 
demonstrated elevated interferon-alpha (IFN-α) production and cluster of 
differentiation 86 (CD86) and human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR) 
upregulation, potentially linked to plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) 
activation. The replication of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV was dose-dependently 
inhibited when Huh-7 cells were stimulated with LC-Plasma-stimulated PBMC 
supernatant (LCP Sup). IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, including 
IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), IFN-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), 
IFN-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM-1), myxovirus resistance protein A 
(MxA), and radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing protein 2 (RSAD2), 
was significantly upregulated in LCP Sup-stimulated Huh-7 cells. Findings from 
this study indicate that LC-Plasma has the potential to induce IFN-α production, 
leading to an enhancement in the expression of ISGs and contributing to a 
broad-spectrum antiviral response. Thus, LC-Plasma may serve as a rational 
adjunctive treatment to ameliorate viral diseases, warranting future clinical 
trials.

Currently, there is increasing interest in the commercial utilization of 
probiotics isolated from traditional fermented food products. Therefore, this 
study aimed to investigate the probiotic potential of Lactiplantibacillus 
plantarum (L. plantarum) Z22 isolated from naturally fermented mustard. The 
results suggest that L. plantarum Z22 exhibits good adhesion ability, 
antibacterial activity, safety, and tolerance to acidic conditions and bile 
salts. We further determined the anti-inflammatory mechanism and properties of 
L. plantarum Z22 and found that L. plantarum Z22 could significantly reduce the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the expression of 
the pro-inflammatory mediator cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein in LPS-induced 
RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, L. plantarum Z22 also effectively inhibited the 
signaling pathways of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPKs). This effect can be attributed to a decrease in the levels of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. 
Moreover, whole-genome sequencing revealed that L. plantarum Z22 contains 
gene-encoding proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as 
beta-glucosidase (BGL) and pyruvate kinase (PK), as well as antioxidant 
functions, including thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), tyrosine-protein phosphatase, 
and ATP-dependent intracellular proteases ClpP. In summary, these results 
indicated that L. plantarum Z22 can serve as a potential candidate probiotic for 
use in fermented foods such as yogurt (starter cultures), providing a promising 
strategy for the development of functional foods to prevent chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Developing interventions for Johne's disease, which 
focuses on controlling Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in 
contaminated environments by treating infected cows and preventing transmission 
from diseased animals, is a critical priority. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy, an 
emerging biological intervention, offers a promising alternative for the 
treatment and management of MAP infections.
METHODS: In this study, we generated an MAP-specific lytic phage library aimed 
at characterizing the therapeutic potential of phages under environmental and 
biological conditions that mimic those encountered in infected cattle such as 
ruminal fluid, milk, colostrum, and the bovine intestinal epithelium, a key site 
of MAP colonization and, later, transmission.
RESULTS: Our library contains a diverse collection of phages that have 
demonstrated robust lytic activity against MAP. The host range of these phages 
was thoroughly assessed, revealing that several isolates produce clear plaques 
on a range of MAP strains, as well as other pathogenic non-tuberculous 
mycobacterial (NTM) species and M. tuberculosis strains. This broad host range 
expands the therapeutic potential of the phage collection, positioning it as a 
potential cross-species antimicrobial tool. In vitro tests under conditions 
replicating the rumen, milk, and colostrum environments show that selected 
phages maintain stability and lytic efficacy, even in the presence of complex 
biological fluids. Furthermore, a subset of these phages was capable of 
preventing MAP colonization and invasion in cultured bovine epithelial cells, 
suggesting their potential for direct prophylactic application in cattle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our collection of MAP phages represents a valuable source that can 
be developed into probiotic-like preparations, offering a cost-effective 
solution for prophylaxis and control of Johne's disease.

Antwerp, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a species found in a wide range of 
ecological niches, including vegetables and dairy products, and it may occur 
naturally in the human gastrointestinal tract. The precise mechanisms underlying 
the beneficial properties of these microbes to their host remain obscure. 
Although Lactic acid bacteria are generally regarded as safe, there are rare 
cases of the emergence of infections and antibiotic resistance by certain 
probiotics.
OBJECTIVE: An in silico whole genome sequence analysis of putative probiotic 
bacteria was set up to identify strains, predict desirable functional 
properties, and identify potentially detrimental antibiotic resistance and 
virulence genes.
METHODS: We characterized the genomes of three L. plantarum strains (54B, 54C, 
and 55A) isolated from Ethiopian traditional cottage cheese. Whole-genome 
sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The completeness and 
quality of the genome of L. plantarum strains were assessed through CheckM.
RESULTS: Analyses results showed that L. plantarum 54B and 54C are closely 
related but different strains. The genomes studied did not harbor resistance and 
virulence factors. They had five classes of carbohydrate-active enzymes with 
several important functions. Cyclic lactone autoinducer, terpenes, Type III 
polyketide synthases, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified 
peptides-like gene clusters, sactipeptides, and all genes required for 
riboflavin biosynthesis were identified, evidencing their promising probiotic 
properties. Six bacteriocin-like structures encoding genes were found in the 
genome of L. plantarum 55A.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of resistome and virulome and their previous functional 
capabilities suggest the potential applicability of these strains in food 
industries as bio-preservatives and in the prevention and/or treatment of 
infectious diseases. The results also provide insights into the probiotic 
potential and safety of these three strains and indicate avenues for further 
mechanistic studies using these isolates.

Obesity, a global public health problem, is constantly increasing, so the 
concerns in preventing and combating it are increasingly focused on the 
intestinal microbiota. It was found that the microbiota is different in lean 
people compared to obese individuals, but the exact mechanisms by which energy 
homeostasis is influenced are still incompletely known. Numerous studies show 
the involvement of certain bacterial species in promoting obesity and associated 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc. Our aim is to summarize 
the main findings regarding the influence of several factors such as lifestyle 
changes, including diet and bariatric surgery, on the diversity of the gut 
microbiota in obese individuals. The second purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the potential effect of various microbiota modulation techniques on 
ameliorating obesity and its comorbidities. A literature search was conducted 
using the PubMed database, identifying articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
Most studies identified suggest that obesity is generally associated with 
alterations of the gut microbiome such as decreased microbial diversity, an 
increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased SCFAs levels. Our 
findings also indicate that gut microbiota modulation techniques could represent 
a novel strategy in treating obesity and related metabolic diseases. Although 
some mechanisms (e.g., inflammation or hormonal regulation) are already 
considered a powerful connection between gut microbiota and obesity development, 
further research is needed to enhance the knowledge on this particular topic.

The interplay between functional food nutrients and neurosteroids has garnered 
significant attention for its potential to enhance stress resilience in health 
and/or disease. Several bioactive nutrients, including medicinal herbs, 
flavonoids, and bioavailable polyphenol-combined nanoparticles, as well as 
probiotics, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to improve 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, endogenous neurosteroid homeostasis and 
brain function. These nutrients can inhibit oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation, which are linked to the pathogenesis of various neurological 
disorders. Interestingly, flavonoids exhibit dose-dependent effects, activating 
the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway at the 
physiological/low dose (neurohormesis). This leads to the upregulation of 
antioxidant phase II genes and proteins such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and 
sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), which are activated by curcumin and resveratrol, 
respectively. These adaptive neuronal response mechanisms help protect against 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neurotoxicity. Impaired Nrf2 and neurosteroid 
hormone signaling in the brain can exacerbate selective vulnerability to 
neuroinflammatory conditions, contributing to the onset and progression of 
neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, 
anxiety and depression and other neurological disorders, due to the 
vulnerability of neurons to stress. This review focuses on functional food 
nutrients targeting Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and redox resilience genes to 
regulate the neurosteroid homeostasis and BBB damage associated with altered 
GABAergic neurotransmission. By exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms 
using innovative technologies, we aim to develop promising neuroprotective 
strategies and personalized nutritional and neuroregenerative therapies to 
prevent or attenuate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, ultimately 
promoting brain health.

Emerging research into the human microbiome, an intricate ecosystem of 
microorganisms residing in and on our bodies, reveals that it plays a pivotal 
role in maintaining our health, highlighting the potential for microbiome-based 
interventions to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage a myriad of diseases. The 
objective of this review is to highlight the importance of microbiome studies in 
enhancing our understanding of rare genetic epilepsy and related neurological 
disorders. Studies suggest that the gut microbiome, acting through the gut-brain 
axis, impacts the development and severity of epileptic conditions in children. 
Disruptions in microbial composition can affect neurotransmitter systems, 
inflammatory responses, and immune regulation, which are all critical factors in 
the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This growing body of evidence points to the 
potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics or dietary 
modifications, as innovative approaches to managing epilepsy. By harnessing the 
power of the microbiome, we stand to develop more effective and personalized 
treatment strategies for children affected by this disease and other rare 
neurological diseases.

Necrotic enteritis (NE), caused by Clostridium perfringens, represents a major 
economic challenge to poultry production. This study evaluated the effects of 
four plant extracts-Astragalus, pomegranate peel, Sophora flavescens, and 
Artemisia annua-in combination with B. subtilis, as potential antibiotic 
alternatives for controlling NE. Using an experimentally induced NE model 
produced by coinfection with Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens, 288 chickens 
were divided into 12 groups to assess growth performance, intestinal lesions, 
and inflammatory markers. Compared with the enramycin group, the pomegranate 
peel extract group had a 9.9% increase in body weight gain (BWG), significant 
enhancement in claudin-2 expression, and reduced production of inflammatory 
factors. Compared with the infected control group, the combination of A. annua 
extract and B. subtilis resulted in the lowest intestinal lesion scores. The 
claudin-2, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 expression levels in the group 
treated with S. flavescens extract combined with B. subtilis increased to the 
highest levels compared to those in the healthy control group. These findings 
emphasize the potential of plant extracts, particularly pomegranate peel and A. 
annua with B. subtilis, as natural alternatives for NE management in poultry, 
providing a promising approach to reducing reliance on antibiotics.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. These conditions have numerous health consequences and 
significantly impact patients' lifestyles. Effective long-term treatment is 
essential since NCDs are irreversible. Therefore, primary healthcare must be 
both exclusive and of the highest quality, ensuring comprehensive care. The 
primary goal should be to improve quality of life with a focus on patients, 
families, and communities, as most of these diseases can be prevented and 
controlled, although not cured. Several factors have been linked to individual 
health, including social, cultural, and economic aspects, lifestyle, and certain 
environmental factors, including work, that can have positive or negative 
effects. More of these variables may contribute to the onset of NCDs, which are 
defined by their chronic nature, propensity for prolongation, and generally slow 
rate of progression. Examples of NCDs include hypertension, type 2 diabetes 
(T2D), dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease linked to metabolic dysfunction. 
The onset of these diseases has been associated with an imbalance in certain 
microbial niches, such as the gut, which hosts billions of microorganisms 
performing multiple metabolic functions, such as the production of metabolites 
like bile acids (BAs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and trimethylamine 
N-oxide (TMAO). Therefore, lifestyle changes and personal habits can 
significantly impact the gut microbiota (GM), potentially preventing chronic 
diseases associated with metabolism. NCDs are highly prevalent worldwide, 
prompting increased attention to strategies for modifying the intestinal 
microbiota (IM). Approaches such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and 
fecal transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated improvements in the quality of 
life for individuals with these conditions. Additionally, lifestyle changes and 
the adoption of healthy habits can significantly impact IM and may help prevent 
chronic diseases related to metabolism. Therefore, the main aim of this review 
is to analyze and understand the importance of microbiota intervention in the 
prevention of non-communicable diseases. R3:A1.

Background: The gut microbiota constitutes a complex microorganism community 
that harbors bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. The human gut 
bacterial microbiota has been extensively proven to participate in human 
metabolism, immunity, and nutrient absorption. Its imbalance, namely 
"dysbiosis", has been linked to disordered metabolism. Metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is one of the features of 
deranged human metabolism and is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, there is a pathophysiological link between gut 
dysbiosis and MASLD. Aims and Methods: We aimed to review the literature data on 
the composition of the human bacterial gut microbiota and its dysbiosis in MASLD 
and describe the concept of the "gut-liver axis". Moreover, we reviewed the 
approaches for gut microbiota modulation in MASLD treatment. Results: There is 
consolidated evidence of particular gut dysbiosis associated with MASLD and its 
stages. The model explaining the relationship between gut microbiota and the 
liver has a bidirectional organization, explaining the physiopathology of MASLD. 
Oxidative stress is one of the keystones in the pathophysiology of MASLD and 
fibrosis generation. There is promising and consolidated evidence for the 
efficacy of pre- and probiotics in reversing gut dysbiosis in MASLD patients, 
with therapeutic effects. Few yet encouraging data on fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) in MASLD are available in the literature. Conclusions: The 
gut dysbiosis characteristic of MASLD is a key target in its reversal and 
treatment via diet, pre/probiotics, and FMT treatment. Oxidative stress 
modulation remains a promising target for MASLD treatment, prevention, and 
reversal.

Up to the last update, the gut microbiome (GM) had been associated with a 
different physiologic host process, including those affecting cardiovascular 
health. The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is an indicator of 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. The GM influence on atherosclerosis 
progression has garnered growing attention in recent years but the consensus in 
subclinical atherosclerosis remains elusive. The aim of this narrative review is 
to investigate the connection between the GM and carotid IMT, encompassing 
mechanisms like the microbiome impact on metabolite production, and systemic 
inflammation, and its effects on endothelial function. The literature analysis 
revealed that the GM appears to exert an influence on carotid IMT development, 
likely through mechanisms involving metabolites' production, systemic 
inflammation, and endothelial function modulation. Additional research, however, 
is needed to finely elucidate the relationship between the GM and 
atherosclerosis. Specifically, more extensive studies are required to pinpoint 
individuals at the highest risk of developing atherosclerosis based on their GM 
composition. This will facilitate the enhancement and optimization of 
cardiovascular disease prevention strategies and enable the treatments' 
customization for each patient. Further investigations are required to refine 
patient outcomes in the context of probiotics and other interventions aimed at 
improving microbiome composition and function.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated intestinal disease without a 
comprehensive cure, and the alleviation of UC has become an urgent problem. The 
results showed that JY062 with its EPS group (JEC) alleviated the intestinal 
barrier damage caused by LPS. After JEC intervention on Caco-2 cells, resulted 
in upregulation of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin and MUC2 transcript levels and 
decreased mRNA expression of Claudin-2 (p < 0.05). JEC effectively attenuated 
the inflammatory response in UC mice and restoration of immunoglobulin levels 
(IgG, IgM and IgA), which resulted in shortening and swelling of the colon, 
disappearance of goblet cells, infiltration of inflammatory cells and mucosal 
damage were alleviated in mice. Similarly, changes in the expression of MUC2 and 
tight junction proteins after JEC intervention also occurred in UC mice. 
Administration of JEC significantly inhibited the differentiation of 
pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in the thymus and peripheral blood, promoted the 
differentiation of CD4+ T cells to Treg cells, and effectively regulated 
DSS-induced macrophage imbalance, which was manifested by the polarization of 
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This study 
clearly demonstrates that JEC could significantly prevent intestinal barrier on 
DSS-induced experimental colitis and could be applied as a potential symbiotic 
strategy to assist in the alleviation of UC.

The human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microbes that affect the 
body. Dysbiosis in the composition of gut microbiota is one of the leading 
causes of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). IBD is a global public health challenge and millions of people in the 
world are suffering from this disease. It is a recurring inflammatory disease 
that affects different parts of the human digestive system. Ulcerative colitis 
and Crohn's disease are the two main types of IBD with similar clinical 
symptoms. The increasing incidence and severity of IBD require new treatment 
methods. The composition of the gut microbiota can be modified using dietary 
supplements such as prebiotics and bacterial supplements called probiotics. 
Furthermore, the effects of the microbiome can be improved by using 
paraprobiotics (non-viable, inactivated bacteria or their components) and/or 
postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism).

Recent research has emphasized the critical importance of establishing the 
neonatal gut microbiota for overall health and immune system development, 
prompting deeper studies about the early formation of neonatal gut microbiota 
and its influencing factors. Various factors, including maternal and 
environmental factors, affect the early formation of neonatal gut microbiota, in 
which delivery mode has been considered as one of the most crucial influencing 
factors. In recent years, the increasing trend of cesarean section during 
childbirth has become a serious challenge for global public health. This review 
thoroughly analyzes the effects of vaginal delivery and cesarean section on the 
establishment of neonatal gut microbiota and the potential long-term impacts. In 
addition, we analyze and discuss interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, 
vaginal seeding, fecal microbiota transplantation, and breastfeeding to address 
the colonization defects of the neonatal gut microbiota caused by cesarean 
section, aiming to provide theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of 
colonization defects and related diseases in infants caused by cesarean section 
in clinical practice and to provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing the 
development of neonatal gut microbiota.

The burgeoning field of microbiome research has profoundly reshaped our 
comprehension of human health, particularly highlighting the potential of 
probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as therapeutic 
interventions. While the benefits of traditional probiotics are well-recognized, 
the efficacy and mechanisms remain ambiguous, and FMT's long-term effects are 
still being investigated. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have 
identified gut microbes with significant health benefits, paving the way for 
next-generation probiotics (NGPs). These NGPs, engineered through synthetic 
biology and bioinformatics, are designed to address specific disease states with 
enhanced stability and viability. This review synthesizes current research on 
NGP stability, challenges in delivery, and their applications in preventing and 
treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular 
diseases. We explore the physiological characteristics, safety profiles, and 
mechanisms of action of various NGP strains while also addressing the challenges 
and opportunities presented by their integration into clinical practice. The 
potential of NGPs to revolutionize microbiome-based therapies and improve 
clinical outcomes is immense, underscoring the need for further research to 
optimize their efficacy and ensure their safety.

BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common symptom in maintenance hemodialysis 
patients and greatly affects the quality of survival of hemodialysis patients. 
Fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics are feasible treatments for 
functional constipation, but there is still a gap in the research on the 
characteristics of gut flora in patients with maintenance hemodialysis combined 
with constipation. The aim of this study is to clarify the characteristics of 
the intestinal flora and its changes in maintenance hemodialysis patients with 
constipation.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 45 participants, containing 15 in the 
maintenance hemodialysis constipation group,15 in the maintenance hemodialysis 
non-constipation group and 15 in the healthy control group. These samples were 
analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The feature of the intestinal 
microbiome of maintenance hemodialysis constipation group and the microbiome 
differences among the three groups were elucidated by species annotation 
analysis, α-diversity analysis, β-diversity analysis, species difference 
analysis, and predictive functional analysis.
RESULTS: The alpha diversity analysis indicated that maintenance hemodialysis 
constipation group was less diverse and homogeneous than maintenance 
hemodialysis non-constipation group and healthy control group. At the genus 
level, the top ten dominant genera in maintenance hemodialysis constipation 
group patients were Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, 
Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, 
Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia and UCG-002. 
Compared with non-constipation group, the Enterococcus, 
Rhizobiales_unclassified, Filomicrobium, Eggerthella, Allobaculum, Prevotella_7, 
Gordonibacter, Mitochondria_unclassified, Lachnoanaerobaculum were significantly 
higher in constipation group (p<0.05). Compared with non-constipation group, the 
Kineothrix, Rhodopirellula, Weissella were significantly lower in constipation 
group (p<0.05). The predictive functional analysis revealed that compared with 
non-constipation group, constipation group was significantly enriched in 
pathways associated with pyruate metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes for the first time the intestinal microbiome 
characteristics of maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation. The 
results of this study suggest that there is a difference in the intestinal flora 
between maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation and maintenance 
hemodialysis patients without constipation.

Improved maternal nutritional status is hypothesized to promote good pregnancy 
and infant health outcomes but trial evidence supporting the commencement of 
nutritional supplementation before conception is sparse. The NiPPeR (Nutritional 
Intervention Preconception and During Pregnancy to Maintain Healthy Glucose 
Metabolism and Offspring Health) multinational double-blind randomized 
controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and New Zealand 
tested a nutritional formulation containing myo-inositol, probiotics, and 
multiple micronutrients (intervention), compared with a standard micronutrient 
supplement (control), taken at preconception and throughout pregnancy. The 
primary outcome of gestational glycemia at 28 weeks' gestation showed no 
difference. However, differences in several prespecified secondary outcomes were 
notable. The intervention reduced the incidence of preterm delivery particularly 
those associated with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, operative delivery 
for delayed second stage, and major postpartum hemorrhage. It may also shorten 
time to conception in overweight women, to that similar to nonoverweight/obese 
women. Importantly, the intervention associated with a reduction in the 
incidence of rapid infant weight gain and high body mass index at 2 years among 
offspring. Such evidence indicates the potential for preconception maternal 
nutritional interventions to have appreciable impact in shaping the long-term 
health of an individual and building resilience against noncommunicable chronic 
diseases in the future.

Ethanol can directly or indirectly lead to cognitive and mental disorders. The 
long-term intake of alcohol can directly affect the distribution of gut 
microbiota. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a natural bacterium isolated 
from healthy human intestines that has the function of preventing 
cytokine-induced cell apoptosis and protecting cell barriers. However, the 
regulatory effect of LGG on cognitive and mental disorders caused by chronic 
ethanol exposure (CEE) is still unclear. In this study, we established a CEE 
mouse model through free alcohol consumption and added LGG or antibiotics in the 
later stages of the model. Sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that 
CEE resulted in a decrease in the abundance and diversity of mouse gut microbial 
communities accompanied by alterations in the relative abundance of multiple 
enterobacterial genera. The use of LGG and antibiotics alleviated the 
depression-like behaviour and cognitive impairment of CEE-induced mice, reduced 
expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the ileum, serum and brain and increased the 
expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Together, LGG can 
alleviate depression-like behaviour caused by CEE in mice while also improving 
cognitive and memory functions through reducing peripheral and nervous system 
inflammation factors and balancing gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in 
healthcare, prompting exploration into non-pharmacological interventions to 
complement traditional treatments.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the efficacy of lifestyle-based 
interventions in managing AD.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of 
Science, and Scopus between 2018 and 2023, selecting randomized controlled 
trials examining factors such as exercise, diet, stress, and cognitive training 
in AD patients.
RESULTS: The review revealed physical exercise as the predominant 
non-pharmacological intervention, accompanied by dietary modifications, 
cognitive training, and therapies such as mindfulness and music. While exercise 
demonstrated improvements in quality of life, its cognitive benefits were 
limited. Modified diets, such as Atkins and ketogenic, displayed inconsistent 
effects on cognitive function but influenced other health-related parameters. 
Additionally, probiotic therapy and novel cognitive training technologies were 
explored.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite some interventions showing promise in enhancing cognitive 
function and slowing disease progression, uncertainties remain regarding the 
dose-response relationship, underlying mechanisms, and potential synergistic 
effects. Moreover, consideration of genetic and sex-based disparities is 
warranted. This synthesis underscores the need for further research to elucidate 
the nuances of non-pharmacological interventions in managing AD effectively.

Pilots, Astronauts, and the Aerospace Microbiota: A Narrative Review of 
Occupational Impact.

The human microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing 
disease; however, the effects of occupational exposure on the microbiota of 
aircrew and astronauts are not fully understood. This narrative review aims to 
synthesize the current knowledge on microbiota alterations in aerospace 
medicine, assess the potential of probiotics as a countermeasure, and identify 
key gaps that warrant further research. The references were identified through 
searching PubMed for English articles published between 2010 and 2024, using 
keywords related to microbiota, probiotics, aviation, spaceflight, pilots, and 
astronauts. Additionally, the bibliographies of relevant papers were reviewed. 
Studies in aerospace medicine were selected based on their focus on the 
occupational impact on microbiota and the use of probiotics in this context. For 
aircrew, initial studies indicate a decrease in beneficial gut bacteria, 
suggesting that probiotics could enhance gastrointestinal health, immunity, and 
overall well-being. However, unsupervised use of probiotics carries potential 
risks. Conversely, spaceflight induces significant changes in the gut, skin, 
oral, and nasal microbiota of astronauts, characterized by altered diversity and 
abundance of specific microbial taxa. These changes include a relative decrease 
in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, an increase in opportunistic 
pathogens, and evidence of microbial transfer between astronauts and spacecraft 
surfaces. While simulated space studies suggest the potential for probiotics to 
mitigate dysbiosis, direct testing done during actual spaceflight is lacking. 
The observed microbiota changes during spaceflight are associated with various 
health implications, including alterations in metabolic pathways and 
interactions between the microbial metabolic capabilities and the host's 
metabolism. In conclusion, this review highlights the profound impact of 
spaceflight on astronaut microbiota and the promising role of probiotics as an 
intervention in both space and aviation medicine. However, significant research 
gaps remain. These include elucidating the functional implications of microbial 
shifts, developing personalized countermeasures, and validating the efficacy of 
probiotics during spaceflight. Future studies should leverage advanced tools 
such as metagenomic analysis and longitudinal tracking of astronaut health to 
inform targeted interventions that support the well-being of aerospace 
personnel. Integrating data across different sites of the body and missions, 
facilitated by resources like the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), can help 
identify consistent microbial changes induced by the unique occupational 
conditions of spaceflight and aviation. This integrated approach will be crucial 
for developing effective microbiota-based countermeasures to mitigate the 
occupational health risks associated with space and aviation.

Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus grx10 (grx10) has shown promising potential in 
promoting intestinal health as predicted by genomic and metabolomic analyses. 
Given the increasing prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and the limitations 
of existing treatments, exploring alternative therapeutic strategies is 
essential. This study explored the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms 
of grx10 and its derived postbiotic (P-grx10) in a mouse model of dextran 
sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic UC. The intervention with grx10 and P-grx10 
significantly alleviated clinical symptoms and improved biochemical markers in 
UC mice. These effects included reducing the disease activity index (DAI), 
improving colon length and histopathological damage, decreasing the secretion of 
inflammatory cytokines, and preventing the reduction of antioxidant enzymes. 
Additionally, grx10 and P-grx10 downregulated key proteins in the 
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)/myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/myosin 
light chain (MLC) pathway, prevented the dissociation of tight junction (TJ) 
proteins and E-cadherin, reduced intestinal permeability, and restored the 
integrity of the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, both grx10 and P-grx10 
modulated the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, helping to maintain 
intestinal microbiome homeostasis. In conclusion, this study provided evidence 
regarding the role of grx10 and P-grx10 in alleviating intestinal barrier 
dysfunction associated with UC and restoring gut microbiota balance. Notably, 
P-grx10 exhibited higher anti-inflammatory activity and better restoration of 
intestinal barrier function, whereas the live probiotic grx10 showed a stronger 
regulatory effect on the gut microbiota. These findings suggest that grx10 and 
P-grx10 could serve as promising nutritional adjunct therapies for UC, providing 
novel insights into the distinct roles of probiotic and its derived postbiotic 
in UC treatment.

Targeting specific gut microbiota (GM) species to prevent and treat acute upper 
respiratory tract infection (AURTI) has attracted researchers' attention, but 
the relationship between the two is unclear. Based on the summary data from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on GM and five types of AURTIs (acute 
nasopharyngitis (common cold), acute pharyngitis, acute sinusitis, acute upper 
respiratory infections, and acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and 
unspecified sites), we performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship. Through inverse variance 
weighting (IVW) method, we found that 33 potential microbial taxa can influence 
the occurrence of AURTI. Sensitivity analysis showed no potential horizontal 
pleiotropy and heterogeneity bias. We further employed multivariable Mendelian 
randomization to investigate the impact of potential interference factors on the 
significant associations previously identified, considering aspects such as 
comorbidities associated with AURTI, seasonal variations, pathogen specificity, 
and history of antibiotic allergies. Ultimately, 11 microbial taxa remained 
significantly associated. This study provides robust evidence for a causal 
relationship between GM and five types of AURTIs, thereby offering a foundation 
for the development of microbiota-targeted therapies and related probiotic 
interventions aimed at AURTI.

In this study, we observed the effect of the newly isolated probiotic strain 
Limosilactobacillus reuteri B1/1 on the relative gene expression of selected 
cytokines (interleukin-15, transforming growth factor-β4), tight junction 
proteins (E-cadherin, occludin), biomarker active intestinal stem cells - LGR5 
(leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor), markers of mucosal 
intestinal immunity (mucin-2, immunoglobulin A), as well as the creation of a 
new biomarker of inflammation in the intestine - calprotectin on an ex vivo 
model of chicken ileal explant in the prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis PT4 
infection. The ability of L. reuteri B1/1 to effectively modulate the mucosal 
immune response under pretreatment conditions in S. Enteritidis PT4 infection in 
a chicken ileal explant model was confirmed. In addition, our obtained results 
point to the fact that the new chicken ileum explant model could be a suitable 
model to investigate or test the influence of natural substances such as 
probiotic bacteria in the interaction with the intestine as well as pathogenic 
microorganisms. In addition, the results of our study may contribute to a deeper 
understanding of the action of newly isolated probiotic bacteria at the 
intestinal level using ex vivo models such as chicken ileum explant, which are 
able to mimic in vivo conditions sufficiently.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) pose a substantial healthcare challenge, 
exacerbated by the biofilm-forming abilities and antibiotic resistance of 
uropathogens. This study investigated the inhibition of biofilm formation 
(anti-biofilm) and dispersion of pre-established biofilm properties of 18 
heat-killed probiotics and their supernatants against four antibiotic-resistant 
uropathogens: UPEC, Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Methicillin-resistant 
Escherichia coli (MREC), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
pseudintermedius (MRSP). Supernatants from 14 probiotic strains significantly 
(P < 0.001) inhibited UPEC biofilm formation, reducing it by 20-80%, and also 
showed promise in removing existing biofilms by 10-60% (P < 0.001). Eight 
strains significantly (P < 0.05 to < 0.001) inhibited MREC biofilm formation, 
with four strains achieving 50-80% dispersion. Seventeen strains of heat-killed 
probiotics directly inhibited UPEC biofilm formation by 10-60% (P < 0.05 
to < 0.001), but were less effective against MREC and MRSP (10-50% reduction; 
P < 0.05 to < 0.001) and had limited impact on KP (10% reduction; P < 0.05 
to < 0.001). Notably, heat-killed probiotic like LGA, LGC, LGD, TP-8, and TP-4 
showed the most significant inhibitory and dispersion of biofilm activity. 
RT-qPCR analysis further revealed these inactivated probiotics downregulated 
genes associated with pili and biofilm formation (fimA, csgA) and upregulated 
genes linked to quorum sensing (luxS, qseBC, sdiA). Therefore, these findings 
suggest that paraprobiotic treatment could inhibit the formation of pili and 
biofilms and promote biofilm dispersion. In an animal model, mice given 
paraprobiotic formulations I (16 strains) and II (a specific mixture) for 
2 weeks showed reduced urinary bacterial load (P < 0.05). Paraprobiotic I 
notably reduced morbidity from bacteriuria (> 105 CFU/ml) by 5 to 30% within the 
first 5 days post-infection compared to placebo. These findings highlight the 
potential of specific heat-killed probiotics in combating biofilms and 
preventing UTIs.

The prevalence of obesity-associated precocious puberty is gradually increasing, 
but the relationship between gut flora and obesity-associated precocious puberty 
remains unclear.We analysed the gut flora characteristics of a clinical sample 
of 30 girls aged 5-8 years using 16s rRNA sequencing. An obesity rat model and a 
rat model of gut flora transplantation were also constructed. Body weight, body 
length, abdominal girth, food intake, vulva opening time, and gonadal index were 
monitored. The secretion levels of estradiol (E2), total cholesterol (TC), 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroglobulin 
(Tg) were analyzed by ELISA. In addition, ovarian and uterine development was 
observed by HE staining. The mRNA and protein levels of kisspeptin-1 (Kiss-1) 
and gonadotropin-releasing.We found that the relative abundance of Dialister, 
Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and Romboutsia may be associated with 
obesity-associated precocious puberty. Obesity promotes gonadal development, and 
the gut flora of patients with obesity and obesity-associated precocious puberty 
regulated the gene and protein expression of Kiss-1 and GnRH, promoting 
precocious puberty and hypothalamic-gonadal axis hormone secretion in rats. In 
contrast, probiotic intervention slowed gonadal development, reduced hormone 
secretion, and attenuated hypothalamic-gonadal axis activity. Gut flora promoted 
obesity-associated precocious puberty by influencing the hypothalamic-gonadal 
axis, and probiotics have a therapeutic and preventive role in 
obesity-associated precocious puberty, which may be associated with the 
Kiss-1/GnRH pathway. These findings may provide some new strategies for clinical 
treatment and prevention of obesity-associated precocious puberty in girls.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiological studies have associated reduced bacterial 
diversity and abundance and food allergy. This mechanistic review investigated 
the link between gut dysbiosis and food allergy with a focus on the role of 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in modulating T-cells. T-cell differentiation 
poses an opportunity to direct the immune cells towards an anergic regulatory T 
cell (Treg) or allergic T helper 2 (Th2) response. Probiotic intervention to 
prevent and/or treat atopic disease symptoms through this mechanistic pathway 
was explored.
METHODOLOGY: A narrative review was conducted following a three-stage systematic 
literature search of EMBASE and Medline databases. Ninety-six of 571 papers were 
accepted and critically appraised using ARRIVE and SIGN50 forms. Thematic 
analysis identified key pathophysiological mechanisms within the narrative of 
included papers.
RESULTS: Preclinical studies provided compelling evidence for SCFAs' modulation 
of T-cell differentiation, which may act through G-protein coupled receptors 41, 
43 and 109a and histone deacetylase inhibition. Foxp3 transcription factor was 
implicated in the upregulation of Tregs. Human probiotic intervention studies 
aimed at increasing SCFAs and Tregs and preventing atopic disease showed 
inconclusive results. However, evidence for probiotic intervention in children 
with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) was more promising and warrants further 
investigation.
CONCLUSION: Preclinical evidence suggests that the mechanism of gut dysbiosis 
and reduced SCFAs may skew T-cell differentiation towards a Th2 response, thus 
inducing allergy symptoms. Probiotic trials were inconclusive: probiotics were 
predominantly unsuccessful in the prevention of allergic disease, however, may 
be able to modulate food allergy symptoms in infants with CMPA.

This study investigated the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (PTCC 
1643) (LA) and a commercial yeast cell wall prebiotic (Immunogen®) (IM) on 
immunoantioxidant, growth, and digestive status, and resistance to Aeromonas 
hydrophila in Cyprinus carpio juveniles. The fish were fed in five treatments 
including control (T1), LA1.5 (T2): 1.5 (× 10^8 CFU/g of LA)/kg diet, LA3 (T3): 
3 (× 10^8 CFU/g of LA)/kg diet, IM1 (T4): 1 g of IM/kg diet, and IM2 (T5): 2 g 
of IM/ kg diet. After 60 days, the function of growth and intestinal protease 
and amylase showed a significant increase in IM treatments. Serum levels of 
total protein and superoxide dismutase in LA3 treatment, as well as albumin, 
catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in LA3 and IM2 treatments were 
significantly increased. Serum level of malondialdehyde in LA and IM treatments, 
as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in LA treatments, alanine aminotransferase 
in LA and IM2 treatments, and lactate dehydrogenase in LA3 treatment was 
significantly decreased. Serum levels of all the immune parameters in LA3 
treatment, as well as alternative complement pathway hemolytic and nitroblue 
tetrazolium in IM2 treatment were significantly improved. Mucosal level of 
protease in LA3 and IM2 treatments, total immunoglobulin, and lysozyme in LA and 
IM2 treatments, as well as ALP and peroxidase in LA3 treatment was significantly 
increased. Cumulative mortality rate in LA and IM treatments was significantly 
decreased compared to control after the 14-day challenge with A. hydrophila. It 
is recommended to include IM2 in the diet of C. carpio juveniles with regard to 
its beneficial effects on growth and immunity status.

The gut microbiota plays a critical role in maintaining human health, 
influencing a wide range of physiological processes, including immune 
regulation, metabolism, and neurological function. Recent studies have shown 
that imbalances in gut microbiota composition can contribute to the onset and 
progression of various diseases, such as metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity and 
diabetes) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). 
These conditions are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and dysregulated 
immune responses, which are closely linked to specific forms of cell death, 
including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Pathogenic bacteria in the gut can trigger 
these cell death pathways through toxin release, while probiotics have been 
found to mitigate these effects by modulating immune responses. Despite these 
insights, the precise mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences 
these diseases remain insufficiently understood. This review consolidates recent 
findings on the impact of gut microbiota in these immune-mediated and 
inflammation-associated conditions. It also identifies gaps in current research 
and explores the potential of advanced technologies, such as organ-on-chip 
models and the microbiome-gut-organ axis, for deepening our understanding. 
Emerging tools, including single-bacterium omics and spatial metabolomics, are 
discussed for their promise in elucidating the microbiota's role in disease 
development.

Antibiotics are safe, effective drugs and continue to save millions of lives and 
prevent long-term illness worldwide. A large body of epidemiological, 
interventional and experimental evidence shows that exposure to antibiotics has 
long-term negative effects on human health. We reviewed the literature data on 
the links between antibiotic exposure, gut dysbiosis, and chronic disease 
(notably with regard to the "developmental origins of health and disease" 
("DOHaD") approach). Molecular biology studies show that the systemic 
administration of antibiotic to infants has a rapid onset but also often a 
long-lasting impact on the microbial composition of the gut. Along with other 
environmental factors (e.g., an unhealthy "Western" diet and sedentary 
behavior), antibiotics induce gut dysbiosis, which can be defined as the 
disruption of a previously stable, functionally complete microbiota. Gut 
dysbiosis many harmful long-term effects on health. Associations between 
early-life exposure to antibiotics have been reported for chronic diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, some cancers, metabolic 
diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes), allergic diseases, autoimmune disorders, 
atherosclerosis, arthritis, and neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and other 
neurological diseases. In mechanistic terms, gut dysbiosis influences chronic 
disease through direct effects on mucosal immune and inflammatory pathways, plus 
a wide array of direct or indirect effects of short-chain fatty acids, the 
enteric nervous system, peristaltic motility, the production of hormones and 
neurotransmitters, and the loss of intestinal barrier integrity (notably with 
leakage of the pro-inflammatory endotoxin lipopolysaccharide into the 
circulation). To mitigate dysbiosis, the administration of probiotics in 
patients with chronic disease is often (but not always) associated with positive 
effects on clinical markers (e.g., disease scores) and biomarkers of 
inflammation and immune activation. Meta-analyses are complicated by differences 
in probiotic composition, dose level, and treatment duration, and large, 
randomized, controlled clinical trials are lacking in many disease areas. In 
view of the critical importance of deciding whether or not to prescribe 
antibiotics (especially to children), we suggest that the DOHaD concept can be 
logically extended to "gastrointestinal origins of health and disease" ("GOHaD") 
or even "microbiotic origins of health and disease" ("MOHaD").

PURPOSE: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most severe gastrointestinal 
disease in preterm infants caused by an exaggerated intestinal epithelial immune 
activation. Several studies show that modulation of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 
activity may have positive effects on preventing intestinal inflammatory 
mechanisms ultimately resulting in NEC development. In this study, the effect of 
various infant formulas (IF) and the probiotic strain Limosilactobacillus 
fermentum CECT5716 on TLR9 activation were analyzed in vitro.
METHODS: First, TLR4 and TLR9 expression was analyzed on human primary 
intestinal epithelial cells (P-IECs) by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Then 
genetically designed HEK-Dual™ hTLR9 (NF/IL8) reporter cells (HEK-Dual) were 
treated with different IFs, L. fermentum CECT5716, and different functional 
components to measure TLR9 activation via luminescence. Finally, the IFs were 
investigated in P-IECs to analyze TLR downstream signaling by Western blot 
analysis.
RESULTS: IFs containing intact protein and L. fermentum CECT5716 activated TLR9 
in HEK-Dual cells, but the functional components lactoferrin, 
L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and hydrolyzed whey proteins failed to activate 
TLR9. In P-IECs, the IFs induced increased phosphorylation of MAPK8/9 of the TLR 
signaling pathway and significantly reduced IL6 levels. Consistently, IL6 levels 
were increased in P-IECs when TLR9-signaling was inhibited. Interestingly, L. 
fermentum CECT5716 enhanced TLR9-signaling and increased NF-kappa-B inhibitor 
alpha-phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: We found out that the used control formula, prebiotic formula, 
prebiotic formula with hydrolyzed-protein, and L. fermentum CECT5716 reduce IL6 
levels in human P-IECs through TLR9 activation. L. fermentum CECT5716 and the 
here tested IFs could be a promising approach for modulation of gut health in 
infants.

Grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) aquaculture is economically vital due to the high 
value of its roe. However, it faces significant risks from disease outbreaks, 
particularly from Nocardia seriolae. Current reliance on antibiotics has 
drawbacks, highlighting the potential of probiotics as a promising alternative. 
Despite this, no studies have focused on the effects and mechanisms of 
probiotics in disease prevention and treatment in grey mullet. This study, 
therefore, investigates the efficacy of probiotics in enhancing disease 
resistance and promoting growth in grey mullet. Three strains of probiotics, 
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus FS3051, Limosilactobacillus reuteri FS3052, and 
Bacillus subtilis natto NTU-18, were selected to evaluate their anti-N. seriolae 
activity and hydrolytic enzyme secretion in vitro. Then, 144 grey mullet were 
randomly divided into four groups: control, L. rhamnosus FS3051, L. reuteri 
FS3052, and B. subtilis natto NTU-18. After being fed the corresponding diet for 
28 days, fish were measured for immune gene expression and short-term growth 
followed by challenge of N. seriolae. Survival rates were recorded for 35 days 
post challenge. Additionally, the gut microbiota of the control and probiotic 
groups with effects on both growth and protection against N. seriolae were 
analyzed to investigate the potential role of gut microbiota. Results 
demonstrated that L. rhamnosus FS3051 and L. reuteri FS3052 inhibited N. 
seriolae, while B. subtilis natto NTU-18 did not inhibited N. seriolae. 
Probiotics also had the ability to secrete hydrolytic enzymes. Probiotic-fed 
grey mullet showed significant improvements in weight gain ratio, feed 
efficiency, and specific growth rate, particularly in the B. subtilis natto 
NTU-18 group. Immune gene expression was enhanced by probiotics, especially L. 
rhamnosus, FS3051, which induced IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and MHCI. Survival 
rates post-N. seriolae challenge improved significantly for L. rhamnosus 
FS3051-fed fish. L. rhamnosus FS3051 also altered the gut microbiota, enriching 
beneficial genera like Lactobacillus, which correlated positively with immune 
responses and growth, while reducing Mycoplasma and Rhodobacter, which were 
negatively correlated with immune responses. This study underscores the 
potential of probiotics in enhancing disease resistance and growth via 
regulating gut microbiota in grey mullet.

Saccharomyces boulardii, as a probiotic yeast, has shown great potential in 
regulating gut health and treating gastrointestinal diseases. Due to its unique 
antimicrobial and immune-regulating functions, it has become a significant 
subject of research in the field of probiotics. In this study, we aim to enhance 
the antioxidant properties of S. boulardii by producing l-ergothioneine (EGT). 
We first constructed a double knockout of ura3 and trp1 gene in S. boulardii to 
facilitate plasmid-based expressions. To further enable effective genome editing 
of S. boulardii, we implemented the PiggyBac system to transpose the 
heterologous gene expression cassettes into the chromosomes of S. boulardii. By 
using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as the reporter gene, we 
achieved random chromosomal integration of EGFP expression cassette. By using 
PiggyBac transposon system, a great variety of EGT-producing strains was 
obtained, which is not possible for the conventional single target genome 
editing, and one best isolated top producer reached 17.50 mg/L EGT after 120 h 
cultivation. In summary, we have applied the PiggyBac transposon system to S. 
boulardii for the first time for genetic engineering. The engineered probiotic 
yeast S. boulardii has been endowed with new antioxidant properties and produces 
EGT. It has potential applications in developing novel therapeutics and dietary 
supplements for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

Time-restricted eating (TRE) has been shown to extent lifespans in drosophila 
and mouse models by affecting metabolic and anti-inflammatory activities. 
However, the effect of TRE on the human immune system, especially on 
immunosenescence, intestinal microbiome, and metabolism remains unclear. We 
conducted a 30-day 16:8 TRE single-arm clinical trial with 49 participants. 
Participants consumed daily meals from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., provided by a nutrition 
canteen with a balanced, calorie-appropriate nutrition, which is designed by 
clinical nutritionists (ChiCTR2200058137). We monitored weight changes and 
weight-related parameters and focused on changes in the frequency of CD4+ 
senescent T cells, immune repertoire from peripheral blood, as well as serum 
metabolites and gut microbiota. We found that up to 95.9 % of subjects 
experienced sustained weight loss after TRE. The frequency of circulating 
senescent CD4+ T cells was decreased, while the frequency of Th1, Treg, 
Tfh-like, and B cells was increased. Regarding the immune repertoire, the 
proportions of T cell receptor alpha and beta chains were increased, whereas B 
cell receptor kappa and lambda chains were reduced. In addition, a reduced class 
switch recombination from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to immunoglobulin A (IgA) was 
observed. TRE upregulated the levels of anti-inflammatory and anti-aging serum 
metabolites named sphingosine-1-phosphate and prostaglandin-1. Additionally, 
several anti-inflammatory bacteria and probiotics were increased, such as 
Akkermansia and Rikenellaceae, and the composition of the gut microbiota tended 
to be "younger". Overall, TRE showed multiple anti-aging effects, which may help 
humans maintain a healthy lifestyle to stay "young". Clinical Trial Registration

AIMS: This research sought to assess the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis (B. 
subtilis) R0179 and explore potential metabolites in mitigating experimental 
periodontitis in mice induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) ATCC 
33277.
METHODS: B. subtilis R0179 was administered to 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice 
with periodontitis. Oral load of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and periodontal tissue 
loss were quantified. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) was separated to assess 
its anti-P. gingivalis effect. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses identified 
potential antibacterial components in the CFS, further evaluated for anti-P. 
gingivalis effects.
RESULTS: B. subtilis R0179 significantly reduced P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 levels 
and mitigated periodontal tissue loss in mice. The CFS, rather than inactivated 
B. subtilis R0179 cells, exhibited antibacterial activity. Proteomic and 
metabolomic analyses identified mesaconate and citraconate as key antibacterial 
agents. Disk diffusion assays confirmed the efficacy of mesaconate against P. 
gingivalis, while citraconate had no effect. Mesaconate showed a dose-dependent 
reduction in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 population and periodontal tissue loss in 
mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight B. subtilis R0179 and its metabolite 
mesaconate as promising candidates for therapeutic development against 
periodontitis by inhibiting P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 effectively.

Bacillus velezensis is a species of Bacillus that has been widely investigated 
because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, most studies on 
B. velezensis have focused on the biocontrol of plant diseases, with few reports 
on antagonizing Salmonella Typhimurium infections. In this investigation, it was 
discovered that B. velezensis HBXN2020, which was isolated from healthy black 
pigs, possessed strong anti-stress and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. 
Importantly, B. velezensis HBXN2020 did not cause any adverse side effects in 
mice when administered at various doses (1×107, 1×108, and 1×109 CFU) for 14 
days. Supplementing B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores, either as a curative or 
preventive measure, dramatically reduced the levels of S. Typhimurium ATCC14028 
in the mice's feces, ileum, cecum, and colon, as well as the disease activity 
index (DAI), in a model of infection caused by this pathogen in mice. 
Additionally, supplementing B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores significantly 
regulated cytokine levels (Tnfa, Il1b, Il6, and Il10) and maintained the 
expression of tight junction proteins and mucin protein. Most importantly, 
adding B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores to the colonic microbiota improved its 
stability and increased the amount of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and 
Akkermansia). All together, B. velezensis HBXN2020 can improve intestinal 
microbiota stability and barrier integrity and reduce inflammation to help treat 
infection by S. Typhimurium.

Various problems and obstacles are encountered during pig farming, especially 
the weaning phase when switching from liquid to solid feed. Infection by 
pathogenic bacteria causes damage to the intestinal barrier function of piglets, 
disrupts the balance of the intestinal microbiota, and destroys the chemical, 
mechanical, and immune barriers of the intestinal tract, which is one of the 
main causes of gut inflammation or gut diseases in piglets. The traditional 
method is to add antibiotics to piglet diets to prevent bacterial infections. 
However, long-term overuse of antibiotics leads to bacterial resistance and 
residues in animal products, threatening human health and causing gut microbiota 
dysbiosis. In this context, finding alternatives to antibiotics to maintain pre- 
and post-weaning gut health in piglets and prevent pathogenic bacterial 
infections becomes a real emergency. The utilization of probiotics in piglet 
nutrition has emerged as a pivotal strategy to promote gut health and defend 
against pathogenic infections, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional 
antibiotic usage. This review introduces recent findings that underscore the 
multifaceted roles of probiotics in enhancing piglet welfare, from fortifying 
the gut barrier to mitigating the impacts of common bacterial pathogens. 
Meanwhile, this study introduces the functions of probiotics from different 
perspectives: positive effects of probiotics on piglet gut health, protecting 
piglets against pathogen infection, and the mechanisms of probiotics in 
preventing pathogenic bacteria.

Helicobacter pylori is a highly prevalent pathogen in human gastric mucosa 
epithelial cells with strong colonization ability. Weizmannia coagulans is a 
kind of active microorganism that is beneficial to the improvement of host gut 
microbiota balance and can prevent and treat intestinal diseases. We 
investigated the beneficial effects of W. coagulans BC99 in H. pylori infected 
mice and measured inflammation response, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota. 
Results showed that BC99 could alleviate the gastric inflammation, inhibit the 
increasing of inflammation parameters endotoxin, interleukin-10, transforming 
growth factor-β, and interferon-γ and oxidative stress myeloperoxidase and 
malondialdehyde, promote the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase. 
Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that BC99 reversed the 
change of gut microbiota by reducing the abundance of Olsenella, 
Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Monoglobus, and increasing the abundance of 
Tyzzerella. Meanwhile, BC99 caused elevated levels of Ligilactobacillus and 
Lactobacillus. In view of the beneficial effect of BC99 on the content of 
short-chain fatty acid, valeric acid with sodium valerate interfered with H. 
pylori infection in mice found that valeric acid had a good restorative effect 
of H. pylori infection relating inflammation and oxidative stress responses. 
These results suggest that W. coagulans BC99 can be used as a potential 
probiotic to prevent and treat H. pylori infection by regulating the 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease, but 
there is currently no effective treatment method. Probiotics have been used as 
an adjunct therapy for NAFLD, but the mechanism is not clear. This study used 
Bifidobacterium longum BL19 (BL-19) to treat the NAFLD mice induced by a 
high-fat diet, and explored the treatment mechanism through gut microbiota and 
serum metabolomics techniques. We found that BL-19 effectively prevented rapid 
weight gain in NAFLD mice and reduced their overall food and energy intake, 
decreased liver inflammatory factors expressions, and increased the bile acid 
synthetase enzyme CYP7A1 and superoxide dismutase. After BL-19 treatment, the 
abundances of butyric acid bacteria (Oscillospira and Coprococcus) in the feces 
of mice increased significantly, and the concentration of butyric acid also 
increased significantly. We believe that BL-19 promotes the production of 
butyrate in the intestines, which in turn regulates the activity of CYP7A1 in 
the liver and bile acid synthesis, ultimately treating liver inflammation and 
lipid accumulation in NAFLD mice. Serum metabolomics results indicated that 
BL-19 affected multiple pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism in 
NAFLD mice. These findings suggest that BL-19 shows promise as an adjunct 
therapy for NAFLD, as it can significantly improve oxidative stress, reduce 
inflammation in the liver, and decrease lipid accumulation.

This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between gut 
microbiota, diet, and insulin resistance, emphasizing the novel roles of 
diet-induced microbial changes in influencing metabolic health. It highlights 
how diet significantly influences gut microbiota composition, with different 
dietary patterns fostering diverse microbial communities. These diet-induced 
changes in the microbiome impact human metabolism by affecting inflammation, 
energy balance, and insulin sensitivity, particularly through microbial 
metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Focusing the key mediators 
like endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, and introduces personalized 
microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, it also investigates the effects of 
dietary components-fiber, polyphenols, and lipids-on microbiota and insulin 
sensitivity, along with the roles of protein intake and amino acid metabolism. 
The study compares the effects of Western and Mediterranean diets on the 
microbiota-insulin resistance axis. Therapeutic implications, including 
probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and personalized diets, are 
discussed. Key findings reveal that high-fat diets, especially those rich in 
saturated fats, contribute to dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, 
while high-fiber diets promote beneficial bacteria and SCFAs. The review 
underscores the future potential of food and microbiota interventions for 
preventing or managing insulin resistance.

Constipation is a gastrointestinal (GI) condition marked by difficulty in 
defecation, abdominal pain and distension, significantly impacting both physical 
and mental health. Ligilactobacillus salivarius Li01 (Li01) is a probiotic known 
to prevent constipation in mice, while psyllium husk (PSH) is a dietary fiber 
with high water retention, acting as an intestinal lubricant. This study 
investigates the effects of a combined treatment of Li01 and PSH on mice with 
loperamide-induced constipation. The combination treatment improved GI transit 
rates, increased the water content of feces, and regulated serum concentrations 
of GI hormones more effectively than either Li01 or PSH alone. The beneficial 
effects were linked to higher levels of butyric acid and a greater proportion of 
non-12-OH bile acids (BAs) in the GI tract. These protective effects were not 
influenced by changes in gut microbiota. Additionally, Li01 produced butyric 
acid and fermented PSH in vitro. Our findings suggest that the probiotic Li01 
and the prebiotic PSH synergistically protect against constipation in mice, 
highlighting their potential as functional food components.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease with 
intricate pathogenesis, and clinical treatment is still not ideal. The imbalance 
of gut microbiota is associated with IBD progression. Various probiotics have 
been used as functional foods for the prevention and treatment of IBD, but the 
specific mechanism is still not fully understood. Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. 
johnsonii) is a potential anti-inflammatory bacterium, and compared to other 
probiotic Lactobacillus species, its colonization in the gut of colitis patients 
is significantly reduced. In this study, we first found that dietary L. 
johnsonii exerts strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in colitis 
mice, and this beneficial effect is directly related to its derived 
extracellular vesicles (LJ-EVs). Further experimental results indicate that 
LJ-EVs effectively prevented colitis symptoms and modulated gut microbiota and 
metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, we have studied for the first time the protective 
effect of LJ-EVs on the intestinal barrier from the perspective of reducing 
oxidative stress. We found that LJ-EVs can be directly taken up by intestinal 
epithelial cells and activate the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway, 
reducing endotoxin damage to cells and maintaining intestinal barrier 
homeostasis, which cascades to alleviate intestinal inflammation response. This 
study reveals the mechanism of L. johnsonii in treating colitis and provides a 
new approach for the development of oral LJ-EVs for the treatment of colitis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced organ failure and high mortality are largely ascribed 
to the failure of bacterial clearance from the infected tissues. Recently, 
probiotic bacteria-released extracellular vesicles (BEVs) have been implicated 
as critical mediators of intercellular communication which are widely involved 
in the regulation of the inflammatory response. However, their functional role 
in macrophage phagocytosis during sepsis has never been explored.
METHODS: BEVs were collected from three different strains of probiotics 
including Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 (LP WCFS1), Lactobacillus 
rhamnosus Gorbach-Goldin (LGG), and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), or from 
LGG cultured under three pH conditions (pH5-acid, pH6.5-standard, pH8-akaline) 
through differential centrifugation, filtration, and ultracentrifugation of 
their culture supernatants. In vitro phagocytosis was measured in Raw264.7 cells 
and bone marrow-derived macrophages using pHrodo red E. coli BioParticles. The 
in vivo therapeutic effects of BEVs were tested using a 
feces-injection-in-peritoneum (FIP) model of polymicrobial sepsis.
RESULTS: LGG-derived EVs (BEVLGG) were the best among these three probiotics 
BEVs in stimulating macrophages to take up bacteria. Furthermore, BEVLGG 
collected from pH8 culture condition (BEVpH8) exhibited the strongest capacity 
of phagocytosis, compared with BEVpH5 and BEVpH6.5. Treatment of septic mice 
with BEVpH8 significantly prolonged animal survival; increased bacterial 
clearance from the blood, peritoneal lavage fluid, and multiple organs; and 
decreased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, as well as 
reduced multiple organ injuries, in comparison with control-treated septic mice. 
Mechanistically, RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis identified that the FPR1/2 
signaling was remarkably activated, along with its downstream pathways 
(PI3K-Akt-MARCO and NADPH-ROS) in BEVpH8-treated macrophages, compared with 
control cells. Accordingly, pre-addition of Boc2, a specific antagonist of 
FPR1/FPR2, to macrophages significantly attenuated BEVpH8-mediated phagocytosis, 
compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LGG-derived BEVs may have therapeutic 
effects against sepsis-induced organ injury and mortality through enhancing 
FPR1/2-mediated macrophage phagocytosis.

Campylobacteriosis is among the most reported zoonoses in the world, caused by 
species of Campylobacter, this disease is characterized by gastroenteritis in 
humans. The main species involved is Campylobacter jejuni, followed by 
Campylobacter coli. Contaminated chicken meat is often identified as an 
important source of infection related to human cases and Brazil is the largest 
exporter of chicken meat in the world, which makes the characterization of 
brazilian isolates crucial for the establishment of control measures. The 
objective was to evaluate the contamination of chilled and frozen carcasses sold 
in the Northeast of Brazil, by Campylobacter species, identify virulence genes, 
evaluate bacterial resistance to antibiotics and verify the antimicrobial action 
of the Crude Extract Containing Enterocins (CECE) produced by a probiotic strain 
of Enterococcus faecium. In this study, 12 chilled carcasses and 12 frozen 
carcasses were collected, sold retail in supermarkets. The following regions of 
the carcass were sampled: breast skin, wing skin, belly skin, neck skin, gizzard 
and liver. Samples of chicken carcasses were analyzed following ISO 10272-2 
guidelines for the isolation of Campylobacter spp. The isolates were tested by 
PCR to identify genus, species C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari and genes cdtA, 
cdtB, cdtC, sodB, dnaJ, cmeA, cmeB, cmeC. The assessment of susceptibility to 
antibiotics was carried out using the standard disk diffusion method and the 
antimicrobial activity of CECE was determined using the Minimum Inhibitory 
Concentration (MIC), the methodologies followed the recommendations and cutoff 
points according to EUCAST and CLSI. A total of 376 isolates of Campylobacter 
spp. were obtained, among these, 26 (7.0%) were positive for C. jejuni and no 
isolates were detected for C. coli and C. lari. The highest frequency of C. 
jejuni was obtained in chilled carcasses with 23 isolates (88.5%, p < 0.0001), 
in frozen carcasses three isolates were obtained (11.5%). The most frequency 
site of C. jejuni was the chest skin (7/27.0%), followed by skin of the wing 
(6/23.0%), skin of the cloaca (5/19.0%), gizzard (4/15.0%), skin of the neck 
(2/8.0%) and liver (2/8.0%), no significant differences were found between the 
sites sampled. The gene frequency was determined in: cdtA (3/11.5%), cdtB 
(3/11.5%), cdtC (5/19.0%), sodB (9/34.5%), dnaJ (3/11.5%), cmeA (4/15.0%), cmeB 
(4/15.0%) and cmeC (4/15.0%). The three efflux pump genes were amplified in four 
isolates (15.3%) and all tested genes were amplified in three isolates (11.5%). 
All C. jejuni isolates (26/100.0%) were found to be multiresistant to three or 
more classes of antimicrobials. The index of multiple resistance to 
antimicrobial drugs (IRMA) ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 among isolates of C. jejuni. 
The antimicrobial activity of CECE was able to inhibit at least 98.5% of the 
growth of all C. jejuni isolates. Therefore, chilled chicken carcasses present a 
greater risk of contamination than frozen carcasses, for this reason it is 
necessary to adopt practices that avoid cross-contamination during the 
preparation of chicken meat, in order to prevent campylobacteriosis. 
Furthermore, the presence of multiresistant and potentially virulent isolates 
highlights the need for further investigations to better understand the use of 
enterocins as alternative methods in the control of Campylobacter.

Pathogenic blue ear disease caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome virus (PRRSV) bring severe loss to breeding industry due to high 
infectivity and mortality. L. plantarum serves as the probiotic host strain, 
known for its beneficial properties in the gut microbiota. E. coli is used as a 
cloning host for the initial genetic engineering steps, facilitating the 
construction and amplification of the desired genetic constructs. In this study, 
using synthetic biology technology, we constructed engineered probiotics which 
could adhere and display nanobody on the surface to neutralize virus. Firstly, 
we screen an optimal nanobody to effectively bind with PRRSV by building 
library, expression and purification. Then, the integration of adhesion protein 
and nanobody into the genome of probiotics significantly improved its adhesion 
to IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, this engineered probiotic is almost non-toxic to 
cells with good safety, which can be used as a daily probiotics to prevent virus 
fecal transmission. Our study proposed this novel construction strategy of 
engineering probiotics with both adhesion and neutralization effects, which 
provided a new therapeutic view for intestinal virus clearance.

Western dietary pattern is one of the main contributors to the increased risk of 
obesity and chronic diseases, through oxidative stress and inflammation, that 
are the two key mechanisms targeting metabolic organs, such as skeletal muscle 
and adipose tissue. The chronic exposure to high levels of dietary fatty acids 
can increase the amount of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, altering 
glucose homeostasis and contributing to a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative 
capacity. Probiotic administration is a promising approach as preventive 
strategy to attenuate metabolic damage induced by Western diet. Here, we 
investigated the beneficial effect of Limosillactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 on 
the inflammatory state and oxidative balance in the skeletal muscle and adipose 
tissue of adult rats fed a western diet for 8 weeks, focusing on the role of 
skeletal muscle mitochondria. Limosillactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 
administration protected the skeletal muscle from mitochondrial dysfunction and 
oxidative stress, preventing the establishment of inflammation and insulin 
resistance. Interestingly, a further beneficial effect of the probiotic was 
exerted on body composition, favoring the deposition of protein mass and 
preventing adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation. These results open the 
possibility for the use of this probiotic in therapeutic approaches for 
nutrition-related diseases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fixed orthodontic appliances interfere with daily 
oral care procedures, causing more plaque accumulation and thus increasing the 
risk of periodontal diseases. Probiotics have been suggested to maintain oral 
health using beneficial bacteria. However, the evidence to determine the 
clinical benefits of probiotics as a supplement to oral health in orthodontic 
patients is still insufficient. This trial aimed to investigate the protective 
effect of probiotics on oral health and prevent the development of inflammation 
of the gingiva and periodontal tissues during orthodontic treatment using fixed 
orthodontic appliances.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-blinded, single-center, two-arm 
randomized controlled trial conducted between March 2023 and June 2024. A total 
of 50 patients (13 males (26%) and 37 females (74%) with a mean age of 
21.33±2.04) who required a non-extraction-based treatment using fixed 
orthodontic appliances were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: the 
probiotics group (PG) who underwent orthodontic treatment with probiotic tablets 
of Lactobacillus reuteri and the control group (CG) who underwent orthodontic 
treatment without probiotics. The following periodontal parameters were 
recorded: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), papillary bleeding index 
(PBI), and probing depth (PD). These indices were assessed three times: before 
the start of orthodontic treatment (T0) and after three months (T1) and after 
six months (T2) of applying fixed appliances.
RESULTS: The mean values for PI, GI, PBI, and PD were statistically 
significantly lower in the PG compared to the CG at both time points T2 and T3 
(p<0.05). In the PG, there was a significant difference in the PI between time 
points T0 and T1 (p<0.001), but there was no significant difference between T1 
and T2 (p=0.074). The GI, PBI, and PD differences were also insignificant 
(p>0.05). Conversely, all studied periodontal parameters significantly increased 
during the assessment periods in the CG (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Using probiotic lozenges that contain Lactobacillus reuteri, 
alongside regular teeth brushing, during the first six months of fixed 
orthodontic treatment in adults can help maintain good oral hygiene. This 
approach reduces plaque buildup and helps prevent the onset of clinical signs 
associated with periodontal disease.

BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
(AAD), but practical guidelines are sparse. This trial evaluated the efficacy 
and safety of a high-dose, multistrain probiotic mix (Sinquanon), specially 
designed for prevention of AAD in adults.
METHODS: A phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group clinical trial was conducted over 5 months. Participants 
receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered the specialized probiotic 
mix or placebo from the first dose of antibiotics until 14 days after the last 
antibiotic dose. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of AAD.
RESULTS: In total, 564 participants were randomized (probiotic mix: 285; 
placebo: 279), of which 9 participants discontinued the trial early (probiotic 
mix: 3; placebo: 6), had no efficacy data, and were excluded from the efficacy 
analysis. The 555 remaining participants completed the trial and were included 
in the efficacy analysis (probiotic mix: 282; placebo: 273). AAD occurred less 
frequently in the studied probiotic mix versus placebo group (9.2% vs 25.3%, P < 
.001), resulting in an absolute risk reduction of 16% and a number needed to 
treat of 6 (95% confidence interval, 4.55-10.49). A significant improvement in 
the average gastrointestinal quality of life in the studied probiotic mix versus 
placebo group was also observed. There were no clinically relevant differences 
in the incidence of adverse events between the studied probiotic mix and the 
placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: The specially designed high-dose, multistrain probiotic mix 
(Sinquanon) demonstrated to be beneficial compared with placebo in the 
prevention of AAD in adults who received broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to summarize the evidence-base for these 
interventions with a focus on the role of specific chemicals in driving AD.
METHODS: A narrative review of nonprescription mitigation strategies in AD was 
conducted.
RESULTS: We identified avoidance strategies for the various routes of exposure 
such as air pollution, water contamination, or inclusion in home goods, skin 
care products, and cleansers. Evidence for and against dietary modification and 
emollient use as primary prevention were also elucidated. To remember these 
interventions we propose a mnemonic, HELPSS AD: Home decor, Emollients, 
Laundering, Probiotics, Soaks, Social support, Air quality, and Diet.
LIMITATIONS: Each of these categories presents nuanced molecular differences 
that must be considered. For example, probiotic responses vary by the specific 
species while home products and pollution must be analyzed by the specific 
toxins.
CONCLUSION: Although the interventions discussed lack the level of evidence 
required for inclusion into formal guidelines, awareness of these approaches may 
offer aid to, and build trust with, patients and caregivers.

Dental caries, the most prevalent oral infectious disease, is closely associated 
with Streptococcus mutans. This study investigates the antimicrobial properties 
of the temporin-GHb peptide and its derivatives (GHbR, GHbK, and GHb3K) against 
S. mutans. These peptides exhibited potent anti-S. mutans activity through a 
membrane-disruptive mechanism, confirmed by flow cytometry and fluorescence 
staining assays while showing lower bactericidal effects on beneficial probiotic 
bacteria. Additionally, they inhibited the biofilm matrix formation by 
disrupting extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, as demonstrated by 
zymography, qRT-PCR, and sucrose metabolism experiments. In a rat model of S. 
mutans-induced dental caries, treatment with these peptides significantly 
reduced the incidence of dental lesions. H&E staining analysis of rat oral 
tissues confirmed the biosafety of GHb and GHb3K. These findings suggest that 
temporin-derived peptides effectively target EPS, inhibiting biofilm formation 
and virulence, offering a promising strategy for preventing dental caries and 
promoting oral health. The findings suggest potential applications for 
peptide-based interventions to mitigate biofilm-related issues across various 
fields, including agriculture, food processing, and healthcare.

INTRODUCTION: We present a robust and up-to-date synthesis of evidence on the 
effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat newborn infections in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs). Newborn infection prevention interventions 
included strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), prevention of 
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), clean birth kits (CBKs), chlorhexidine 
cleansing, topical emollients, and probiotic and synbiotic supplementation. 
Interventions to treat suspected neonatal infections included prophylactic 
systemic antifungal agents and community-based antibiotic delivery for possible 
serious bacterial infections (PSBIs).
METHODS: A descriptive review combining different methodological approaches was 
conducted. To provide the most suitable recommendations for real-world 
implementation, our analyses considered the impact of these interventions within 
three distinct health settings: facility, mixed, and community.
RESULTS: In facility settings, the strongest evidence supported the 
implementation of multimodal stewardship interventions for AMR reduction and 
device-associated infection prevention bundles for HAI prevention. Emollients in 
preterm newborns reduced the risk of invasive infection compared to routine skin 
care. Probiotics in preterm newborns reduced neonatal mortality, invasive 
infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) risks compared to standard care 
or placebo. There was insufficient evidence for synbiotics and prophylactic 
systemic antifungals in LMICs. In mixed settings, CBKs reduced neonatal 
mortality risk compared to standard care. In community settings, chlorhexidine 
umbilical cord cleansing reduced omphalitis risk compared to dry cord care. For 
the treatment of PSBIs, purely domiciliary-based antibiotic delivery reduced the 
risk of all-cause neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital 
referral.
CONCLUSION: Strategies for preventing HAIs and reducing AMR in healthcare 
facilities should be multimodal, and strategy selection should consider the 
feasibility of integration within existing newborn care programs. Probiotics are 
effective for facility-based use in preterm newborns; however, the establishment 
of high-quality, cost-effective mass production of standardized formulations is 
needed. Chlorhexidine cord cleansing is effective in community settings to 
prevent omphalitis in contexts where unhygienic cord applications are prevalent. 
Community-based antibiotic delivery of simplified regimens for PSBIs is a safe 
alternative when hospital-based care in LMICs is not possible or is declined by 
parents. More randomized trial evidence is needed to establish the effectiveness 
of CBKs, emollients, synbiotics, and prophylactic systemic antifungals in LMICs.

The rapid increase in microbial antibiotic resistance in Clostridioides 
difficile (C. difficile) strains and the formation of hypervirulent strains have 
been associated with a global increase in the incidence of C. difficile 
infection (CDI) and subsequently, an increase in the rate of recurrence. These 
consequences have led to an urgent need to develop new and promising alternative 
strategies to control this pathogen. Engineered probiotics are exciting new 
bacterial strains produced by editing the genome of the original probiotics. 
Recently, engineered probiotics have been used to develop delivery vehicles for 
vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Recent studies have demonstrated 
engineered probiotics may potentially be an effective approach to control or 
treat CDI. This review provides a brief overview of the considerations for 
engineered probiotics for medicinal use, with a focus on recent preclinical 
research using engineered probiotics to prevent or treat CDI. We also address 
the challenges faced in the production of engineered strains and how they may be 
overcome in the application of these agents to meet patient needs in the future.

Aquaponic systems are food production systems that combine aquaculture and 
hydroponic in a closed recirculation system where water provides nutrients to 
plants while plants purify water for fish. In this system, tilapia is the most 
commonly cultured fish and can be easily integrated with vegetable cultivation. 
However, tilapia host a diverse microbiota some of which are pathogenic and can 
infect humans. Previous studies have reported contamination of lettuce by 
pathogenic bacteria which can cause human diseases. Thus, there is an urgent 
need to employ effective methods to control those bacteria, and Bacillus strains 
have been successfully used in this context. This systematic review aimed to 
provide a comprehensive overview of lettuce contamination by pathogenic bacteria 
and the use of Bacillus as probiotics to prevent diseases in aquaponics systems. 
This systematic review was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Statement (PRISMA) Guidelines. A total of 
1,239 articles were retrieved and based on eligibility criteria, six articles 
were included after screening. The review revealed that Enterobacteriaceae, 
Coliforms, and Shiga Toxin-producing E. coli are the predominant bacteria 
contaminating lettuce leaves in Aquaponic systems, and Shiga Toxin-Producing E. 
coli can internalize in the lettuce leaves, putting public health at risk. The 
included studies did not report the presence of V. cholerae in lettuce grown in 
aquaponic systems, and the use of Bacillus as probiotics to control Escherichia 
coli and Vibrio Cholerae. Further research is needed to explore the potential of 
tilapia to act as a source of pathogenic bacteria that can contaminate lettuce, 
as well as to investigate the effectiveness of Bacillus strains as probiotics to 
control these bacteria and ensure food safety.

A high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with various adverse health outcomes, 
including cognitive impairment and an elevated risk of neurodegenerative 
conditions. This relationship is partially attributed to the influence of an HFD 
on the gut microbiota. The objective of this research was to evaluate the 
neuroprotective benefits of co-fermented black barley and quinoa with 
Lactobacillus (FG) against cognitive impairments triggered by an HFD and to 
investigate the microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms involved. C57BL/6J mice 
were randomized into four groups: the normal control group (NC, n = 10), the 
high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10), the high-fat diet group supplemented with FG 
(HFG, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10), and the high-fat diet group supplemented with 
Lactobacillus (HFL, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10). Our results showed that the FG 
intervention enhanced the behavioral and locomotor skills of the mice, elevated 
the levels of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NPI) in brain tissues, and 
alleviated synaptic ultrastructural damage in the hippocampus. Furthermore, FG 
intervention was observed to exert a protective effect on both the blood-brain 
barrier and the colonic barrier, as evidenced by an increase in the mRNA levels 
of Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), Claudin-4, and Occludin in the hippocampus and 
colon. These beneficial effects may be attributed to FG's regulation of gut 
microbiota dysbiosis, which involves the restoration of intestinal flora 
diversity, reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, and a decrease 
in the levels of pro-inflammatory bacteria such as s_Escherichia coli E and 
g_Escherichia; moreover, there was an increase in the abundances of 
anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as s_Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and 
s_Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the FG 
treatment downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathway and upregulated 
neurotransmitter biosynthetic pathways. These probiotic effects of FG resulted 
in reduced production and "leakage" of LPS and decreased mRNA expression of 
Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), and myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) in hippocampal and colon tissues. 
Consequently, a reduction was observed in the levels of inflammatory cytokines 
in the serum, hippocampus, and colon, along with suppression of the 
immunoreactivity of microglia and astrocytes. Our results suggest that FG may 
serve as an intervention strategy for preventing cognitive impairments caused by 
an HFD.

The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) imposes a substantial 
burden on public health and healthcare expenditures, thereby driving the pursuit 
of cost-effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence 
suggests a potential association between dysbiosis of gut microbiota and its 
metabolites with T2DM, indicating that targeted interventions aimed at 
modulating gut microbiota may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the 
management of T2DM. In this review, we concentrated on the multifaceted 
interactions between the gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier in the 
context of T2DM. We systematically summarized that the imbalance of beneficial 
gut microbiota and its metabolites may constitute a viable therapeutic approach 
for the management of T2DM. Meanwhile, the mechanisms by which gut microbiota 
interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, 
synergistically improve insulin resistance in T2DM are summarized. These 
mechanisms include the restoration of gut microbiota structure, upregulation of 
intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of 
tight junction protein expression, promotion of mucin secretion by goblet cells, 
and the immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) and M2 
macrophages. Collectively, these actions contribute to the amelioration of the 
body's metabolic inflammatory status. Our objective is to furnish evidence that 
supports the clinical application of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in 
the management of T2DM.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus, whose persistent 
infection is the main reason for invasive cervical cancer (ICC), which is the 
fourth most common type of cancer in women, with more than 500 000 new cases 
every year. After infection, various alterations occur in the host, facilitating 
the virus's evasion of immune system clearance and promoting its proliferation. 
Oral probiotic consumption can influence the whole body's immunity, inflammatory 
reflection, neural, endocrine humoral, metabolic pathways and other organs by 
adjusting the components of gut microbiota (GM). Some evidence shows there is a 
tight connection between GM and vaginal microbiota (VM), which is referred to as 
the gut-vaginal axis. This review investigates the potential role of probiotics 
in clearing HPV via the gut-vagina axis, emphasizing the effectiveness of 
Lactobacillus in preventing vaginal diseases and suggesting its potential for 
HPV clearance. Understanding the role of probiotics in the gut-vagina axis could 
pave the way for new strategies to reduce and eliminate HPV and related 
diseases.

The identification of new functional food constituents is a priority to improve 
the prognosis and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, several 
bacterial and algal phytoene-enriched extracts were obtained, and their 
potential activity against oxidative damage and their ability to inhibit 
proliferation and cell migration in several human colon-adenocarcinoma-derived 
cell lines were assessed. The main conclusions indicate that total extracts of 
Sphingomonas echinoides and Chlorella sorokiniana exhibited the highest 
protective effect against oxidative damage. All extracts enhanced the activity 
of detoxifying enzymes, particularly importantly the increase of NAD(P)H:quinone 
oxidoreductase activity, which reached a value 40% higher than that of untreated 
control cells upon exposure to Escherichia coli extracts. Staphylococcus 
haemolyticus and transgenic E. coli extracts significantly arrested the 
migration capacity of both cell lines, while S. haemolyticus and C. sorokiniana 
extracts inhibited cell proliferation by 15 to 20% compared to untreated cells. 
These results point to these extracts as potential antioxidant complements able 
to protect cells against oxidative damage and with a moderate ability to inhibit 
the proliferation and migration of CRC tumor cells, paving the way to design 
functional foods or probiotic formulations with preventive properties against 
oxidative stress-related diseases, such as cancer, or as starting point for 
purifying anticancer compounds.

Constipation is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal system 
characterized by difficult bowel movements, infrequent defecation, reduced water 
content, and hard stools. This study aims to evaluate the preventive effects of 
fermented gold kiwis (FGK) on loperamide-induced constipation in rats and 
investigate its efficacy in improving constipation symptoms in human patients 
through a randomized clinical trial. In the animal study, FGK was administered 
orally at doses of 50, 125, and 250 mg/kg to constipated rats for two weeks, 
resulting in significant improvements in constipation parameters. FGK increased 
serum serotonin and acetylcholine levels and suppressed increases in serum 
dopamine concentration. FGK also upregulated mRNA expression of the 
serotonin-synthesizing receptors 5-HT3R and 5-HT4R and suppressed the expression 
of the dopamine 2-receptor (D2R) in the duodenum. Furthermore, FGK inhibited 
inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin 
(IL)-1β, and IL-6. In the clinical trials, the improvement in constipation 
symptoms was evaluated using the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). 
Clinical trial participants reported significant improvements in constipation 
symptoms after receiving FGK. These findings suggest that FGK effectively 
relieves constipation in both animals and humans, indicating its potential as an 
effective dietary supplement.

Background: This review investigates the impact of bioactive molecules produced 
by probiotics on child health, focusing on their roles in modulating gut 
microbiota, enhancing immune function, and supporting overall development. Key 
metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bacteriocins, 
exopolysaccharides (EPSs), vitamins, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are 
highlighted for their ability to maintain gut health, regulate inflammation, and 
support neurodevelopment. Objectives: The aim of this review is to examine the 
mechanisms of action and clinical evidence supporting the use of probiotics and 
postbiotics in pediatric healthcare, with a focus on promoting optimal growth, 
development, and overall health in children. Methods: The review synthesizes 
findings from clinical studies that investigate the effects of probiotics and 
their metabolites on pediatric health. The focus is on specific probiotics and 
their ability to influence gut health, immune responses, and developmental 
outcomes. Results: Clinical studies demonstrate that specific probiotics and 
their metabolites can reduce gastrointestinal disorders, enhance immune 
responses, and decrease the incidence of allergies and respiratory infections in 
pediatric populations. Additionally, postbiotics-bioactive compounds from 
probiotic fermentation-offer promising benefits, such as improved gut barrier 
function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced nutrient absorption, while 
presenting fewer safety concerns compared to live probiotics. Conclusions: By 
examining the mechanisms of action and clinical evidence, this review 
underscores the potential of integrating probiotics and postbiotics into 
pediatric healthcare strategies to promote optimal growth, development, and 
overall health in children.

BACKGROUND: Preterm infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU) have a risk of severe viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs). 
Researchers have recently reported the potential use of postbiotics to decrease 
RTIs in young children. However, the safety and efficacy of postbiotics for 
preventing RTIs in preterm infants is not yet established.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 
of the heat-killed lactic acid bacterium Pediococcus acidilactici K15 in 41 
preterm infants born at <36 weeks of gestation and discharged from the NICU at 
Chiba University Hospital.
RESULTS: Following once-daily K15 or placebo treatment for one year, no 
significant differences were found in the mean number of febrile days (4.5 
[1.5-7.4] days vs. 6.6 [2.6-10.5] days). The subgroup analysis showed that the 
effect of treatment on the number of febrile days was more prominent in the K15 
group than in the placebo group, among children with older siblings. The 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples illustrated that the genus Faecalimonas 
was enriched in the K15 group, potentially promoting butyrate production by 
butyrate-producing bacteria. No adverse events were found to be associated with 
K15 intake.
CONCLUSION: There were no clear data to show the effectiveness of K15 in 
preventing fever and RTIs in preterm babies during infancy. A larger clinical 
trial is warranted.

Background/Objectives: Impaired cognition is a key trait of the diseases of 
aging and is an important quality of life factor for older adults and their 
families. Over the past decade, there has been an increasing appreciation for 
the role of the microbiome in cognition, as well as emerging evidence that 
probiotics, such as those in yogurt and other dairy products, can have a 
positive impact on cognitive function. However, it is unclear to what extent the 
consumption of yogurt is associated with improved cognitive function in older 
adults. Methods: Therefore, we compared the scores for the Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scale, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test between respondents who 
self-reported daily yogurt/dairy consumption with those who claimed they did not 
in an NHANES. Results: We found that cognitive scores were significantly higher 
(40.03 ± 0.64 vs. 36.28 ± 1.26, p = 0.017) in respondents reporting daily 
yogurt/dairy consumption, though only a trend remained after adjusting for 
sociodemographic covariates (p = 0.074). Conclusions: Further studies are 
required to confirm that this is a cause-effect relationship and whether 
changing diets is a low-cost means of protecting aging populations from 
cognitive decline and improving their quality of life.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is one of the pathogens involved in 
gingival inflammation, which may trigger neuroinflammatory diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the protective 
(preventive and treatment) effects of a lactobacilli mixture combining 
Lactobacillus reuteri PTCC1655, Lactobacillus brevis CD0817, Lacticaseibacillus 
rhamnosus PTCC1637, and Lactobacillus plantarum PTCC1058 against P. 
gingivalis-induced gingival inflammation and AD-like pathology in rats. These 
probiotic strains exhibited cognitive enhancement effects, but this study 
proposed to assess their activity in a mixture. To propose a probable mechanism 
for P. gingivalis cognitive impairments, the TEs balance were analyzed in 
hippocampus and cortex tissues. Animals were divided into five groups: the 
control, lactobacilli, P. gingivalis, lactobacilli + P. gingivalis (prevention), 
and P. gingivalis + lactobacilli group (treatment) groups. The behavioral and 
histopathological changes were compared among them. Finally, The Trace elements 
(TEs) levels in the hippocampus and cortex tissues were analyzed. The palatal 
tissue sections of the P. gingivalis infected rats showed moderate inflammation 
with dense infiltration of inflammatory cells, a limited area of tissue edema, 
and vascular congestion. Additionally, passive avoidance learning and spatial 
memory were impaired. Histopathological tests revealed the presence of 
Aβ-positive cells in the P. gingivalis group. While the Aβ-positive cells 
decreased in the treatment group, their formation was inhibited in the 
preventive group. Administration of a mixture of lactobacilli (orally) 
effectively mitigated the gingival inflammation, Aβ production, and improved 
learning and memory functions. Moreover, Zn, Cu, and Mn levels in the 
hippocampus were dramatically elevated by P. gingivalis infection, whereas 
lactobacilli mixture mitigated these disruptive effects. The lactobacilli 
mixture significantly prevented the disruptive effects of P. gingivalis on 
gingival and brain tissues in rats. Therefore, new formulated combination of 
lactobacilli may be a good candidate for inhibiting the P. gingivalis infection 
and its subsequent cognitive effects. The current study aimed to evaluate the 
effects of a lactobacilli mixture to manage the disruptive effects of P. 
gingivalis infection on memory.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a condition characterized by inflammation and ulcer 
formation in the colon and rectum due to genetic and environmental factors. It 
is a common condition, with a global prevalence rate exceeding 0.3%. Current 
treatments have limited efficacy and can cause unwanted side effects, leading to 
a high recurrence rate and reduced quality of life for patients. This study 
suggests that Bacillus clausii has a beneficial role in reducing intestinal 
inflammation and relieving colitis symptoms in mice. The study aimed to examine 
B. clausii's potential to reduce the progression and pathogenesis of dextran 
sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced UC. Bacillus clausii was administered to mice as a 
pre-treatment, post-treatment and adjunct treatment with sulfasalazine for 
14 days. The study found that B. clausii effectively reduced the severity of 
colitis in mice when used preventatively. Administering B. clausii after the 
onset of colitis also effectively alleviated symptoms. Combining B. clausii with 
standard sulfasalazine as adjunct therapy was more effective in reducing 
intestinal inflammation than using a single therapy alone. B. clausii has shown 
the potential to prevent colon damage and decrease the likelihood and severity 
of the disease. Immunohistochemistry results revealed a decrease in the 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α and NFkB in colon 
tissue. Additionally, mice that received B. clausii showed a significant 
increase in anti-oxidant levels and improved haematological markers. In 
conclusion, it must be emphasized that B. clausii possesses the potential to 
alleviate the symptoms of UC.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-inflammatory disease. Gut 
microbes, intestinal immunity, and gut barrier function play a critical role in 
IBD. Growing evidence suggests that synbiotic may offer therapeutic benefits for 
individuals with colitis, suggesting an alternative therapy against colitis. 
With this in mind, we creatively prepared a new synbiotic combination consisting 
of a probiotic strain (Limosilactobacillus reuteri) along with one prebiotic 
chitooligosaccharides (COS). The protective effects of the synbiotic on 
DSS-induced colitis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. We 
demonstrated that the synbiotic ameliorated colitis in mice, as evidenced by a 
significant remission in body weight loss and colon shortening, and a decreased 
disease activity index (DAI). Notably, synbiotic reduced the intestinal 
inflammation and injury by synergistically decreasing inflammatory factors, 
inhibiting TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling, preventing macrophage infiltration, 
and enhancing the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Moreover, synbiotic 
selectively promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia, 
Lactobacillus) but decreased the pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter). 
BugBase's analysis supported its ameliorated role in reducing pathogenic 
bacteria. Collectively, our findings revealed the novel synbiotic had a 
potential to treat colitis, which was associated with its anti-inflammatory and 
microbiota-balancing properties. This study will contribute to the development 
of functional synbiotic products for IBD therapy and will provide valuable 
insights into their mechanisms.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is diarrhea caused by disturbances in 
intestinal microbiota and metabolism following inappropriate use of antibiotics. 
With the over-reliance on antibiotics, the incidence of AAD is increasing 
worldwide. Recently, the role of probiotics and prebiotic preparations in the 
prevention and treatment of AAD has received increasing attention. Various 
prebiotics can not only reduce the incidence of AAD, but also effectively 
shorten the course of the disease and alleviate the symptoms. Notably, many 
polysaccharides derived from plants and fungi are a class of biologically active 
and rich prebiotics with great potential to alleviate AAD. Therefore, this 
review aims to summarize the latest research on natural product polysaccharides 
to alleviate antibiotic-associated diarrhea by modulating the gut microbiota. It 
provides a theoretical basis for exploring the mechanism of natural product 
modulation of gut microbiota to alleviate AAD, and provides a reference for 
further development of active prebiotics.

The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia (HUA) and 
gout. However, it remains unclear whether probiotics residing in the host gut, 
such as Lactobacillus, can prevent HUA development. Herein, we isolated 
Lactobacillus plantarum SQ001 from the cecum of HUA geese and conducted in vitro 
assays on uric acid (UA) and nucleoside co-culture. Metabolomics and genome-wide 
analyses, revealed that this strain may promote nucleoside uptake and hydrolysis 
through its nucleoside hydrolase gene. The functional role of iunH gene was 
confirmed via heterologous expression and gene knockout studies. Oral 
administration of L. plantarum SQ001 resulted in increased abundance of 
Lactobacillus species and reduced serum UA levels. Furthermore, it downregulated 
hepatic xanthine oxidase, a key enzyme involved in UA synthesis, as well as 
renal reabsorption protein GLUT9, while enhancing the expression of renal 
excretion protein ABCG2. Our findings suggest that L. plantarum has potential to 
ameliorate gut microbial dysbiosis with HUA, thereby offering insights into its 
potential application as a probiotic therapy for individuals with HUA or gout.

Plain Language Summary: Our blood contains many components, including waste 
products that need to be transported to the kidneys, where they can exit the 
body through urine. One such molecule, known as uric acid, forms when cells 
break down old DNA and other similar molecules. This process has several steps, 
with DNA being broken down into intermediate molecules called nucleosides before 
being converted into uric acid. If the amount of uric acid in the bloodstream 
becomes too high (a condition known as hyperuricemia), humans and other animals 
can develop high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and other illnesses. 
Recent studies suggest that some types of ‘friendly’ bacteria living in the 
human gut may influence how uric acid levels are regulated. But the precise role 
these bacteria play remains unclear. Here, Fu, Luo et al. isolated one of these 
friendly bacterial species, known as Lactobacillus plantarum, from the gut of 
geese with hyperuricemia. The team grew the bacteria in the laboratory in two 
environments: one containing uric acid and the other containing nucleosides. The 
experiments revealed that while Lactobacillus plantarum does not directly act on 
uric acid, it does have enzymes that can convert nucleosides into other 
molecules. Further investigations, using whole-genome and metabolomic analyses, 
showed that Lactobacillus plantarum contains three genes encoding enzymes that 
act on a type of nucleoside known as a purine. Knocking out one of these genes 
prevented the bacteria from being able to convert purines into other molecules. 
Subsequently, Fu, Luo et al. demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum helps to 
mitigate the effects of hyperuricemia in geese and mice. These findings provide 
valuable insights into how microbes living in the gut regulate uric acid levels 
in their hosts. They may also inform future strategies for preventing and 
treating hyperuricemia in humans.

Many studies have highlighted the role of probiotics in re-establishing the gut 
microbiota balance and preventing intestinal barrier dysfunction. In fact, they 
can also contribute to the upregulation of anti-inflammatory genes and the 
downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, which are known to contribute to the 
development of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) syndrome. The present study 
aims to investigate the effect of the compatible solute hydroxyectoine (HOE), to 
be used as a cryopreservant but also for its intrinsic biological properties, to 
obtain a new formula containing three probiotic strains (Limosilactobacillus 
fermentum (L. fermentum), Levilactobacillus brevis SP-48 (L. brevis), and 
Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (B. lactis)), and evaluate the latter for its 
ability to prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in an in vitro 
bi-dimensional model of the intestinal barrier using a Caco-2 cell monolayer. 
The mRNA expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and 
TNF-α) were analyzed by real-time PCR. Changes in the modulation of (TLR-4 and 
NF-κB) proteins were assessed by western blotting, and the effect of the HOE/PRO 
formula on the intestinal epithelial barrier function was also assessed using an 
immunofluorescence microscope for the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 
(ZO-1). This study found that this novel probiotic formulation containing HOE is 
capable of decreasing LPS-induced cytokines, as confirmed by the results of 
RT-PCR and ELISA and preserving the integrity of tight junctions as demonstrated 
by the relevant expression of ZO-1. HOE/PRO was shown to be effective in 
reducing the expression of TLR-4 and NF-κB. The latter plays a key role as an 
inflammation modulator as shown through experiments run with the THP-1/NF-κB 
reporter gene. Collectively, our data indicate that the HOE/PRO formula is a 
good candidate for potential preventive and/or therapeutic implementation in 
IBD.

BACKGROUND: Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains produce neonatal septicemia 
after colonizing the neonatal gut. While the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus 
GG (LGG) effectively reduces neonatal sepsis, LGG's effects on the neonatal 
intestinal microbiota alterations and inflammation triggered by E. coli are 
incompletely understood. We hypothesized that LGG significantly modulates the 
specific neonatal gut microbial populations changes and the inflammatory 
response elicited by the enteral introduction of septicemia-producing E. coli. 
To test this hypothesis, newborn rats were pretreated orally with LGG or placebo 
prior to infection with the neonatal E. coli septicemia clinical isolate SCB34. 
Amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on intestinal samples. 
Intestinal injury and expression of inflammatory mediators and apoptosis were 
determined.
RESULTS: Alpha diversity of gut microbiota was greater in SCB34-infected pups in 
comparison to sham-infected pups, these changes were not modified by LGG 
pretreatment. Beta diversity analyses also showed differences between 
SCB34-infected vs. uninfected pups. LGG pretreatment before SCB34 infection did 
not result in significant beta diversity changes compared to placebo. Moreover, 
individual genera and species abundance analyses by linear discriminant analysis 
effect size (LEfSe) showed significant changes in Gram-negative, Gram-positive, 
and anaerobic populations resulting from LGG pretreatment and SCB34 infection. 
LGG significantly suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines but did 
not attenuate SCB34-induced apoptosis or histologic injury.
CONCLUSIONS: LGG modulates clinically significant microbiota features and 
inflammation triggered by pathogenic E. coli intestinal infection shortly after 
birth. This new knowledge can potentially be harnessed to design novel 
interventions against gut-derived neonatal sepsis.

The human gut harbors a complex and diverse microbiota essential for maintaining 
health. Diet is the most significant modifiable factor influencing gut 
microbiota composition and function, particularly through bioactive compounds 
like polyphenols, dietary fibers, and carotenoids found in vegetables, fruits, 
seafood, coffee, and green tea. These compounds regulate the gut microbiota by 
promoting beneficial bacteria and suppressing harmful ones, leading to the 
production of key microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty 
acids, bile acid derivatives, and tryptophan metabolites. These metabolites are 
crucial for gut homeostasis, influencing gut barrier function, immune responses, 
energy metabolism, anti-inflammatory processes, lipid digestion, and modulation 
of gut inflammation. This review outlines the regulatory impact of typical 
bioactive compounds on the gut microbiota and explores the connection between 
specific microbiota-derived metabolites and overall health. We discuss how 
dietary interventions can affect disease development and progression through 
mechanisms involving these metabolites. We examine the roles of bioactive 
compounds and their metabolites in the prevention and treatment of diseases 
including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study provides new 
insights into disease prevention and underscores the potential of dietary 
modulation of the gut microbiota as a strategy for improving health.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infects approximately half of the population 
worldwide and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. 
Test-and-treat strategies have been recommended for the prevention of H. 
pylori-associated diseases. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing 
technologies have broadened our understanding of the complex gastrointestinal 
(GI) microbiota and its role in maintaining host homeostasis. Recently, an 
increasing number of studies have indicated that the colonization of H. pylori 
induces dramatic alterations in the gastric microbiota, with a predominance of 
H. pylori and a reduction in microbial diversity. Dysbiosis of the gut 
microbiome has also been observed after H. pylori infection, which may play a 
role in the development of colorectal cancer. However, there is concern 
regarding the impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota during H. pylori 
eradication. In this review, we summarize the current literature concerning how 
H. pylori infection reshapes the GI microbiota and the underlying mechanisms, 
including changes in the gastric environment, immune responses, and persistent 
inflammation. Additionally, the impacts of H. pylori eradication on GI microbial 
homeostasis and the use of probiotics as adjuvant therapy are also discussed. 
The shifts in the GI microbiota and their crosstalk with H. pylori may provide 
potential targets for H. pylori-related gastric diseases and extragastric 
manifestations.

Colorectal cancer is the most common type of cancer in the digestive system and 
poses a major threat to human health. The gut microbiota has been found to be a 
key factor influencing the development of colorectal cancer. Extracellular 
vesicles are important mediators of intercellular communication. Not only do 
they regulate life activities within the same individual, but they have also 
been found in recent years to be important mediators of communication between 
different species, such as the gut microbiota and the host. Their preventive, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic value in colorectal cancer is being explored. The 
aim of this review is to provide insights into the complex interactions between 
host and gut microbiota, particularly those mediated through extracellular 
vesicles, and how these interactions affect colorectal cancer development. In 
addition, the potential of extracellular vesicles from various body fluids as 
biomarkers was evaluated. Finally, we discuss the potential, challenges, and 
future research directions of extracellular vesicles in their application to 
colorectal cancer. Overall, extracellular vesicles have great potential for 
application in medical processes related to colorectal cancer, but their 
isolation and characterization techniques, intercellular communication 
mechanisms, and the effectiveness of their clinical application require further 
research and exploration.

Historically, Xanthomonas species are primarily known for their pathogenicity 
against plants, but recently, there have been more findings of non-pathogenic 
xanthomonads. In the present study, we report isolates from healthy rice seeds 
that belong to a new species, Xanthomonas protegens, a protector of the rice 
plants against a serious pathogenic counterpart, i.e. X. oryzae pv. oryzae upon 
leaf clip co-inoculation. The new member species is non-pathogenic to rice and 
lacks a type III secretion system. The pangenome investigation revealed a large 
number of unique genes, including a novel lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene 
cluster, that might be important in its adaptation. The phylo-taxonogenomic 
analysis revealed that X. protegens is a taxonomic outlier species of X. sontii, 
a core, vertically transmitted rice seed endophyte with numerous probiotic 
properties. Interestingly, X. sontii is also reported as a keystone species of 
healthy rice seed microbiome. The findings and resources will help in the 
development of unique gene markers and evolutionary studies of X. sontii as a 
successful symbiont and X. oryzae as a serious pathogen. Here, we propose X. 
protegens sp. nov. as a novel species of the genus Xanthomonas with 
PPL118 = MTCC 13396 = CFBP 9164 = ICMP 25181 as the type strain. PPL117, PPL124, 
PPL125, and PPL126 are other strains of the species.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly 
reported infections in Belgian nursing home residents. In older adults, UTI 
diagnosis and management is complex, often leading to over-diagnosis and 
irrational antimicrobial use, stressing the need for a guideline approach.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A consensus statement on the prevention, diagnosis and 
treatment of UTIs in older adults residing in nursing homes was developed in a 
collaborative effort between the Flemish Hospital Outbreak Support Teams, the 
Flemish Agency for Care and Health, the Association of the Flemish Coordinating 
and Advising General Practitioners, the Belgian Association of Urology, the 
Belgian Society for Gerontology and Geriatrics and PhD researchers based on a 
combination of clinical expertise, (inter)national guidelines and peer-reviewed 
studies.
RESULTS: Optimizing fluid intake, appropriate toilet behaviour and posture, 
mobilization and local estrogen therapy in women are of proven value in UTI 
prevention, whereas the use of cranberry and probiotics is not to be advocated. 
The importance of avoiding bladder catheterization is stressed. In older nursing 
home residents, the diagnosis of UTIs remains challenging, mostly due to 
atypical systemic symptoms. A consensus diagnostic algorithm for UTI among 
residents with and without a urinary catheter was developed, including the 
presence of suggestive clinical symptoms and a positive urine culture. Urine 
dipsticks have a high negative but a low positive predictive value. C-reactive 
protein point-of-care testing is not recommended. Asymptomatic bacteriuria 
should not be screened for, in order to avoid unnecessary triggers for 
treatment. In cystitis, nitrofurantoin is the primary choice for treatment, with 
fosfomycin as an alternative; in prostatitis and uncomplicated pyelonephritis a 
fluoroquinolone is the advocated empirical antimicrobial.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide despite advances in medical research and therapeutics. 
Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of the gut-brain axis, a complex 
communication network involving the gut microbiota, central nervous system, and 
cardiovascular system, in modulating cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota 
influences systemic inflammation, neurohumoral pathways, and metabolic 
processes, which are critical in the pathogenesis of CVD. Dysbiosis, or an 
imbalance in the gut microbiota, has been implicated in various cardiovascular 
conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. This 
comprehensive review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between the 
gut microbiome, brain, and cardiovascular system, highlighting the mechanisms by 
which gut-derived signals affect cardiovascular function. Key microbial 
metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-oxide 
(TMAO), and their impact on vascular health and blood pressure regulation are 
discussed. Furthermore, the review explores potential therapeutic strategies 
targeting the gut-brain axis, including probiotics, prebiotics, dietary 
modifications, and pharmacological interventions, to improve cardiovascular 
outcomes. Despite promising findings, the field faces challenges such as 
individual variability in microbiome composition, complexities in gut-brain 
interactions, and the need for robust clinical trials to establish causality. 
Addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary research could pave the 
way for innovative, personalized therapeutic approaches. This review provides a 
comprehensive understanding of the gut-brain-cardiovascular axis, underscoring 
its potential as a novel target for preventing and treating CVD.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a prevalent complication of 
antibiotic therapy, attributed to disruptions in gut microbiota. Probiotics are 
increasingly studied for their potential in preventing AAD by restoring 
microbial balance.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to assess the efficacy of 
probiotics in reducing AAD in adult patients when compared to a placebo.
METHODOLOGY: This research was conducted from March 2023 to March 2024 using a 
randomized, placebo-controlled design at multiple institutions: Khyber Teaching 
Hospital, Peshawar; Prime Teaching Hospital, Peshawar; Mufti Mahmood Memorial 
Teaching Hospital, Dera Ismail Khan; Shalamar Hospital, Lahore; University 
Hospitals of Leicester; and DHQ Teaching Hospital Kohat, enrolling 340 adult 
patients prescribed systemic antibiotics. Eligible participants were aged 18 
years and older, while those with chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, 
immunodeficiency, recent probiotic or antibiotic use, or inability to provide 
informed consent were excluded. The sample size was calculated using WHO 
guidelines, resulting in a target of 340 to ensure adequate power. Participants 
were randomized to receive either probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and 
Bifidobacterium longum BB536) or placebo, administered within 24 hours of 
starting antibiotics. Daily monitoring of bowel habits and symptoms was 
performed using standardized diaries, and adherence was evaluated through pill 
counts. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 27 (Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), 
comparing the incidence, severity, and duration of AAD between groups, with a 
significance threshold of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: In the probiotic group, 31 patients (18.23%) developed AAD compared to 
53 patients (31.17%) in the placebo group (p=0.01). Among those with AAD, the 
probiotic group experienced a shorter duration (mean 3.5 ± 1.2 days) compared to 
placebo (mean 5.1 ± 1.8 days, p=0.002). Adherence rates were high in both groups 
(probiotic: 96.4%, placebo: 95.9%). Significant improvements in bowel habits 
were reported more frequently in the probiotic group (77.06%) than placebo 
(50.59%, p=0.02). The hospital stay duration was similar between groups 
(probiotic: mean 7.8 ± 2.1 days, placebo: mean 8.3 ± 2.4 days, p=0.15).
CONCLUSION: Probiotics significantly reduced the incidence and duration of AAD 
compared to placebo, with high adherence and favorable patient-reported 
outcomes.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Prevention, management or cure of diseases through dietary 
approaches is becoming increasingly important. Research suggests that probiotic, 
oxalate-degrading Lactobacillus species administered via a milk and cereal food 
can prevent kidney stones while also addressing nutritional deficiencies and 
maintaining essential calcium levels. This study investigates the effect of a 
composite probiotic milk beverage on urolithiatic rats.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Probiotic milk-barley beverage (PMBB) was prepared by 
fermentation of milk enriched with barley (Hordeum vulgare) flour using starter 
culture containing oxalate-degrading probiotic strains (Lacticaseibacillus 
rhamnosus strains MTCC5945 and MTCC25062, Lactobacillus helveticus MTCC5463 and 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum M11). Cumin and common salt were used as 
flavourings. Unfermented milk-barley base (C) served as control. Wistar rats 
were divided in four groups (N=6). Normal control (NC) group received normal rat 
diet, and to induce kidney stones, ethylene glycol (0.75 %) and ammonium 
chloride (1 %) were administered to the disease control (DC) group, PMBB and 
control (C) groups for 28 days. PMBB and C groups received 1 mL of probiotic 
milk and barley beverage and unfermented milk-barley base from day 15 to day 28. 
Indicators of urolithiasis were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PMBB significantly (p<0.05) increased urine output, 
decreased urine oxalate concentrations and increased creatinine, calcium and 
uric acid concentrations. Serum parameters such as concentrations of calcium, 
uric acid, urea and creatinine increased significantly (p<0.05) in DC rats, but 
decreased significantly (p<0.05) in the PMBB group. In addition, serum 
concentrations of magnesium and osteopontin decreased more significantly in DC 
rats than in the PMBB ones. The increase in malondialdehyde and decrease in 
reduced glutathione concentrations observed in the DC group were significantly 
lower in the PMBB group. The histomorphology of the kidney tissue of DC rats 
showed calcium oxalate crystal aggregates in the tubules, indicators of renal 
injury, tubular dilatation, enlarged urinary space and shrunken glomeruli. The 
PMBB group showed an improvement in the renal histological architecture. 
Analysis of the caecal digesta of the rats showed a significantly (p<0.05) 
higher mass fraction of fatty acids (acetic and propionic) in the treatment 
group. The results show the potential of PMBB in the dietary control of 
urolithiasis.
NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This study focuses on the antiurolithiatic 
prospect of a composite probiotic milk beverage produced with oxalate-degrading 
culture. It also points to a new functional food form that shows promising 
health benefits in nutrition of patients with urolithiasis.

Dental caries, a prevalent oral infectious disease, is intricately linked to the 
biofilm formation on the tooth surfaces by oral microbes. Among these, 
Streptococcus mutans plays a central role in the initiation and progression of 
caries due to its ability to produce glucosyltransferases, synthesize 
extracellular polysaccharides, and facilitate bacterial adhesion and 
aggregation. This leads to the formation of biofilms where the bacteria 
metabolize dietary carbohydrates to produce acids. Therefore, devising effective 
strategies to inhibit S. mutans biofilm formation is crucial for dental caries 
prevention and oral health promotion. Though preventive measures like mechanical 
removal and antibacterial drugs (fluoride, chlorhexidine) exist, they pose 
challenges such as time consumption, short-term effectiveness, antibiotic 
resistance, and disruption of oral flora balance. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of emerging strategies such as antimicrobial peptides, 
probiotics, nanoparticles, and non-thermal plasma therapies for targeted 
inhibition of S. mutans biofilm formation. Moreover, current research insights 
into the regulatory mechanisms governing S. mutans biofilm formation are also 
elucidated. The objective is to foster the development of innovative, efficient 
and safe techniques for caries prevention and treatment, thereby expanding 
treatment options in clinical dentistry and promoting oral health.

Recent years have witnessed major advances and an ever-growing list of 
healthcare applications for microbiome-based therapeutics. However, these 
advances have disproportionately targeted diseases common in high-income 
countries (HICs). Within low- to middle-income countries (LMIC), opportunities 
for microbiome-based therapeutics include sexual health epidemics, maternal 
health, early life mortality, malnutrition, vaccine response and infectious 
diseases. In this review we detail the advances that have been achieved in 
microbiome-based therapeutics for these areas of healthcare and identify where 
further work is required. Current efforts to characterise microbiomes from LMICs 
will aid in targeting and optimisation of therapeutics and preventative 
strategies specifically suited to the unmet needs within these populations. Once 
achieved, opportunities from disease treatment and improved treatment efficacy 
through to disease prevention and vector control can be effectively addressed 
using probiotics and live biotherapeutics. Together these strategies have the 
potential to increase individual health, overcome logistical challenges and 
reduce overall medical, individual, societal and economic costs.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is defined as an autoimmune metabolic disorder, 
characterized by destruction of pancreatic β-cells and high blood sugar levels. 
If left untreated, T1D results in severe health complications, including 
cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as nerve damage, with ultimately 
grave consequences. Besides the role of genetic and certain environmental 
factors in T1D development, in the last decade, one new player emerged to affect 
T1D pathology as well, and that is a gut microbiota. Dysbiosis of gut bacteria 
can contribute to T1D by gut barrier disruption and the activation of autoimmune 
response, leading to the destruction of insulin producing cells, causing the 
development and aggravation of T1D symptoms. The relationship between gut 
microbiota and diabetes is complex and varies between individuals and additional 
research is needed to fully understand the effects of gut microbiome 
alternations in T1D pathogenesis. Therefore, the goal of this review is to 
understand the current knowledge in underlying molecular mechanism of gut 
microbiota effects, which leads to the new approaches for further studies in the 
prevention and treatment of T1D.

Probiotics and live therapeutic bacteria (LTB), their strictly regulated 
therapeutic counterpart, are increasingly important in treating and preventing 
biofilm-related diseases. This necessitates new approaches to (i) preserve 
bacterial viability during manufacturing and storage and (ii) incorporate LTB 
into delivery systems for enhanced therapeutic efficacy. This review explores 
advances in probiotic and LTB product development, focusing on preservation, 
protection, and improved delivery. Preservation of bacteria can be achieved by 
drying methods that decelerate metabolism. These methods introduce stresses 
affecting viability which can be mitigated with suitable excipients like 
polymeric or low molecular weight stabilizers. The review emphasizes the 
incorporation of LTB into polymer-based nanofibers via electrospinning, enabling 
simultaneous drying, encapsulation, and delivery system production. Optimization 
of bacterial survival during electrospinning and storage is discussed, as well 
as controlled LTB release achievable through formulation design using 
gel-forming, gastroprotective, mucoadhesive, and pH-responsive polymers. 
Evaluation of the presence of the actual therapeutic strains, bacterial 
viability and activity by CFU enumeration or alternative analytical techniques 
is presented as a key aspect of developing effective and safe formulations with 
LTB. This review offers insights into designing delivery systems, especially 
polymeric nanofibers, for preservation and delivery of LTB, guiding readers in 
developing innovative biotherapeutic delivery systems.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranks among the world's three 
leading causes of mortality, owing to the increased smokers and aging 
populations. Previous studies showed that gut microbiota could help to 
ameliorate respiratory diseases. Hence, the current study aims to evaluate the 
effects of probiotics, prebiotics, or yogurt on the prevalence of COPD. A 
cross-sectional study was carried out by investigating data from three 
consecutive NHANES cycles during 2007-2012. Individuals who met the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were studied. Prescription medications and dietary were 
reviewed to identify the intake of probiotics, prebiotics, or yogurt. The 
included participants were then divided into two groups depending on their 
consumption of probiotics, prebiotics, or yogurt. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of probiotics, 
prebiotics, or yogurt consumption on the prevalence of COPD. Out of 7486 
enrolled participants, 1656 (22.12%) were categorized into the probiotics, 
prebiotics, or yogurt intake group. This study indicated that consuming 
probiotics, prebiotics, or yogurt were correlated with a lower incidence of 
COPD, even when factors like gender, age, education, moderate-intensity 
activities, vigorous activities, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, smoking and 
alcohol consumption were accounted for (Model 1: OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; 
Model 2: OR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.59-0.99; Model 3: OR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.57-0.98). The 
findings reveal that consuming probiotics, prebiotics, or yogurt might play a 
beneficial role in preventing COPD.

Acute liver failure (ALF), associated with a clinical fatality rate exceeding 
80%, is characterized by severe liver damage resulting from various factors in 
the absence of pre-existing liver disease. The role of microbiota in the 
progression of diverse liver diseases, including ALF, has been increasingly 
recognized, with the interactions between the microbiota and the host 
significantly influencing both disease onset and progression. Despite growing 
interest in the microbiological aspects of ALF, comprehensive reviews remain 
limited. This review critically examines the mechanisms and efficacy of 
microbiota-based treatments for ALF, focusing on their role in prevention, 
treatment, and prognosis over the past decade.

INTRODUCTION: Probiotics are living micro-organisms that are likely to influence 
oral health by modulating the oral microbiota and offer a promising preventive 
approach to gum and dental disease. This approach is particularly relevant for 
orthodontic patients, who are more susceptible to gingival inflammation and 
plaque accumulation. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare 
the effects of a probiotic toothpaste versus a regular toothpaste on gingival 
health and plaque levels in orthodontic patients.
METHODS: Participants were recruited between 4 June 2024 and 15 July 2024, and 
were aged between 18 and 50years. They did not suffer from mental/physical 
disabilities, craniofacial disorders, enamel/tooth dysplasia and were not taking 
medication affecting plaque build-up. Participants were randomized in two groups 
using a computer programme and sealed envelopes: the group A (control) used an 
ordinary toothpaste (Colgate) twice a day for four weeks, the group B used a 
probiotic toothpaste containing Lactobacillus paracasei twice a day for four 
weeks. Standard oral hygiene instructions were given to all participants. The 
primary outcome was the mean change in gingival bleeding index (GBI) and plaque 
index (PI) over four weeks. This was an open-label trial. Only the evaluator was 
blinded and the evaluation criteria were objective.
RESULTS: Forty-four participants, 22 in each group, were finally included and 
analysed. After the intervention, the probiotic group had a significantly lower 
median gingival score [0.12 (IQR 0.09, 0.16)] than the control group [0.15 (IQR 
0.10, 0.18)], with a p-value of 0.041 (95% CI: 0.009-0.18). However, there was 
no significant difference in plaque scores between the two groups [Probiotic: 
20.0 (IQR 18.0, 21.0) vs. control: 21.0 (IQR 19.0, 22.0), P=0.15]. No 
significant adverse events or side effects were reported.
CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this trial, the probiotic toothpaste only 
significantly improved the gingival bleeding index in orthodontic patients 
compared to regular toothpaste.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. 
However, its clinical treatment is limited. Currently, the treatment of lung 
diseases by regulating the lung microbiota has become a research hotspot. In 
this study, we investigated the protective effects of the intranasal 
administration of Clostridium butyricum and its derived extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. The results demonstrated 
that compared with the LPS group, the pre-treatment group with C. butyricum and 
its EVs reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviated the 
symptoms in ALI mice by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, 
C. butyricum and its derived EVs inhibited the expression of apoptosis-related 
proteins and increased the expression of lung barrier proteins. Additionally, 
the intervention of C. butyricum changed the composition of the pulmonary 
microbiota. At the species level, LPS significantly increased the relative 
abundance of Acinetobacter johnsonii, while C. butyricum reversed this effect. 
In conclusion, these data demonstrate that intranasal administration of C. 
butyricum and its EVs can prevent LPS-induced ALI by reducing inflammation, 
inhibiting apoptosis, and improving lung barrier function. Additionally, C. 
butyricum regulated the pulmonary microbiota of mice to alleviate LPS-induced 
ALI.IMPORTANCEThe disorder of pulmonary microbiota plays an important role in 
the progression of acute lung injury (ALI). However, very few studies have been 
conducted to treat ALI by modulating pulmonary microbiota. In this study, the 
diversity and composition of pulmonary microbiota were altered in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice, but the ecological balance of the 
pulmonary microbiota was restored by intranasal administration of Clostridium 
butyricum. Moreover, the study reported the mechanism of C. butyricum and its 
derived extracellular vesicles for the treatment of LPS-induced ALI. These 
results reveal the importance of pulmonary microbiota in ALI disease. It 
provides a new approach for the treatment of ALI with new-generation probiotics.

BACKGROUND: The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is a central nexus that 
integrates higher cognitive and emotional centers of the central nervous system 
(CNS) within the intricate functioning of the intestine. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that dysbiosis in the taxonomic diversity of gut flora plays a salient 
role in the progression of epilepsy and comorbid secondary complications.
METHODS: In the current study, we investigated the impact of long-term oral 
bacteriotherapy (probiotics; 10 mL/kg; 109 colony-forming unit/ml) as an 
adjunctive treatment intervention with brivaracetam (BRV; 10 mg/kg) over 21 days 
on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced augmented epileptic response and associated 
electrographical and behavioral perturbations in mice. Moreover, we also 
unveiled antioxidant capacity and histopathologic changes in treated versus 
non-treated animals.
RESULTS: Results revealed combination increases seizure threshold and prevented 
high ictal spiking. Additionally, it alleviated PTZ-induced neuropsychiatric 
disturbances such as anxiety and depressive-like phenotype along with cognitive 
deficits. Furthermore, dual therapy prompted physiological oxidant/antioxidant 
balance as evidenced by increased activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and 
catalase) and reduced levels of oxidative stressor (MDA). This therapeutic 
intervention with commensal species suppressed network-driven neuroinflammation 
and preserved normal cytoarchitecture with intact morphology in the pyramidal 
layers of cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3).
CONCLUSION: Our study provides supporting evidence for the use of probiotics as 
adjunctive therapy with anti-seizure medications to modulate epileptogenic 
processes and related multimorbidities, particularly in individuals with 
drug-resistant seizures.

Improvement of strategies to treat heart failure (HF) has been a longstanding 
global goal and challenge. Shen-Fu formula (SF), as a classic herbal 
preparation, has demonstrated efficacy in treating HF in clinical settings. 
However, further understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of SF is required. 
In this study, metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing were used to analyze the 
effects of SF on metabolic profiling and gut microbiota in HF rats. After 
4 weeks of SF treatment, the cardiac function of HF rats showed improvement, 
with a significant increase in ejection fraction and fractional shortening, as 
well as a significant decrease in left ventricular volume and mass. Metabolomics 
study revealed that SF regulates the levels of substances related to energy 
metabolism, primarily involving lysophosphatidylcholines and polyunsaturated 
fatty acids. In addition, we found that SF regulates the structure of the 
microbial community in HF rats and modulates the balance between probiotic and 
pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the SF combination exhibited a superior effect 
that was better than the use of each herb separately. These results demonstrate 
the potential of SF therapy in the management of HF and highlight the role of SF 
in regulating fatty acid metabolism and gut microbiome during HF.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica is a serious threat to human health. It 
causes damage to the intestine and liver. Probiotic therapy has been shown to be 
effective in alleviating intestinal diseases and improving host health. Previous 
studies have found that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens could alleviate the 
pathological symptoms of schistosomiasis japonica, but the regulatory mechanism 
of alleviating schistosomiasis japonica is still unknown.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study analyzed the dynamic changes of intestinal 
microbiome in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum after the intervention of 
B. amyloliquefaciens and its connection to host metabolism by multi-omics 
sequencing technology. B. amyloliquefaciens was found to significantly regulate 
the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota by promoting the growth of beneficial 
bacteria and inhibiting potential pathogenic bacteria and protect the number of 
core microbes. Meanwhile, the genes related to the metabolism of 
glycerophospholipids and amino acid from intestinal microbiome changed 
significantly, and were shown to be significantly positively correlated with the 
associated metabolites of microbial origin. Moreover, host metabolism (lipid 
metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis) was also found to be significantly 
regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: The recovery of intestinal microbial homeostasis and the regulation 
of host metabolism revealed the potential probiotic properties of B. 
amyloliquefaciens, which also provided new ideas for the prevention and adjuvant 
treatment of schistosomiasis japonica.
