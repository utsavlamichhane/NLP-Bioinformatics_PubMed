The sensing of nucleic acids by DEAD/H-box helicases, specifically retinoic 
acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 
(MDA5), plays a critical role in inducing antiviral immunity following 
infection. However, this DEAD/H-box helicase family includes many additional 
proteins whose immune functions have not been investigated. While numerous 
DEAD/H-box helicases contribute to antiviral immunity, they employ diverse 
mechanisms beyond the direct sensing of nucleic acids. Some members have also 
been identified to play proviral (promoting virus replication/propagation) roles 
during infections, regulate other non-viral infections, and contribute to the 
regulation of autoimmunity and cancer. This review synthesizes the known and 
emerging functions of the broader DEAD/H-box helicase family in immune 
regulation and highlights ongoing efforts to target these proteins 
therapeutically.

Throughout gestation, the female body undergoes a series of transformations, 
including profound alterations in intestinal microbial communities. Changes 
gradually increase toward the end of pregnancy and comprise reduced α-diversity 
of microbial communities and an increased propensity for energy harvest. Despite 
the importance of the intestinal microbiota for the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory bowel diseases, very little is known about the relationship between 
these microbiota shifts and pregnancy-associated complications of the disease. 
Here, we explored the longitudinal dynamics of gut microbiota composition and 
functional potential during pregnancy and after lactation in Atg16l1∆IEC mice 
carrying an intestinal epithelial deletion of the Crohn's disease risk gene 
Atg16l1. Using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we 
demonstrated divergent temporal shifts in microbial composition between Atg16l1 
wildtype and Atg16l1∆IEC pregnant mice in trimester 3, which was validated in an 
independent experiment. Observed differences included microbial genera 
implicated in IBD such as Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and 
Turicibacter. Changes partially recovered after lactation. Additionally, 
metagenomic and metabolomic analyses suggest an increased capacity for chitin 
degradation, resulting in higher levels of free N-acetyl-glucosamine products in 
feces, alongside reduced glucose and myo-inositol levels in serum around the 
time of delivery. On the host side, we found that the immunological response of 
Atg16l1∆IEC mice is characterized by higher colonic mRNA levels of TNFα and 
CXCL1 in trimester 3 and a lower weight of offspring at birth. Understanding 
pregnancy-dependent microbiome changes in the context of IBD may constitute the 
first step in the identification of fecal microbial biomarkers and 
microbiota-directed therapies that could help improve precision care for 
managing pregnancies in IBD patients.

Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that is not well understood 
in relation to the microbiome. Our objective was to demonstrate changes in the 
microbiota and the relationships between nutrients in children with celiac 
disease (CD) who followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). A group of 11 children who 
were recently diagnosed with CD, ranging in age from 3 to 12, were monitored for 
a period of 6 months. GFD is designed based on the individual's specific energy 
and nutrient needs, with strict control over dietary adherence. Food 
consumption, blood, and fecal samples were taken. Fecal samples were put through 
16s rRNA sequencing. Microbial modifications were demonstrated using alpha 
diversity, beta diversity, nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NDMS), 
t-test, and metastats. Mean age was 6.4 ± 2.66 years and 54.5% were male 
participants. Serological parameters were negative after 6 months. Both 
unweighted (p = .019) and weighted (p = .021) Unifrac distances were higher 
before GFD, and differences were reliable according to NDMS analysis 
(stress = 0.189). The abundance of Bacteroides ovatus was increased (p = .014), 
whereas unidentified Lachnospiraceae, Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium 
Peptostreptococcus, and Dielma were decreased after GFD (p < .001). Associations 
between nutrients and several genera and species were identified. The presence 
of genus Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium adolescentis was inversely 
associated with fat intake after GFD (p < .01). Microbiota changes became 
evident over a period of 6 months. The presence or absence of small bacteria may 
play a role in the development of CD. Modifying the children's dietary intake 
can potentially influence the microbial composition.

BACKGROUND: Tongxieyaofang (TXYF) was a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
formula for the treatment of diarrhea with liver stagnation and spleen 
deficiency syndrome, but the potential targets and mechanisms have not been 
fully clarified. This study aims to explore the potential mechanisms of TXYF in 
alleviating diarrhea using network pharmacology and full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing.
METHODS: Network pharmacology was applied to identify bioactive compounds and 
potential targets involved in the role of TXYF in alleviating diarrhea. 
Meanwhile, a model of diarrhea with liver stagnation and spleen deficiency 
syndrome was constructed by intragastric administration of Folium senna extract 
combined with restraint and tail pinch stress. The effect of TXYF on intestinal 
mucosal microbiota of diarrhea mice was analyzed by full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis showed that kaempferol, wogonin, 
naringenin, and nobiletin were compounds associated with the efficacy of TXYF. 
TXYF may alleviate diarrhea via multiple BPs and pathways, including TNF 
signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway, which are involved in TCM-gut microbiota-host interactions. Then, we 
found that TXYF administration reshaped the diversity and composition of the 
intestinal mucosal microbial community of diarrhea mice. Lactobacillus, 
primarily Lactobacillus johnsonii, was enriched by the administration of TXYF. 
After TXYF administration, the abundance of Lactobacillus, particularly 
Lactobacillus johnsonii, was enriched.
CONCLUSION: Oral administration of TXYF may alleviate diarrhea through 
remodeling intestinal mucosal microbiota. Promoting the colonization of 
beneficial commensal bacteria in the intestinal mucosa through gut 
microbiota-host interactions may be a potential mechanism of TXYF in the 
treatment of diarrhea.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a transformative approach in 
the diagnosis of infectious diseases, utilizing unbiased high-throughput 
sequencing to directly detect and characterize microbial genomes from clinical 
samples. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental principles, 
sequencing workflow, and platforms utilized in mNGS technology. The 
methodological backbone involves shotgun sequencing of total nucleic acids 
extracted from diverse sample types, enabling simultaneous detection of 
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites without prior knowledge of the 
infectious agent. Key advantages of mNGS include its capability to identify 
rare, novel, or unculturable pathogens, providing a more comprehensive view of 
microbial communities compared to traditional culture-based methods. Despite 
these strengths, challenges such as data analysis complexity, high cost, and the 
need for optimized sample preparation protocols remain significant hurdles. The 
application of mNGS across various systemic infections highlights its clinical 
utility. Case studies discussed in this review illustrate its efficacy in 
diagnosing respiratory tract infections, bloodstream infections, central nervous 
system infections, gastrointestinal infections, and others. By rapidly 
identifying pathogens and their genomic characteristics, mNGS facilitates timely 
and targeted therapeutic interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes and 
infection control measures. Looking ahead, the future of mNGS in infectious 
disease diagnostics appears promising. Advances in bioinformatics tools and 
sequencing technologies are anticipated to streamline data analysis, enhance 
sensitivity and specificity, and reduce turnaround times. Integration with 
clinical decision support systems promises to further optimize mNGS utilization 
in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, mNGS represents a paradigm shift in 
the field of infectious disease diagnostics, offering unparalleled insights into 
microbial diversity and pathogenesis. While challenges persist, ongoing 
technological advancements hold immense potential to consolidate mNGS as a 
pivotal tool in the armamentarium of modern medicine, empowering clinicians with 
precise, rapid, and comprehensive pathogen detection capabilities.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pathogenic microbial infections are closely related to the 
development and prognosis of esophageal cancer. The distribution and resistance 
of pathogens in different diseases are regional and gradually change over time. 
This study aimed to determine the distribution and drug resistance of pathogens 
isolated from patients with esophageal cancer and provide a reference for the 
rational use of antibiotics.
METHODS: The results of strain identification and antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing of pathogens in patients with esophageal cancer from January 2013 to 
December 2022 at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. SPSS Statistics 
26.0 (IBM) and R software 4.3.1 were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 2322 non-repetitive pathogens were isolated from 14,037 
samples. Of all strains, 1713 (73.77%) were Gram-negative bacteria, 483 (20.80%) 
were Gram-positive bacteria, and 126 (5.43%) were fungi. The top 10 pathogens 
were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.81%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (12.88%), A. 
baumannii (9.91%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.82%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.54%), 
Candida albicans (3.92%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.19%), Escherichia coli 
(3.14%), Enterococcus faecalis (2.97%), and Serratia marcescens (2.15%). The 
isolation rate of S. maltophilia showed an upward trend (p < 0.05). The 
resistance rates of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, A. baumannii, and 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteria to some common antibiotics showed a tendency to 
change (p < 0.05), and 2019 became a turning point to some extent. All common 
Gram-positive pathogens were sensitive to vancomycin, except for three 
Enterococcus spp. isolates that showed intrinsic resistance. The prevalence of 
MRSA was 65.14% (114/175) in this study. In addition, the resistance rates of 
MRSA and MSSA to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, 
clindamycin, and penicillin were significantly different (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pathogens are diverse in patients with esophageal cancer, with the 
most common being P. aeruginosa, followed by S. maltophilia. The pathogens 
exhibited different patterns of resistance. Antibiotics should be used 
rationally according to pathogen resistance patterns.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the subgingival microbiota in subjects with stage 
I/II periodontitis (moderate periodontitis, MP), stage III/IV periodontitis 
(severe periodontitis, SP), and periodontal health (PH) at the same probing 
depth (PD) (shallow ≤ 3 mm, moderate 4-6 mm, or deep ≥ 7 mm), and to investigate 
the changes associated with probing depth progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 
subjects (16 MP, 17 SP and 17 PH), forming six groups: PHS (PH, shallow), MPS 
(MP, shallow), MPM (MP, moderate), SPS (SP, shallow), SPM (SP, moderate), and 
SPD (SP, deep). Samples were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.
RESULT: The subgingival microbiome showed significant differences associated 
with both PD and periodontitis stage (p < 0.05). With increasing PD, alpha 
diversity initially increased and then decreased. Pathogenic genera like 
Fusobacterium, Filifactor, and Porphyromonas increased, while health-associated 
genera like Streptococcus and Haemophilus decreased. At shallow sites, the PHS, 
MPS, and SPS groups showed similar community structure. At moderate and deep 
sites, the SPM and SPD groups exhibited significant differences in community 
structure compared to the MPM group, with the SPM and SPD groups showing 
decreased abundances of Actinomyces and increased abundances of Treponema. The 
microbial co-networks in the SPD and SPM groups exhibited greater complexity and 
connectivity and were more resilient to random microbial or node removal.
CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiome shows strong associations with PD and 
periodontitis stage.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Once periodontitis progresses to stage III/IV, 
reconstructing a healthy subgingival microbiome may be challenging, emphasizing 
the importance of early prevention.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate composition of gut microbial community in a rat model 
of functional dyspepsia (FD) and to explore the interventional effects of Simo 
Tang (, SMT).
METHODS: A rat model of FD was established through the tail-clamping stimulation 
method. The rat model of FD was assessed by the state of rats, their weight, 
sucrose preference rate, and intestinal propulsion rate. The DNA was extracted 
from stool samples after treatment with SMT. Amplified polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) products of the 16S rDNA were sequenced using NovaseQ6000 after 
construction of libraries. Composition of gut microbial community in the stool 
samples was determined and analyzed by cluster analysis, bioinformatic analysis, 
and analysis of α-diversity and β-diversity.
RESULTS: The rat model of FD was successfully established using the 
tail-clamping stimulation method. The statistical results of cluster analysis of 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed that the relative abundance of OTUs in 
the FD group was the lowest, while it was the highest in the normal (N) group. 
The composition of microbiome in the four groups was similar at phyla level. 
Compared with the FD group, the abundance of Firmicutes was downregulated, and 
the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was upregulated in the Simo 
Tang (SMT) and high-dose Simo Tang (SMT.G) groups. The ratio of Bacteroidetes/ 
Firmicutes was also elevated. According to the analysis of α-diversity and 
β-diversity, the abundance of flora in FD rats was significantly reduced. The 
treatment using SMT appeared beneficial to improve the diversity of flora. SMT 
could improve the intestinal flora in FD rats. The results showed that FD rats 
had intestinal flora imbalance, and species diversity increased. The results 
suggested that SMT could regulate the disorders of intestinal flora caused by 
FD.
CONCLUDIONS: SMT could restore gut homeostasis and maintain gut flora diversity 
by modulating the gut microbiota and its associated metabolites in rats, thereby 
treating gastrointestinal diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium paragordonae (MPG) is a novel and uncommon 
nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). We describe a case of MPG pulmonary disease 
(MPGPD) with a single, rapidly growing, pulmonary mass, which has rarely been 
reported.
CASE REPORT: A chest CT scan of a 66-year-old woman revealed a rapidly growing 
solitary mass-like lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung, which was not 
seen in the previous chest CT scan six months ago. H&E-stained section of the 
CT-guided percutaneous lung tissue biopsy specimen showed chronic inflammatory 
changes with epithelioid granulomas. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing 
(mNGS) of lung tissue biopsy specimen identified MPG with a sequence number of 
1617 and a confidence level of 99%. Because the subsequent MPG droplet digital 
PCR (MPG-ddPCR) test of the lung tissue biopsy was positive, she was eventually 
diagnosed with MPGPD. She was administered a quadruple oral regimen comprising 
clarithromycin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, and ethambutol according to the 
ATS/IDSA protocol for Mycobacterium gordonae (MG) infection. The chest CT scans 
showed a significant reduction in the lesion one month after the treatment and 
almost complete resolution four months later.
CONCLUSIONS: MPGPD is a rare NTM infection. The imaging manifestations of MPGPD 
are diverse and may even show rapid development. mNGS of tissue biopsy can 
enable prompt diagnosis of MPG infection and is a good alternative to routine 
NTM microbial testing. The ATS/IDSA protocol for MG infection is an effective 
treatment for MPG infection.

BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) species evolve slowly, so 
isolates from individuals linked in transmission often have identical or nearly 
identical genomes, making it difficult to reconstruct transmission chains. 
Finding additional sources of shared MTBC variation could help overcome this 
problem. Previous studies have reported MTBC diversity within infected 
individuals; however, whether within-host variation improves transmission 
inferences remains unclear. Here, we aimed to quantify within-host MTBC 
variation and assess whether such information improves transmission inferences.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study in which we 
reanalysed publicly available sequence data from household transmission studies 
published in PubMed from database inception until Jan 31, 2024, for which both 
genomic and epidemiological contact data were available, using household 
membership as a proxy for transmission linkage. We quantified minority variants 
(ie, positions with two or more alleles each supported by at least five-fold 
coverage and with a minor allele frequency of 1% or more) outside of PE and PPE 
genes, within individual samples and shared across samples. We used receiver 
operator characteristic (ROC) curves to compare the performance of a general 
linear model for household membership that included shared minority variants and 
one that included only fixed genetic differences.
FINDINGS: We identified three MTBC household transmission studies with publicly 
available whole-genome sequencing data and epidemiological linkages: a household 
transmission study in Vitória, Brazil (Colangeli et al), a retrospective 
population-based study of paediatric tuberculosis in British Columbia, Canada 
(Guthrie et al), and a retrospective population-based study in Oxfordshire, 
England (Walker et al). We found moderate levels of minority variation present 
in MTBC sequence data from cultured isolates that varied significantly across 
studies: mean 168·6 minority variants (95% CI 151·4-185·9) for the Colangeli 
et al dataset, 5·8 (1·5-10·2) for Guthrie et al (p<0·0001, Wilcoxon rank sum 
test, vs Colangeli et al), and 7·1 (2·4-11·9) for Walker et al (p<0·0001, 
Wilcoxon rank sum test, vs Colangeli et al). Isolates from household pairs 
shared more minority variants than did randomly selected pairs of isolates: mean 
97·7 shared minority variants (79·1-116·3) versus 9·8 (8·6-11·0) in Colangeli 
et al, 0·8 (0·1-1·5) versus 0·2 (0·1-0·2) in Guthrie et al, and 0·7 (0·1-1·3) 
versus 0·2 (0·2-0·2) in Walker et al (all p<0·0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). 
Shared within-host variation was significantly associated with household 
membership (odds ratio 1·51 [95% CI 1·30-1·71], p<0·0001), for one standard 
deviation increase in shared minority variants. Models that included shared 
within-host variation versus models without within-host variation improved the 
accuracy of predicting household membership in all three studies: area under the 
ROC curve 0·95 versus 0·92 for the Colangeli et al study, 0·99 versus 0·95 for 
the Guthrie et al study, and 0·93 versus 0·91 for the Walker et al study.
INTERPRETATION: Within-host MTBC variation persists through culture of sputum 
and could enhance the resolution of transmission inferences. The substantial 
differences in minority variation recovered across studies highlight the need to 
optimise approaches to recover and incorporate within-host variation into 
automated phylogenetic and transmission inference.

Our microbiota plays crucial roles in immune development and homeostasis and has 
been implicated in virtually all major diseases of the 21st century. 
Nevertheless, our understanding of the exact microbial functions that underlie 
these correlations remains extremely limited, due in large part to the 
difficulty of profiling cellular activities within non-model organisms and 
complex communities. Over the past decade, new flow cytometric approaches have 
been developed to distinguish specific microbial populations based on their 
interactions with metabolite analogs, modified biomolecules, and reactive 
compounds. By selecting and separating active microbes via 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, PRobe INcorporation for Targeted sequencing 
(PRINT-seq) has inspired innovative approaches to identify and characterize 
functional members of our microbiota. Here, we provide a broad overview of this 
evolving technology and summarize how this method has been recently employed as 
a diagnostic fingerprint for diverse microbial activities.

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) subjects might have their microenvironment 
changed due to pathogenesis and living environment. Whether the nasal microbe in 
AR children differs from healthy subjects and how it interplays with dermal, 
oral and indoor dust microbe needs to be elucidated.
METHODS: In this case-control study, we analyzed and compared the bacterial 
characterization and associations in nasal, dermal, oral swab samples and dust 
samples in 62 children with physician-diagnosed AR(cases) and 51 age- and 
gender-matched healthy ones with no history of allergic diseases(controls). 
Full-length 16S rRNA sequencing(swabs) and shotgun metagenomics(dust) were 
applied. Bacterial diversity, composition, abundance difference characteristics 
and fast expectation-maximization for microbial source tracking(FEAST) analysis 
were performed and compared between cases and controls.
RESULTS: The α-diversity of dust microorganisms in AR was lower than that in 
control group (P = 0.034), and the β-diversity indices of microorganisms in 
nasal cavity (P = 0.020), skin (P = 0.001) and dust (P = 0.004) were 
significantly different from those in control group. At species levels, a total 
of 10, 15, 12, and 15 bacterial species were differentially enriched in either 
cases or controls in nasal, dermal, oral, and dust samples, respectively(Linear 
Discriminant Analysis(LDA) score > 2, P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis was 
the single species simultaneously more abundant in nasal, dermal and dust 
samples in AR children. By FEAST analysis, 8.85% and 10.11% of S. epidermidis in 
AR dermal and dust samples came from nasal cavity. These proportions were 
significantly higher than those in controls (2.70% and 3.86%) (P < 0.05). The 
same significantly higher transfer proportions(P < 0.05) were observed for 
Staphylococcus aureus enriched in the nasal cavity in AR children. 
Classification models by random forest regression at species levels showed, 
bacterial species enriched in indoor dust, nasal and dermal samples had 
substantial power in distinguishing AR children from healthy ones, with the 
highest power in the dust samples (AUC = 0.88) followed by nasal(AUC = 0.81) and 
dermal ones(AUC = 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented the microbial enrichment characteristics in AR 
children both in the living environment(dust) and body sites exposed to 
environment through inhalation(nasal cavity), contact(skin) and ingestion(oral 
cavity) pathways, respectively. Nasal S.epidermidis and S.aureus had dominant 
influences on dust and other body sites in AR children.

BACKGROUND: Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory cicatricial skin 
disease that can lead to urethral stricture or even malignant transformation and 
the etiology is still unknown. This study comparatively analyzed the 
balanopreputial swab and urine microbiota simultaneously between male patients 
with LS urethral stricture (LSUS) and non-LS urethral stricture (non-LSUS).
METHODS: We prospectively included 31 male patients with LSUS and 30 with 
non-LSUS in this case-control study. Midstream urine samples and balanopreputial 
swabs were collected from each patient for the 16S V3-V4 hypervariable region 
sequencing. Operational taxonomic units were defined using a > 97% sequence 
similarity threshold. We compared the differences in alpha diversity, beta 
diversity, and microbial structure between the two groups.
RESULTS: Whether in swab or urine samples, there was no significant difference 
in alpha diversity between the two groups. Swab samples showed a significant 
difference in beta diversity (p = 0.001). For all individuals, composition 
analyses showed that the most abundant phyla were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in both samples. Additionally, the microbial 
communities of swab samples were significantly more similar to the communities 
of urine samples in the LSUS group (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota showed significant variation between LSUS and non-LSUS 
groups, suggesting that microecological imbalance may be closely related to the 
occurrence of LS. Urinary irritation may be related to the unique microbiota on 
the genital skin of patients with LSUS.

BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to survive, grow, and cause severe 
infections at different sites throughout the human body owing to its ability to 
sense diverse signals and precisely modulate target gene expression using its 
abundant signaling systems. Release of zinc (Zn) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
within the phagocyte are two major host strategies to defend against bacterial 
infections. It was previously shown that the response regulator CzcR controls 
global gene expression including catalase genes during Zn excess, but regulatory 
mechanisms of catalase gene expression and the role of CzcR in H2O2 tolerance 
remain unclear.
RESULTS: In the study, comparative transcriptome analysis comprehensively 
described the CzcR-dependent and -independent gene regulatory pattern in P. 
aeruginosa during Zn excess, which revealed the counteractive co-regulation of 
two key H2O2-detoxifying catalase genes katA and katB through CzcR-dependent and 
-independent pathways in response to Zn excess. Protein-DNA interaction assay 
demonstrated that CzcR negatively regulates the expression of catalase genes 
katA and katB by directly binding to their promoters. While interestingly, we 
further showed that CzcR positively regulates H2O2 tolerance by inducing the 
catalase activity during Zn excess.
CONCLUSION: This study reported the opposite functions of CzcR in negatively 
regulating the expression of catalase genes katA and katB but in positively 
regulating the activity of catalase and H2O2 tolerance during Zn excess in P. 
aeruginosa.

The rhizospheres of plants and soil microorganisms are intricately 
interconnected. Tea trees are cultivated extensively on the karst plateau of 
Guizhou Province, China; however, the understanding of the interactions among 
fungal communities, community taxa, and diseases impacting tea tree in the soil 
rhizosphere is limited. Our aim is to offer insights for the advancement of 
modern agriculture in ecologically fragile karst tea gardens, as well as 
microbiomics concepts for green and sustainable environmental development. This 
study utilized the internal transcribed spacer high-throughput sequencing 
technology to explore the symbiotic relationship between rhizosphere fungi and 
plant disease feedback in multiple tea estates across the Guizhou Plateau. The 
ecological preferences and environmental thresholds of fungi were investigated 
via environmental variables. Furthermore, a correlation was established between 
different taxa and individual soil functions. Research has indicated that tea 
leaf blight disrupts symbiotic connections among fungal groups. For various 
taxa, we found that numerous taxa consistently maintained core positions within 
the community, whereas rare taxa were able to stabilize due to a high proportion 
of positive effects. Additionally, abundant taxa presented a wider range of 
environmental feedback, whereas the rare taxon diversity presented a stronger 
positive association with the soil Z score. This study contributes to our 
understanding of the importance of rare taxa in plant rhizosphere soil 
processes. Emphasis should be placed on the role of rare taxa in pest and 
disease control within green agriculture while also strengthening systematic 
development and biogeographical research related to rare taxa in this 
region.IMPORTANCEIn this study, based on internal transcribed spacer 
high-throughput sequencing, fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil of tea 
trees and their interactions with the environment in karst areas were reported, 
and the symbiotic relationships of different fungal taxa and their feedback to 
the environment were described in detail by using the knowledge of microbial 
ecology. On this basis, it was found that tea tree diseases affect the symbiotic 
relationships of fungal taxa. At the same time, we found that rare taxa have 
stronger cooperative relationships in response to environmental changes and 
explored their participation in soil processes based on fungal trait sets. This 
study will provide basic data for the development of modern agriculture in tea 
gardens and theoretical basis for the sustainable prevention and control of tea 
tree diseases.

Fecal matter is recognized as both a reservoir and a transmission source for 
various antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs). However, the transcriptional 
activity of AMRGs in swine feces is not well understood. In addition, the effect 
of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the excretion of AMRGs has rarely 
been reported. Our study explored the diversity, abundance, transcriptional 
activity, and bacterial hosts of AMRGs in Tibetan and Duroc pig feces using 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing technologies. We discovered a 
significantly higher genomic abundance of AMRGs in the feces of Duroc pigs 
compared to Tibetan pigs (P < 0.001), although the transcript levels did not 
show a significant difference. The results showed that the core composition of 
AMRGs in pig feces varied considerably, with the most transcriptionally active 
AMRGs being oqxB, tetQ, Bla1, dfrA1, and amrB. Furthermore, the Firmicutes 
phylum is the main host of AMRGs. By transplanting fecal flora from Tibetan and 
Duroc pigs into the intestines of Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets after 
acute antibiotic exposure, we found that only Tibetan pig fecal flora 
significantly reduced AMRGs in the feces of DLY piglets (P < 0.05). The 
effectiveness of Tibetan pig fecal microorganisms in removing AMRGs from DLY pig 
feces was mainly influenced by microbial communities, especially the 
Bacteroidota phylum. These findings offer valuable insights for the prevention 
and control of AMRG pollution.
IMPORTANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first 
comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance gene (AMRGs) expression in 
the fecal microbiota of Tibetan and Duroc pigs, employing an integrated 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach. Our findings indicate a higher risk 
of AMRGs transmission in the feces of Duroc pigs compared to Tibetan pigs. Given 
the escalating antimicrobial resistance crisis, novel therapeutic interventions 
are imperative to mitigate gut colonization by pathogens and AMRGs. In this 
regard, we investigated the impact of fecal microbiota from Tibetan and Duroc 
pig sources on AMRGs excretion in Duroc Landrace Yorkshire (DLY) piglets' feces 
following acute antibiotic exposure. Remarkably, only fecal microbiota sourced 
from Tibetan pigs exhibited a reduction in AMRGs excretion in DLY piglets' 
feces. This underscores the significance of evaluating the presence of AMRGs 
within donor fecal microbiota for effective AMRGs decolonization strategies.

Goss's wilt and leaf blight of maize is an economically important disease caused 
by the Gram-positive bacterium, Clavibacter nebraskensis (Cn). Little is known 
about the ecology and pathogenesis of this bacterium. Here, we used phenotypic 
assays and a high-throughput whole-genome sequencing approach to explore 
among-strain variation in virulence and multistrain reproductive success in 
planta. Our survey of 41 strains revealed that more recently sampled strains 
tended to have higher virulence than strains sampled before 2010 and tended to 
be more genetically divergent from the reference strain, isolated in 1971. More 
detailed assays with a representative sample of 13 of these strains revealed 
that host genotype (resistant or susceptible) did not strongly affect strain 
success and that strain success in planta in multi-strain communities was not 
closely associated with virulence in single-strain assays. Two weakly virulent 
strains, CIC354 and CIC370, had the greatest reproductive success, whereas the 
most highly virulent strains did not significantly change in frequency in any 
host genotype. A genomic analysis revealed candidate genes, including putative 
virulence factors (i.e., a secreted cellulase), responsible for among-strain 
variation in reproductive success.IMPORTANCENon-pathogenic strains of many 
bacterial pathogens are reported to coexist with pathogenic strains in 
symptomatic plants. To understand the ecology and pathogenesis of the pathogen 
population, it is essential to study strain dynamics in the context of the host. 
We created a community of 13 strains exhibiting diverse virulence phenotypes and 
used this community to infect the host plant. We compared the strain frequency 
of these strains before and after the host infection. Contrary to our hypothesis 
of highly virulent strains being selected by the susceptible host, we found that 
weakly virulent strains were selected by both resistant and susceptible host 
lines. We identified several genes associated with strain frequency shifts 
suggesting their role in strain colonization, virulence, and fitness.

Phosphorothioation serves as a DNA backbone modification mechanism, wherein a 
sulfur atom substitutes the nonbridging oxygen atom within the phosphodiester, 
facilitated by the gene products of dndABCDE or sspABCD. The combination of 
dndABCDE with dndFGH forms a bona fide defense system, where the DndFGH protein 
complex exhibits DNA nickase and DNA translocase activities to prevent phage 
invasion. In this study, we identified that dndI, co-transcribed with dndFGH, 
can independently couple with iscS-dndBCDE as an anti-phage defense system. 
Moreover, we resolved the crystal structure of DndI from Salmonella at a 
resolution of 3.10 Å. We discovered that its residue Y25, residing within a 
hydrophobic region of DndI, is involved in phosphorothioate (PT) sensing. Upon 
sensing PT modifications at 5'-GPSAAC-3'/5'-GPSTTC-3', the ATPase activity of 
DndI is stimulated, which subsequently triggers a conformational transition, 
facilitating the dissociation of DndI from self-DNA, thereby allowing DndI to 
avoid cleaving self-DNA while restricting PT-deficient phage DNA. This research 
broadens the knowledge of the mechanistic diversity underlying PT-based defense 
systems and highlights their complexity in the course of evolution.

BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis (PDRP) is one of the most 
common complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Understanding the risk factors 
and etiological characteristics is indispensable for infection prevention and 
improving the outcome and life quality.
METHODS: A total of 70 PD patients were separated into the PDRP group (n=25) and 
the control group (n=45). Variables, including gender, age, body mass index, 
primary diseases, and history of basic diseases, in the two groups were analyzed 
to assess the risk factors of PDRP. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing 
(mNGS) and microbial culture were compared in detecting pathogenic 
microorganisms. Gut microbiota analysis was performed in 35 PDRP patients based 
on mNGS data.
RESULTS: Dialysis time and times of dialysate change were the risk factors of 
PDRP, and times of dialysate change was the independent risk factor of PDRP (p = 
0.046). mNGS produced higher sensitivity (65.79%) than microbial culture 
(36.84%) in identifying pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (four cases) were the most frequent pathogens causing 
PDRP, followed by Staphylococcus capitis (three cases). β diversity of the gut 
microbiota was significantly different between patients with fewer times of 
dialysate change (≤4) and more (>5), as well as between patients with 
gram-positive (G+) bacterial and gram-negative (G-) bacterial infection.
CONCLUSION: The dialysis time and times of dialysate changes not only are risk 
factors for peritonitis in PD patients but also stimulate significant changes in 
the gut microbiome structure in PDRP patients. These findings may provide a 
novel viewpoint for the management of patients with PDRP.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore the microbial variations and 
biomarkers in the oral environment of patients with persistent pulmonary nodules 
(pPNs) and to reveal the potential biological functions of the salivary 
microbiota in pPNs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 483 participants (141 
healthy controls and 342 patients with pPNs) from June 2022 and January 2024. 
Saliva samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene to assess microbial diversity and differential abundance. Seven advanced 
machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, 
multi-layer perceptron, naïve Bayes, random forest, gradient boosting decision 
tree, and LightGBM) were utilized to evaluate performance and identify key 
microorganisms, with fivefold cross-validation employed to ensure robustness. 
The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was employed to explain the 
contribution of these core microbiotas to the predictive model. Additionally, 
the PICRUSt2 algorithm was used to predict the microbial functions.
RESULTS: The salivary microbial composition in pPNs group showed significantly 
lower α- and β-diversity compared to healthy controls. A high-accuracy LightGBM 
model was developed, identifying six core genera-Fusobacterium, Solobacterium, 
Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Atopobium, and Peptostreptococcus-as pPNs 
biomarkers. Additionally, a visualization pPNs risk prediction system was 
developed. The immune responses and metabolic activities differences in salivary 
microbiota between the patients with pPNs and healthy controls were revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential clinical applications of the 
salivary microbiota for enable earlier detection and targeted interventions, 
offering significant promise for advancing clinical management and improving 
patient outcomes in pPNs.

IMPORTANCE: The composition of the gut microbiota is essential for a dog's 
health and its adaptation to the environment. Different bacteria can produce the 
same essential metabolites beneficial to health owing to bacterial functional 
redundancy in microbial communities.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the gut bacterial communities of dogs from 
different breeds, all kept under identical domestication conditions.
METHODS: Noninvasive sampling and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing were used 
to compare the composition and function of the gut microbiota of three dog 
breeds: the Chinese Kunming dog (CKD), German Shepherd dog (GSD), and Belgian 
Malinois dog (BMD).
RESULTS: The gut microbiota of the three dog breeds consisted of 257 species 
across 146 genera, 60 families, 35 orders, 15 classes, and 10 phyla. The 
dominant bacterial phyla across the three breeds were Firmicutes (57.44%), 
Fusobacteriota (28.86%), and Bacteroidota (7.63%), while the dominant bacterial 
genera across the three breeds were Peptostreptococcus (21.08%), Fusobacterium 
(18.50%), Lactobacillus (12.37%), and Cetobacter (10.29%). Further analysis 
revealed significant differences in the intestinal flora of the three breeds at 
the phylum and genus levels. The intestinal flora of BMD was significantly 
richer than that of CKD and GSD. The functional prediction and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the primary functions of 
the gut microbiota in these breeds were similar, with significant enrichment in 
various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, 
secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and microbial metabolism in different 
environments. The intestinal flora of these breeds also played a crucial role in 
genetic information processing, including transcription, translation, 
replication, and material transport.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results provide novel insights into the 
intestinal flora of intervention dogs and suggest novel methods to improve their 
health status, which help increase microbial diversity and normalize metabolite 
production in diseased dogs.

Hyalomma anatolicum and Rhipicephalus microplus are tick species that are 
important vectors of numerous pathogens affecting both humans and livestock. 
Endosymbionts, such as Coxiella-like endosymbionts (CLE), Francisella-like 
endosymbionts (FLE), and Candidatus Midichloria, play a crucial role in the 
physiology and vector competence of these ticks. In this study, we investigated 
the microbial composition of H. anatolicum and R. microplus from four 
geographically distinct regions of Pakistan to assess whether environmental 
differences influence their microbiomes. We analyzed the ticks' gut microbiome 
targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA for Illumina 16S metagenome 
NGS sequencing and processed overall 144 ticks. Analysis of gut bacterial 
composition resulted in observation of 1200 R. microplus and 968 H. anatolicum 
unique amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Relative abundance, Alpha diversity 
(Shannon, Faith's phylogenetic distance) and beta diversity metrics 
(Bray-Curtis, Jaccard and UniFrac) were analyzed and revealed that H. anatolicum 
ticks have significantly unique and diverse microbial communities with 
Acinetobacter indicus and Francisella-like endosymbionts dominating as opposed 
to Candidatus Midichloria. Rhipicephalus microplus exhibited results consistent 
with the previous studies with no major changes in microbiome including 
Coxiella-like endosymbionts as the major contributor. These findings suggest 
that geographical and environmental factors play a significant role in shaping 
the tick microbiome, with potential consequences for disease transmission and 
tick survivability. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional roles 
of these microbial shifts and their impact on public health and livestock in 
affected regions.

Publisher: TITLE: Étude comparative des microbiomes des tiques Rhipicephalus 
microplus et Hyalomma anatolicum.
ABSTRACT: Hyalomma anatolicum et Rhipicephalus microplus sont des espèces de 
tiques qui sont d’importants vecteurs de nombreux agents pathogènes affectant à 
la fois les humains et le bétail. Les endosymbiontes, tels ceux de type Coxiella 
(CLE), de type Francisella (FLE) et Candidatus Midichloria, jouent un rôle 
crucial dans la physiologie et la compétence vectorielle de ces tiques. Dans 
cette étude, nous avons étudié la composition microbienne de H. anatolicum et R. 
microplus de quatre régions géographiquement distinctes du Pakistan pour évaluer 
si les différences environnementales influencent leurs microbiomes. Nous avons 
analysé le microbiome intestinal des tiques en ciblant la région hypervariable 
v3-v4 de l’ARNr 16S pour le séquençage 16S NGS Illumina du métagénome et avons 
traité au total 144 tiques. L’analyse de la composition bactérienne intestinale 
a permis d’observer 1200 (R. microplus) et 968 (H. anatolicum) variants de 
séquençage d’amplicons (ASV) uniques. L’abondance relative, la diversité alpha 
(distance phylogénétique de Shannon, Faith) et les mesures de diversité bêta 
(Bray–Curtis, Jaccard et UniFrac) ont été analysées, ce qui a révélé que les 
tiques H. anatolicum ont des communautés microbiennes particulièrement uniques 
et diversifiées, avec des endosymbiontes de type Acinetobacter indicus et 
Francisella dominants, par opposition à Candidatus Midichloria. Rhipicephalus 
microplus a présenté des résultats cohérents avec les études précédentes, sans 
changement majeur du microbiome, y compris les endosymbiontes de type Coxiella 
comme contributeurs majeurs. Ces résultats suggèrent que les facteurs 
géographiques et environnementaux jouent un rôle important dans la formation du 
microbiome des tiques, avec des conséquences potentielles sur la transmission 
des maladies et la survie des tiques. Des recherches supplémentaires sont 
nécessaires pour élucider les rôles fonctionnels de ces changements microbiens 
et leur impact sur la santé publique et le bétail dans les régions touchées.

University, Ankara, Türkiye.

The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, affecting metabolic, 
immune, and cognitive functions. While the impact of various dietary components 
on the microbiome is well-studied, the effect of legumes remains less explored. 
This review examines the influence of legume consumption on gut microbiome 
composition, diversity, and metabolite production, based on 10 human and 21 
animal studies. Human studies showed mixed results, with some showing increased 
microbial diversity and others finding no significant changes. However, legume 
consumption was linked to increases in beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium 
and Faecalibacterium. Animal studies generally indicated enhanced microbial 
diversity and composition changes, though these varied by legume type and the 
host's health. Some studies highlighted legume-induced shifts in bacteria 
associated with better metabolic health. Overall, the review emphasizes the 
complexity of legume-microbiome interactions and the need for standardized 
methodologies and longitudinal studies. While legumes have the potential to 
positively affect the gut microbiome, the effects are nuanced and depend on 
context. Future research should investigate the long-term impacts of legume 
consumption on microbiome stability and its broader health implications, 
particularly for disease prevention and dietary strategies.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Short sleep duration (SSD) affects people's health in 
multiple ways. This study attempted to explore the effect of SSD on the gut 
microbiota.
METHODS: In the American Gut Project Database, 361 individuals (without troubled 
by disease recently) with less than 6 h of sleep per day were obtained and 
matched with normal sleep time individuals according to gender, age, and BMI. 
Furthermore, the raw data of 16s rRNA in feces were downloaded and analyzed 
using QIIME2, and STAMP was used for data statistics. PICRUST2 was used for 
predicting the alteration of microbial function.
RESULTS: The SSD did not affect the microbial α-diversity. SSD increased the 
abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and the families Rikenellaceae, 
Verrucomicrobiaceae, and S24-7, and decrased the Coriobacteriaceae. Moreover, 
PICRUST2 predicted that SSD affected 15 metabolic pathways. Subgroup analyses 
showed that SSD had more significant effects on the microbiota in normal-weight 
females.
CONCLUSION: SSD substantially modifies the abundance of specific gut microbiota 
taxa, exerting a pronounced influence particularly on females, highlighting the 
need for further investigation into the bidirectional relationship between sleep 
patterns and gut microbiota.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a 
significant global health issue, affecting over 30% of the population worldwide 
due to the rising prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This spectrum of liver disease ranges from isolated 
steatosis to more severe forms such as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 
Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in MASLD pathogenesis, 
showing that dysbiosis significantly impacts metabolic health and the 
progression of liver disease. This review critically evaluates current 
microbiome-centered therapies in MASLD management, including prebiotics, 
probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and emerging 
therapies such as engineered bacteria and bacteriophage therapy. We explore the 
scientific rationale, clinical evidence, and potential mechanisms by which these 
interventions influence MASLD. The gut-liver axis is crucial in MASLD, with 
notable changes in microbiome composition linked to disease progression. For 
instance, specific microbial profiles and reduced alpha diversity are associated 
with MASLD severity. Therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome could 
modulate disease progression by improving gut permeability, reducing 
endotoxin-producing bacteria, and altering bile acid metabolism. Although 
promising, these therapies require further research to fully understand their 
mechanisms and optimize their efficacy. This review integrates findings from 
clinical trials and experimental studies, providing a comprehensive overview of 
microbiome-centered therapies' potential in managing MASLD. Future research 
should focus on personalized strategies, utilizing microbiome features, blood 
metabolites, and customized dietary interventions to enhance the effectiveness 
of these therapies.

There is increasing interest in utilizing senolytics to selectively remove 
senescent cells from intestinal tissues, with the aim of maintaining a healthy 
gut environment during aging. This strategy underscores the potential of 
senolytics to enhance gut health by delaying intestinal aging and positively 
modulating gut microbiota. Certain plant-based phytochemicals have demonstrated 
promising senolytic effects. Beyond their ability to eliminate senescent cells, 
these compounds also exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, 
reducing oxidative stress and inflammation-key drivers of age-related diseases. 
By selectively removing senescent cells from the intestine, senolytic 
phytochemicals contribute to an improved intestinal inflammatory environment and 
promote the growth of a diverse microbial community. Ultimately, the dietary 
intake of these senolytic phytochemicals aids in maintaining a healthier 
intestinal microenvironment by targeting and clearing aged enterocytes.

Global warming and heavy metals have become the major threat to the growth and 
reproduction of corals. However, unlike scleractinian corals, in the context of 
widespread coral degradation worldwide, there are few reports on the response of 
octocorallia corals to high-temperature stress and heavy metals. In the present 
study, we conducted indoor simulation experiments using Junceella squamata. We 
evaluated the physiological response of these corals under high-temperature 
stress at 33 °C and cadmium (Cd) stress by comparing the composition and 
diversity of their symbiotic bacteria and analyzing differences in their 
transcriptome. The results show that high-temperature stress has more severe 
adverse effects than cadmium stress. High-temperature stress disrupts coral 
symbiotic relationships, leading to an increase in alpha diversity associated 
with disease-causing bacteria, which may increase the risk of infection and 
potentially contribute to coral mortality. Meanwhile, cadmium stress increases 
the instability of the coral holobiont, potentially disrupting DNA stability and 
RNA transcriptional regulation. However, an increase in Cd-tolerant bacteria may 
help corals respond to cadmium stress. This study reveals the effects of harmful 
substances on coral and highlights the urgent need for action to protect 
octocorals in the face of environmental stress.

communities and functions with the potential risk of pathogen transmission to 
captive Asian small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinereus).

Captive otters raised in zoos are fed different artificial diets, which may 
shape gut microbiota. The objective is to evaluate the impacts of two different 
artificial diets on microbial communities and function capabilities and 
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in healthy otters' feces. A total of 16 
Asian small-clawed otters in two groups (n = 8) were selected. Group A otters 
were fed raw loaches supplemented with commercial cat food (LSCF) diet, and 
group B otters were fed raw crucian diet. The communities and functional 
capabilities of microbiota in feces were assessed with metagenomic sequencing. 
Captive otters fed two kinds of diets possessed different gut microbial 
communities and functional capabilities. Various pathogenic bacteria, like 
Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, were enriched in the samples from 
the two groups, respectively. Most of the differential pathways of nutrient 
metabolism were significantly enriched in group A, and the distributions of 
carbohydrate enzymes in the two groups significantly differed from each other. 
Multiple resistance genes markedly accumulated in fecal samples of the group A 
otters with LSCF diet. Higher concentrations of SCFAs were also observed in 
group A otters. Two feeding strategies were both likely to facilitate the 
colonization and expansion of various pathogenic bacteria and the accumulation 
of resistance genes in the intestines of captive otters, suggesting that risk of 
pathogen transmission existed in the current feeding process. Commercial cat 
food could supplement various nutrients and provide a substrate for the 
production of SCFAs, which might be beneficial for the otters' intestinal 
fermentation and metabolism.
IMPORTANCE: Captive otters fed with different diets possessed distinct gut 
microbial communities and functions, with the enrichment of several pathogens 
and multiple resistance genes in their gut microbiota. The current artificial 
feeding strategies had the possibility to accelerate the colonization and 
proliferation of various pathogenic bacteria in the intestines of otters and the 
spread of resistance genes, increasing the risk of diseases. In addition, 
supplementation with commercial cat food had benefits for otters' intestinal 
fermentation and the metabolism of gut microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: The oral microbiota is the second largest microbiota in the human 
body and has a significant impact on human health. Recent evidence suggests that 
dysbiosis of the oral microbiota may be associated with the development of 
metabolism-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This review aimed to validate 
the relationship between oral microbial diversity and the development of MAFLD.
METHODS: A systematic evaluation was performed based on PRISMA guidelines. Three 
independent reviewers searched for relevant literature in several databases, 
including PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, with a search date ranging 
from the establishment of the databases to June 2024.
RESULTS: A total of 1278 publications were initially screened, including five 
cross-sectional studies, seven case-control studies, one cohort study, and one 
retrospective study. These studies included a total of 3335 patients with MAFLD, 
254 patients with MASH, and 105 patients with liver cirrhosis. All 14 included 
studies concluded that there was a correlation or potential correlation between 
oral microbiota and MAFLD. Seven studies found that the composition of the oral 
microbiota in MAFLD patients differed from that of healthy controls, and 
specific oral bacteria may be associated with an increased incidence of MAFLD. 
At the phylum level, several studies found differences in the abundance of the 
phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Clostridia compared to healthy controls. 
Additionally, a study on oral fungi found significant differences in the phyla 
Proteobacteria and in the genus Staphylococcus between patients with MAFLD and 
healthy controls. At the genus level, Porphyromonas was studied most frequently, 
with all 8 studies identifying infection with Porphyromonas as a significant 
risk factor for pathological progression in MAFLD. Furthermore, a dysbiosis in 
the ratio of Porphyromonas gingivalis./Porphyromonas anomalies may be an 
important marker of MAFLD progression.
CONCLUSION: There is an important association between the diversity of oral 
microbiota composition and MAFLD. This finding suggests the importance of oral 
health assessment and monitoring for the prevention or intervention of MAFLD.

BACKGROUND: Aging can impair the ability of elderly individuals to fight 
infections and trigger persistent systemic inflammation, a condition known as 
inflammaging. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of inflammaging 
remain unknown.
METHODS: We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing of intestinal contents from young and 
old C57BL/6J mice to elucidate changes in gut microbiota diversity and microbial 
community composition after aging. Aging-related differential bacterial taxa 
were then identified, and their abundance trends were validated in human 
samples. The variances in intestinal barrier function and circulating endotoxin 
between groups were also assessed. Furthermore, widely targeted metabolomics was 
conducted to characterize metabolic profiles after aging and to investigate the 
key metabolic pathways enriched by the differential metabolites.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated an increase in relative proportion of 
pathogenic bacteria with age, a trend also revealed in healthy populations of 
different age groups. Additionally, aging individuals exhibited reduced 
intestinal barrier function and increased circulating endotoxin levels. Widely 
targeted metabolomics revealed a significant increase in various secondary bile 
acid metabolites after aging, positively correlated with the relative abundance 
of several aging-related bacterial taxa. Furthermore, old group had lower levels 
of various anti-inflammatory or beneficial metabolites. Enrichment analysis 
identified the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway as potentially the most 
significantly impacted signaling pathway during aging.
CONCLUSION: This study aimed to provide insights into the complex interactions 
involved in organismal inflammaging through microbial multi-omics. These 
findings lay a solid foundation for future research aimed at identifying novel 
biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of aging-related diseases or potential 
therapeutic targets.

Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne virus that causes severe 
meningoencephalitis in the United States, Canada, and Russia. Serology is 
generally the preferred diagnostic modality, but PCR on cerebrospinal fluid, 
blood, or urine has an important role, particularly in immunocompromised 
patients who are unable to mount a serologic response. Although the perceived 
poor sensitivity of PCR in the general population may be due to the biology of 
infection and health-seeking behavior (with short viremic periods that end 
before hospital presentation), limitations in assay design may also contribute. 
Genome sequences from clinical POWV cases are extremely scarce; PCR assay design 
has been informed by those available, but the numbers are limited. Larger 
numbers of genome sequences from tick-derived POWV are available, but it is not 
known if POWV genomes from human infections broadly mirror genomes from tick 
hosts, or if human infections are caused by a subset of more virulent strains. 
We obtained viral genomic data from 10 previously unpublished POWV human 
infections and showed that they broadly mirror the diversity of genome sequences 
seen in ticks, including all three major clades (lineage I, lineage II 
Northeast, and lineage II Midwest). These newly published clinical POWV genome 
sequences include the first confirmed lineage I infection in the United States, 
highlighting the relevance of all clades in human disease. An in silico analysis 
of published POWV PCR assays shows that many assays were optimized against a 
single clade and have mismatches that may affect their sensitivity when applied 
across clades. This analysis serves as a launching point for improved PCR design 
for clinical diagnostics and environmental surveillance.

Recent studies have shown a growing interest in the complex relationship between 
the human gut microbiota, metabolism, and overall health. This review aims to 
explore the gut microbiota-host association, focusing on its implications for 
precision nutrition and personalized medicine. The objective is to highlight how 
gut microbiota modulate metabolic and immune functions, contributing to disease 
susceptibility and wellbeing. The review synthesizes recent research findings, 
analyzing key studies on the influence of gut microbiota on lipid and 
carbohydrate metabolism, intestinal health, neurobehavioral regulation, and 
endocrine signaling. Data were drawn from both experimental and clinical trials 
examining microbiota-host interactions relevant to precision nutrition. Our 
findings highlight the essential role of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in 
regulating host metabolism, including lipid and glucose pathways. These 
metabolites have been found to influence immune responses and gut barrier 
integrity. Additionally, the microbiota impacts broader physiological processes, 
including neuroendocrine regulation, which could be crucial for dietary 
interventions. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of 
dietary-microbiota-host interactions is pivotal for advancing personalized 
nutrition strategies. Tailored dietary recommendations based on individual gut 
microbiota compositions hold promise for improving health outcomes, potentially 
revolutionizing future healthcare approaches across diverse populations.

Chlamys farreri is primarily cultivated in Japan, China, and South Korea. 
Although mass mortality of scallops has been occurring recently, likely caused 
by high temperatures or infectious diseases, the underlying cause remains 
unclear. Little is known regarding the viral diseases affecting them. Therefore, 
we explored DNA virus diversity in the mid-gut gland of C. farreri and compared 
it with that of seawater. C. farreri was cultivated at depths below 5 m from the 
sea surface in the coastal waters of South Korea and sampled from May to August 
2018. Different DNA viral communities were observed in both C. farreri and 
seawater. In C. farreri, prevalent groups included Mimiviridae (7%), Poxviridae 
(6%), and Phycodnaviridae (5%). Conversely, the dominant groups in seawater were 
Autographiviridae (20%), Kyanoviridae (12%), and Zobellviridae (10%). We 
identified C. farreri-specific viral communities and potentially infectious 
viruses, such as Ostreid herpesvirus 1 and Abalone herpesvirus 
Victoria/AUS/2009. Furthermore, C. farreri acts as a reservoir for various 
viruses, which impact microbial community dynamics and disease transmission in 
marine ecosystems. Understanding these viral communities is crucial to 
protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems by highlighting their role in the 
transmission of potential avian- and bivalve-specific viruses.

The intricate relationship between hydrogen sulfide (H2S), gut microbiota, and 
sirtuins (SIRTs) can be seen as a paradigm axis in maintaining cellular 
homeostasis, modulating oxidative stress, and promoting mitochondrial health, 
which together play a pivotal role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. H2S, 
a gasotransmitter synthesized endogenously and by specific gut microbiota, acts 
as a potent modulator of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, protecting 
against cellular damage. Through sulfate-reducing bacteria, gut microbiota 
influences systemic H2S levels, creating a link between gut health and metabolic 
processes. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in microbial populations, can alter H2S 
production, impair mitochondrial function, increase oxidative stress, and 
heighten inflammation, all contributing factors in neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, are 
NAD+-dependent deacetylases that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant 
defense, and inflammation. H2S enhances sirtuin activity through 
post-translational modifications, such as sulfhydration, which activate sirtuin 
pathways essential for mitigating oxidative damage, reducing inflammation, and 
promoting cellular longevity. SIRT1, for example, deacetylates NF-κB, reducing 
pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, while SIRT3 modulates key mitochondrial 
enzymes to improve energy metabolism and detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
This synergy between H2S and sirtuins is profoundly influenced by the gut 
microbiota, which modulates systemic H2S levels and, in turn, impacts sirtuin 
activation. The gut microbiota-H2S-sirtuin axis is also essential in regulating 
neuroinflammation, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Pharmacological interventions, including H2S donors 
and sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs), promise to improve these pathways 
synergistically, providing a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative 
conditions. This suggests that maintaining gut microbiota diversity and 
promoting optimal H2S levels can have far-reaching effects on brain health.

There is still a pressing need for further investigation to bridge the gap in 
understanding the differences in gut microbiota composition between female 
runners and their male counterparts. We aimed to determine the gut microbiota 
composition in competitive non-professional female and male runners and to 
correlate the gut bacteria to performance. Our study included 40 subjects, of 
which 22 were runners (13 males and 9 females) and 18 control subjects (9 males 
and 9 females, representing the general population who perform light physical 
activity with a weekly running volume of ≤5 km per week). Fecal specimens were 
collected and analyzed for taxonomic profiling to compare species' relative 
abundances between males and females based on the results of 16SrRNA analysis. 
Bacterial alpha and beta diversity were assessed to determine the differences in 
microbial composition between runners and controls, and between sexes. Each 
participant underwent a maximal oxygen consumption test and a time-to-exhaustion 
test at 85% of the measured VO2max. Blood lactate was collected every 5 min 
during the tests. Bacterial alpha diversity showed a significant difference (p = 
0.04) between runners and controls. Taxonomic analysis of gut microbiota 
composition showed a lower Enterobacteriaceae abundance and a higher 
Methanosphaera abundance in runners compared with the control group. Ten 
different bacteria (Methanosphaera, Mitsuokella, Prevotellaceae, Megamonas, 
Rothia, Oscillospira, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Blautia massiliensis, 
Butyricicoccus_pullicaecorum) were positively correlated with exercise (VO2max, 
lactate blood levels, time to exhaustion, and weekly training volume). We found 
no significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between male and 
female runners. Gut microbiota composition positively correlates with sports 
performance in competitive non-professional female and male runners, and female 
runners show similar gut microbiome diversity to male runners.

Background/Objectives: Evidence of the association between the gut microbiome 
and cardiovascular diseases has accumulated. An imbalance or dysbiosis of this 
system has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
events, including aortic diseases. We aimed to elucidate the findings of the gut 
microbial taxonomy associated with aortic diseases and their subtypes. 
Furthermore, we sought to investigate whether gut microbiome dysbiosis can be 
used as a biomarker for aortic disease detection and to identify which species 
can be disease-specific. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
guidelines for original research papers on gut microbiome composition in 
patients with aortic disease, using patients without aortic disease as the 
control (i.e., healthy controls). The databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and 
Web of Science were used by employing the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms 
"aortic diseases", "microbiome"," microbiota", and "taxa" before August 2024. We 
extracted the study characteristics, study population, and gut microbiome in 
aortic disease, including microbiota taxa diversity and abundance, regardless of 
taxa level. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool was 
used to assess study quality. Data were synthesized narratively to address the 
heterogeneity of the studies. Results: In this review, twelve studies that have 
identified gut microbial species and their potential impact on aortic disease 
pathogenesis were included. The studies showed the phyla dominance of Bacillota, 
Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota, and Euryarchaeota in aortic 
disease patients. We also included the taxa sequencing methods and those used to 
extract the microorganisms. Aortic diseases were categorized into Takayasu's 
arteritis, giant cell arteritis, aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection. Aortic 
disease patients had a higher rate of dysbiosis when compared to the healthy 
control groups, with significantly different microbiome composition. 
Conclusions: Patients with aortic disease exhibit a distinct difference between 
their gut microbiota composition and that of the healthy controls, which 
suggests a potential biomarker role of gut dysbiosis. Further exploration of the 
microbiome and its metagenome interface can help identify its role in aortic 
disease pathogenesis in depth, generating future therapeutic options. However, a 
unified methodology is required to identify potential microbial biomarkers in 
cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases.

Anthocyanins (ACs) have been shown to elicit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
effects in animal models of ulcerative colitis (UC). Furthermore, we previously 
observed in a double-blind randomized trial in UC patients that biochemical 
disease activity tended to be lower in patients that were exposed to AC. Here, 
we report on the changes in the fecal microbiome composition in these patients 
upon AC exposure. UC patients received a 3 g daily dose of an AC-rich bilberry 
extract (ACRE) for eight weeks. We determined the microbiome composition in 
longitudinal stool samples from 24 patients and quantified the degree of change 
over time. We also correlated the relative abundances of individual microbial 
taxa at different timepoints to fecal concentrations of calprotectin, a proxy 
for inflammation. Microbiome composition did not change over time as a result of 
the intervention, in terms of both alpha and beta diversity. However, before the 
intervention, the abundance of Haemophilus parainfluenzae was positively 
correlated with fecal calprotectin concentrations, and this correlation 
persisted in placebo-treated subjects throughout the study. In contrast, the 
correlation between H. parainfluenzae and calprotectin vanished in ACRE-treated 
subjects, while the relative abundance of H. parainfluenzae did not change. Our 
results suggest that ACRE treatment mitigates the contribution of H. 
parainfluenzae to inflammation. Further research is warranted to better 
comprehend the role of microbial composition in response to medical therapy 
including AC-rich extract in UC patients.

Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. is considered an important medicinal herb with 
extremely high economic value and medicinal value due to its various effects, 
including anti-oxidation, sedative action, hepatoprotection, and invigorating 
blood circulation. However, L. chuanxiong cultivation is hampered by various 
plant diseases, especially the root rot caused by Fusarium solani, hindering the 
sustainable development of the L. chuanxiong industry. The occurrence of 
soil-borne diseases is closely linked to imbalances in the microbial community 
structure. Here, we studied the yields, rhizosphere microbiota, and soil 
physiochemical characteristics of healthy and diseased L. chuanxiong plants 
affected by root rot with high-throughput sequencing and microbial network 
analysis, aiming to explore the relationships between soil environmental 
factors, microbiomes, and plant health of L. chuanxiong. According to the 
results, L. chuanxiong root rot significantly decreased the yields, altered 
microbial community diversity and composition, enriched more pathogenic fungi, 
recruited some beneficial bacteria, and reduced microbial interaction network 
stability. The Mantel test showed that soil organic matter and pH were the major 
environmental factors modulating plant microbiome assembly. The root rot 
severity was significantly affected by soil physiochemical properties, including 
organic matter, cation exchange capacity, available nitrogen, phosphorus, 
potassium, and pH. Furthermore, two differential microbes that have great 
potential in the biocontrol of L. chuanxiong root rot were dug out in the 
obtained results, which were the genera Trichoderma and Bacillus. This study 
provided a theoretical basis for further studies revealing the microecological 
mechanism of L. chuanxiong root rot and the ecological prevention and control of 
L. chuanxiong root rot from a microbial ecology perspective.

Recent advances have highlighted the gut microbiota as a significant contributor 
to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which is an inflammatory 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) characterized by plaque buildup within arterial 
walls. The gut microbiota, consisting of a diverse collection of microorganisms, 
impacts the host's metabolism, immune responses, and lipid processing, all of 
which contribute to atherosclerosis. This review explores the complex mechanisms 
through which gut dysbiosis promotes atherogenesis. We emphasize the potential 
of integrating microbiota modulation with traditional cardiovascular care, 
offering a holistic approach to managing atherosclerosis. Important pathways 
involve the translocation of inflammatory microbial components, modulation of 
lipid metabolism through metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and 
the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence vascular 
health. Studies reveal distinct microbial profiles in atherosclerosis patients, 
with increased pathogenic bacteria (Megamonas, Veillonella, Streptococcus) and 
reduced anti-inflammatory genera (Bifidobacterium, Roseburia), highlighting the 
potential of these profiles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Probiotics 
are live microorganisms that have health benefits on the host. Prebiotics are 
non-digestible dietary fibers that stimulate the growth and activity of 
beneficial gut bacteria. Interventions targeting microbiota, such as probiotics, 
prebiotics, dietary modifications, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), 
present effective approaches for restoring microbial equilibrium and justifying 
cardiovascular risk. Future research should focus on longitudinal, multi-omics 
studies to clarify causal links and refine therapeutic applications.

The prolonged practice of continuous potato cropping, coupled with inadequate 
field management, disrupts the soil bacterial community equilibrium. Such 
disturbances compromise the resilience of the soil ecosystem, predisposing it to 
an increased incidence of potato diseases. However, the effects of the 
phosphorus fertiliser application rate on the rhizosphere soil bacterial 
community composition of potatoes and the occurrence of potato common scab (CS) 
have not been adequately studied. Here, diseased field soils from Dingxi and 
Huidong Counties were collected for potting tests, and field tests were 
conducted in Huidong County for validation. An examination of the relationship 
between the bacterial community composition in the potato rhizosphere soil and 
potato CS under different phosphate fertiliser treatments was conducted using 
16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results show that a lower phosphorus 
fertiliser application rate was more conducive to maintaining soil bacterial 
community diversity under different phosphorus fertiliser treatments in 
different habitats. In addition, the relative abundance of the txtA gene 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increase in the phosphate fertiliser 
application rate. Field trials conducted in Huidong revealed that treatments F1, 
F2, and F3 had respective CS incidence rates of 28.33%, 46.67%, and 59.44%, 
while their corresponding disease severity indices were 7.67, 17.33, and 29.44. 
Further analysis revealed that the relative abundance of antagonistic genera of 
pathogenic S. scabies decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with increases in the 
phosphorus fertiliser application rate. In summary, the correlation between 
potato CS and changes in the bacterial community of rhizosphere soil was used to 
determine the optimal phosphorus application rate during potato production, 
which can provide a scientific basis for the management of phosphorus fertiliser 
in potato farmland.

The importance of microbial communities in fish hatcheries for fish health and 
welfare has been recognized, with several studies mapping these communities 
during healthy rearing conditions and disease outbreaks. In this study, we 
analyzed the bacteriome of the live feeds, such as microalgae, rotifers, and 
Artemia, used in fish hatcheries that produce Mediterranean species. Our goal 
was to provide baseline information about their structure, emphasizing in 
environmental putative fish pathogenic bacteria. We conducted 16S rRNA amplicon 
Novaseq sequencing for our analysis, and we inferred 46,745 taxonomically 
annotated ASVs. Results showed that incoming environmental water plays a 
significant role in the presence of important taxa that constitute presumptive 
pathogens. Bio-statistical analyses revealed a relatively stable bacteriome 
among seasonal samplings for every hatchery but a diverse bacteriome between 
sampling stations and a distinct core bacteriome for each hatchery. Analysis of 
putative opportunistic fish pathogenic genera revealed some co-occurrence 
correlation events and a high average relative abundance of Vibrio, 
Tenacibaculum, and Photobacterium genera in live feeds, reaching a grand mean 
average of up to 7.3% for the hatchery of the Hellenic Center of Marine Research 
(HCMR), 12% for Hatchery A, and 11.5% for Hatchery B. Mapping the bacteriome in 
live feeds is pivotal for understanding the marine environment and distinct 
aquaculture practices and can guide improvements in hatchery management, 
enhancing fish health and sustainability in the Mediterranean region.

Panax plants are known for their significant medicinal and economic value. Being 
perennial, they are prone to soil-borne diseases during cultivation. However, 
there has been limited research on the pathogenesis of soil-borne diseases and 
the diversity of pathogens. While biological control has gained attention for 
its efficacy and environmental benefits, the factors affecting its efficiency 
still need thorough evaluation. This review summarizes the influence of biotic 
factors, such as pathogens and hosts, and environmental factors on the 
occurrence of soil-borne diseases and pathogen diversity. Additionally, we 
synthesized bacterial, actinobacterial, and fungal diversity for the biocontrol 
of soil-borne diseases and their functional mechanisms. Moreover, the review 
delves into the factors influencing the efficacy of biocontrol, including 
microbial species, the inoculation method and inoculation volume, and inoculant 
composition. This article serves as a valuable resource for enhancing the 
efficiency of biological control and optimizing strategies for managing 
soil-borne diseases in Panax cultivation in the future.

This review explores the complex relationship between gut dysbiosis and 
hematological malignancies, focusing on graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. We 
discuss how alterations in microbial diversity and composition can influence 
disease development, progression, and treatment outcomes in blood cancers. The 
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota impacts these conditions are examined, 
including modulation of immune responses, production of metabolites, and effects 
on intestinal barrier function. Recent advances in microbiome-based therapies 
for treating and preventing GvHD are highlighted, with emphasis on full 
ecosystem standardized donor-derived products. Overall, this review underscores 
the growing importance of microbiome research in hematology-oncology and its 
potential to complement existing treatments and improve outcomes for thousands 
of patients worldwide.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of widespread morbidity and 
mortality. It has been found that the gut and oral microbiomes differ in 
individuals with CVDs compared to healthy individuals. Patients with CVDs often 
require long-term pharmacological interventions. While these medications have 
been extensively studied for their cardiovascular benefits, emerging research 
indicates that they may also impact the diversity and composition of the oral 
and gut microbiomes. However, our understanding of how these factors influence 
the compositions of the oral and gut microbiomes in individuals remains limited. 
Studies have shown that statins and beta-blockers, in particular, cause gut and 
oral microbial dysbiosis, impacting the metabolism and absorption of these 
medications. These alterations can lead to variations in drug responses, 
highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches. The microbiome's 
role in drug metabolism and the impact of CVD medications on the microbiome are 
crucial in understanding these variations. However, there are very few studies 
in this area, and not all medications have been studied, emphasizing the 
necessity for further research to conclusively establish cause-and-effect 
relationships and determine the clinical significance of these interactions. 
This review will provide evidence of how the oral and gut microbiomes in 
patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) interact with specific drugs used 
in CVD treatment.

Penicillium expansum causes blue mold, a major post-harvest disease affecting 
apples. This disease is commonly managed using fungicides, including 
Difenoconazole (Dif), a demethylation inhibitor (DMI) approved for its control. 
This investigation aims to evaluate the baseline sensitivity of 100 P. expansum 
isolates to Difenoconazole. The isolates were collected from symptomatic apples 
in 34 storage warehouses across the Fes-Meknes and Draa-Tafilalet regions over 
three years (2020, 2021, and 2022). The study revealed an increase in the 
percentage of inhibition of mycelial growth and spore germination of P. expansum 
proportional to the increasing concentration of the fungicide. Moreover, the 
results indicate that 46 isolates were able to develop even at a concentration 
of 5 µg/mL of Dif (the suggested discriminatory dose), indicating reduced 
sensitivity to this fungicide. The analysis of the values of the effective 
concentration to inhibit 50% (EC50) of mycelial growth of P. expansum ranging 
from 0.027 to 1.673 µg/mL (mean: 0.263 µg/mL, variation factor: 62.507) and for 
spore germination from 0.0002 to 0.787 µg/mL (mean: 0.048 µg/mL, variation 
factor: 4113.835). The wide variation in EC50 values indicates significant 
variability in the isolates' responses to Dif, likely due to diverse sampling in 
space and time. Our results showed that some P. expansum isolates could grow 
even at high concentrations of Dif, indicating limited efficacy of this 
treatment. The EC50 of five isolates exceeded 0.92 µg/mL, suggesting potential 
resistance. This study indicates reduced sensitivity and possible emergence of 
resistant strains. Notably, it is the first evaluation of P. expansum 
sensitivity to Dif in Morocco.

Understanding the intricate dynamics of fish microbiota through 16S rRNA 
amplicon sequencing is pivotal for ecological insights and effective disease 
management. However, this approach faces challenges including the 
co-amplification of host mitochondrial sequences and the variability in 
bacterial composition influenced by the selected 16S rRNA gene regions. To 
overcome these limitations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation to 
identify the most suitable 16S rRNA region for bacterial microbial analysis in 
endangered fish Totoaba macdonaldi, an endemic species of significant ecological 
and economic importance in Mexico. Targeting four distinct hypervariable regions 
(V1-V2, V2-V3, V3-V4, and V5-V7) of the 16S rRNA gene, we determined the 
microbial composition within the distal intestine. A total of 40 microbiomes 
were sequenced. Our findings underscore the critical impact of region selection 
on the accuracy of microbiota analysis. The V3-V4 region detected the highest 
number of bacterial taxa and exhibited significantly higher alpha diversity 
indices, demonstrating the highest taxonomic resolution. This study emphasizes 
the necessity of meticulous 16S rRNA region selection for fish microbiota 
analysis, particularly in native species of ecological and economic significance 
such as the endangered T. macdonaldi, where information is limited. Such 
optimization enhances the reliability and applicability of microbiota studies in 
fisheries management and conservation efforts.

Although a lack of diversity in genetic studies is an acknowledged obstacle for 
personalized medicine and precision public health, Latin American populations 
remain particularly understudied despite their heterogeneity and mixed ancestry. 
This gap extends to COVID-19 despite its variability in susceptibility and 
clinical course, where ethnic background appears to influence disease severity, 
with non-Europeans facing higher hospitalization rates. In addition, access to 
high-quality samples and data is a critical issue for personalized and precision 
medicine, and it has become clear that the solution lies in biobanks. The 
creation of the Chilean COVID-19 Biorepository reported here addresses these 
gaps, representing the first nationwide multicentric Chilean initiative. It 
operates under rigorous biobanking standards and serves as one of South 
America's largest COVID cohorts. A centralized harmonization strategy was chosen 
and included unified standard operating procedures, a sampling coding system, 
and biobanking staff training. Adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
provided broad informed consent. Samples were collected to preserve blood, 
plasma, buffy coat, and DNA. Quality controls included adherence to the standard 
preanalytical code, incident reporting, and DNA concentration and absorbance 
ratio 260/280 assessments. Detailed sociodemographic, health, medication, and 
preexisting condition data were gathered. In five months, 2262 participants were 
enrolled, pseudonymized, and sorted by disease severity. The average Amerindian 
ancestry considering all participant was 44.0% [SD 15.5%], and this value 
increased to 61.2% [SD 19.5%] among those who self-identified as Native South 
Americans. Notably, 279 participants self-identified with one of 12 ethnic 
groups. High compliance (>90%) in all assessed quality controls was achieved. 
Looking ahead, our team founded the COVID-19 Genomics Network (C19-GenoNet) 
focused on identifying genetic factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. In 
conclusion, this bottom-up collaborative effort aims to promote the integration 
of Latin American populations into global genetic research and welcomes 
collaborations supporting this endeavor. Interested parties are invited to 
explore collaboration opportunities through our catalog, accessible online.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disease, influenced by 
dietary and environmental factors that can modify the intestinal microbiota. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the composition and diversity of 
the intestinal microbiota associated with carbohydrate (CHO) consumption in T2DM 
patients. Forty patients participated, with and without T2DM. Fecal samples were 
collected for the characterization of microbial diversity from the massive 
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Carbohydrate consumption was quantified using 
the Frequency Consumption Foods questionnaire (FCF), the groups were categorized 
according to Body Mass Index (BMI) and BMI + CHO consumption. The group without 
T2DM showed normal biochemical and anthropometric parameters, although they had 
a high carbohydrate consumption compared to the group with T2DM. At the phylum 
level, there were differences in relative abundance; the control overweight 
group (CL-OW > CHO) and T2DM-Normal Weight > CHO patients had increased 
Bacteroides and decreased Firmicutes. In contrast, the CL-OW > CHO and T2DM-OW < 
CHO patients, showed reduced Bacteroidetes and an elevated amount of Firmicutes. 
At the genus level, the differences were in the relative abundance of Roseburia, 
Clostridium_IV, Prevotella, and Sporobacter, associated with the consumption of 
carbohydrates. The groups that consumed high amounts of carbohydrates, 
regardless of whether they had diabetes mellitus or were overweight, had a 
significantly reduced proportion of Faecalibacterium, an altered proportion of 
Bacteroides. The high consumption of carbohydrates showed considerable 
modifications in the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities.

Obesity, a global public health problem, is constantly increasing, so the 
concerns in preventing and combating it are increasingly focused on the 
intestinal microbiota. It was found that the microbiota is different in lean 
people compared to obese individuals, but the exact mechanisms by which energy 
homeostasis is influenced are still incompletely known. Numerous studies show 
the involvement of certain bacterial species in promoting obesity and associated 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc. Our aim is to summarize 
the main findings regarding the influence of several factors such as lifestyle 
changes, including diet and bariatric surgery, on the diversity of the gut 
microbiota in obese individuals. The second purpose of this paper is to 
investigate the potential effect of various microbiota modulation techniques on 
ameliorating obesity and its comorbidities. A literature search was conducted 
using the PubMed database, identifying articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
Most studies identified suggest that obesity is generally associated with 
alterations of the gut microbiome such as decreased microbial diversity, an 
increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased SCFAs levels. Our 
findings also indicate that gut microbiota modulation techniques could represent 
a novel strategy in treating obesity and related metabolic diseases. Although 
some mechanisms (e.g., inflammation or hormonal regulation) are already 
considered a powerful connection between gut microbiota and obesity development, 
further research is needed to enhance the knowledge on this particular topic.

The gut microbiota, a diverse collection of microorganisms in the 
gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role in regulating metabolic, immune, 
and cognitive functions. Disruptions in the composition of these microbial 
communities, termed dysbiosis, have been linked to various neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDs), such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
One of the key pathological features of NDs is neuroinflammation, which involves 
the activation of microglia and peripheral immune cells. The gut microbiota 
modulates immune responses through the production of metabolites and 
interactions with immune cells, influencing the inflammatory processes within 
the central nervous system. This review explores the impact of gut dysbiosis on 
neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, immune cells, and 
potential therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota to alleviate 
neuroinflammatory processes in NDs.

Background. In many studies over the past decade, scientists have made a 
connection between the composition of gut microbiota and human health. A number 
of publications have shown that gut bacteria are involved in many metabolic and 
physiological processes of the organism. The composition of the gut microbiome 
is unique for each person and is formed under the influence of various factors 
associated with both the individual characteristics of the body and the 
characteristics of the environment. Different regional characteristics make it 
necessary for the body to adapt to certain conditions, including temperature 
fluctuations. Living in areas with low temperatures, such as the Arctic zone, 
dictates the need for increased energy consumption, which affects the 
composition of the gut microbiome. Methods. In our study, an extensive 
questionnaire was conducted among the participants, where many questions were 
included about the dietary preferences of the study participants, which allowed 
them us to further divide them into groups according to their diets. Stool 
samples were collected from participants from 3 groups: Arctic native, Arctic 
newcomer and the control group. The next step was the isolation of bacterial DNA 
and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The analysis of the results of the diversity 
of the intestinal microbiota was carried out both with and without taking into 
account the dietary preferences of the participants. Results. As a result of 
comparing the intestinal microbiota obtained from residents of the Arctic zone 
with the gut microbiota of residents of other regions with a milder climate, 
significant differences are found. These differences may be related to limited 
food resources and a reduction in the variety of food products characteristic of 
this Arctic region. t was also found that representatives of the bacterial 
families Christensenellaceae and Muribaculaceae dominated the control group, 
both with traditional nutrition and with a dairy-free diet in comparison with 
the Arctic groups. The control group was dominated by representatives of the 
Prevotellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae families compared to the 
Arctic group (with a traditional diet). The results also show that the number of 
representatives of the families Desulfovibrionaceae (with traditional diet) and 
Enterobacteriaceae (with milk-free diet) is growing in the Arctic group. 
Conclusions. In the course of this work, bacterial families characteristic of 
people living in the Arc-tic zone of the Far Eastern region of the Russian 
Federation were identified. Poor diet, difficult climatic conditions, and 
problems with logistics and medical care can have a strong impact on the health 
of this population. The main type of diet for the inhabitants of the Arctic is 
the traditional type of diet. They consume a large number of low-cost products, 
obtainget animal protein from poultry and canned food, and also eat a small 
number of fresh vegetables and fruits. Such a diet is due to the social status 
of the study participants and the climatic and geographical features of the 
region (difficulties in agriculture). With such a diet, we observe a decrease in 
representatives of the Christensenellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Eubacteriaceae, and 
Prevotellaceae families and an increase in representatives of the 
Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae families among Arctic residents. This 
imbalance in the futuremay cause, this population may to develop various 
diseases in the future, including chronic diseases such as obesity, intestinal 
dysbiosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: The preservation of soil health is a critical challenge in the 21st 
century due to its significant impact on agriculture, human health, and 
biodiversity. We provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into the 
predictive potential of machine learning models for understanding the 
connections between soil and biological phenotypes. We investigate an 
integrative framework performing accurate machine learning-based prediction of 
plant performance from biological, chemical, and physical properties of the soil 
via two models: random forest and Bayesian neural network.
RESULTS: Prediction improves when we add environmental features, such as soil 
properties and microbial density, along with microbiome data. Different 
preprocessing strategies show that human decisions significantly impact 
predictive performance. We show that the naive total sum scaling normalization 
that is commonly used in microbiome research is one of the optimal strategies to 
maximize predictive power. Also, we find that accurately defined labels are more 
important than normalization, taxonomic level, or model characteristics. ML 
performance is limited when humans can't classify samples accurately. Lastly, we 
provide domain scientists via a full model selection decision tree to identify 
the human choices that optimize model prediction power.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of incorporating diverse 
environmental features and careful data preprocessing in enhancing the 
predictive power of machine learning models for soil and biological phenotype 
connections. This approach can significantly contribute to advancing 
agricultural practices and soil health management.

Food workers have frequent contact with unprocessed foods, but their carriage of 
Salmonella and potential influence on public health have not been 
comprehensively assessed. We investigated Salmonella carriage among food workers 
compared with non-food workers based on occupational health screening of 260,315 
asymptomatic workers over an 8-year surveillance period in Yulin, China. We 
confirmed that healthy carriers serve as natural reservoirs for Salmonella, with 
higher carriage rates in food workers than non-food workers. The isolates from 
food workers also exhibited greater serovar diversity and likely higher levels 
of antimicrobial resistance than those from non-food workers. Factors such as 
meteorological, social, and hygiene factors potentially influenced the carriage 
rate. Genomic analysis revealed a consistent increase in antimicrobial 
resistance genes among Salmonella isolates over the study period, with the 
majority of these antimicrobial resistance genes located on plasmids. 
Additionally, we identified numerous closely related bacterial clusters, which 
might reflect clusters of hidden local foodborne infections. This study 
underscores the elevated risk posed by food workers in the persistence and 
dissemination of Salmonella as vectors/fomites. Enhanced monitoring and targeted 
interventions in this group may reduce the dissemination of pathogens and 
antimicrobial resistance genes.

Spider venoms are emerging as a rich source of bioactive peptide toxins with 
therapeutic potential. Lynx spiders of the genus Oxyopes are small, cursorial 
hunters that employ complex venom to subdue arthropod prey. However, extracting 
crude venom from these diminutive arachnids poses significant challenges. This 
study presents a transcriptome analysis of venom glands from an undescribed 
Oxyopes forcipiformis species, revealing 339 putative protein and peptide toxin 
sequences categorized into seven functional groups. The venom composition was 
dominated by membrane-active peptides (40.71%), venom auxiliary proteins 
(22.71%), neurotoxins (15.63%), channel active peptides (7.08%) and 
uncharacterized components (13.87%). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of 65 
disulfide-bond-rich peptides yielded six distinct families based on sequence 
homology and cysteine framework. Finally, a novel antimicrobial peptide, GK37, 
was identified using in silico and homology analyses. Our data suggested that 
GK37 presented significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria 
Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.552 µM 
by disrupting bacterial membranes. At 4× MICs, GK37 almost showed no hemolytic 
activity on blood cells or toxicity against Hek293T cells. Our findings provided 
a basis for targeted studies of the diversity and pharmacological effects of 
lynx spider peptide. We elucidated a valuable high-throughput approach for 
obtaining proteins and peptides from small-group spiders.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which comprise coronary heart disease, 
hypertension, and stroke, collectively represent the number one cause of death 
globally. Atherosclerosis is the dominant cause of CVDs, and its risk factors 
are elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, 
hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, 
diverse evidence highlights the role played by inflammation and clonal 
haematopoiesis, eventually leading to immunity involvement. The human microbiota 
project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have 
indicated that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human 
gut. Disturbances in the gut microbiota (GM) composition, i.e., gut dysbiosis, 
have been associated with diseases ranging from localised gastrointestinal 
disorders to metabolic and cardiovascular illnesses. Of note, experimental 
studies suggested that GM, host immune cells, and marine-derived ingredients 
work together to ensure intestinal wall integrity. This review discusses current 
evidence concerning the links among GM, marine-derived ingredients, and human 
inflammatory disease. In detail, we summarise the impact of fish-derived 
proteins/peptides and algae components on CVD risk factors and gut microbiome. 
Furthermore, we describe the interplay among these dietary components, 
probiotics/prebiotics, and CVDs.

Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium dahliae Kleb. is a lethal soil-borne 
fungal disease of Cotinus coggygria. The plant endophytic microbiome plays an 
important role in maintaining plant health and disease resistance, but it is 
unclear how the endophytic microbiome of C. coggygria roots varies in response 
to Verticillium wilt occurrence. In this study, the endophytic microbial 
diversity, community composition, dominant species, and co-occurrence network of 
C. coggygria under Verticillium wilt-affected and healthy conditions were 
assessed using Illumina sequencing. Compared with healthy plants, the bacterial 
alpha diversity indices of Verticillium wilt-affected plants decreased 
significantly, while the fungal alpha diversity indices showed obvious 
increases. The relative abundance of dominant taxa including Proteobacteria, 
Actinobacteriota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota at the phylum level, as well as 
Gammaproteobacteria, Thermoleophilia, Dothideomycetes, and Agaricomycetes at the 
class level, differed significantly between Verticillium wilt-affected and 
healthy plants. Co-occurrence networks revealed that the fungal network of 
Verticillium wilt-affected roots was denser with more negative interactions, 
which may be relevant to functional changes from reciprocity to competition in 
the microbial community, in response to V. dahliae infection. The results 
enhanced our understanding on the relationships between the endophytic 
microbiome and Verticillium wilt, which could provide information for the 
management of this disease in C. coggygria.

Banana is an important fruit and food crop in tropical and subtropical regions 
worldwide. Banana production is seriously threatened by Fusarium wilt of banana 
(FWB), a disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, and biological 
control is an important means of curbing this soil-borne disease. To reveal the 
effects of biocontrol agents on inhibiting FWB and altering the soil bacterial 
community under natural ecosystems, we conducted experiments at a banana 
plantation. The control efficiency of a compound microbial agent (CM), 
Paenibacillus polymyxa (PP), Trichoderma harzianum (TH), and carbendazim (CA) on 
this disease were compared in the field. Meanwhile, the alterations in structure 
and function of the rooted soil bacterial community in different treatments 
during the vigorous growth and fruit development stages of banana were analyzed 
by microbiomics method. The results confirmed that the different biocontrol 
agents could effectively control FWB. In particular, CM significantly reduced 
the incidence of the disease and showed a field control efficiency of 60.53%. In 
terms of bacterial community, there were no significant differences in the 
richness and diversity of banana rooted soil bacteria among the different 
treatments at either growth stage, but their relative abundances differed 
substantially. CM treatment significantly increased the ratios of Bacillus, 
Bryobacter, Pseudomonas, Jatrophihabitans, Hathewaya, and Chujaibacter in the 
vigorous growth stage and Jatrophihabitans, Occallatibacter, Cupriavidus, and 
1921-3 in the fruit development stage. Furthermore, bacterial community function 
in the banana rooted soil was affected differently by the various biocontrol 
agents. CM application increased the relative abundance of multiple soil 
bacterial functions, including carbohydrate metabolism, xenobiotic 
biodegradation and metabolism, terpenoid and polyketide metabolism, lipid 
metabolism, and metabolism of other amino acids. In summary, our results suggest 
that the tested biocontrol agents can effectively inhibit the occurrence of 
banana Fusarium wilt and alter the soil bacterial community in the field. They 
mainly modified the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and the metabolic 
functions rather than the richness and diversity. These findings provide a 
scientific basis for the use of biocontrol agents to control banana Fusarium 
wilt under field conditions, which serves as a reference for the study of the 
soil microbiological mechanisms of other biocontrol agents.

Pleosporales represents the largest order within the class Dothideomycetes 
(Fungi), comprising phytopathogenic, saprobic, and endophytic taxa with a 
widespread presence in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Rice (Oryza sativa) 
is a primary economic crop in numerous tropical countries, particularly in 
Thailand. Studying fungal species associated with rice holds the potential to 
enhance our understanding of fungal diversity, lifestyles, and biology of rice, 
offering valuable insights for future research aimed at disease management and 
yield improvement. Thirty-nine pleosporalean isolates were obtained from various 
parts of rice plants collected across diverse regions in Chiang Rai Province, 
Thailand. Species identification involved a combination of morphology and 
molecular phylogeny, utilizing multi-locus sequence analyses of the ITS, LSU, 
SSU, gapdh, rpb2, tef1, and tub2 genes. The isolates were identified in 18 taxa 
distributed across five families and ten genera, including five new species 
(Bipolaris chiangraiensis, Ophiosphaerella oryzae, Paraphaeosphaeria oryzae, 
Pyrenochaetopsis oryzicola, and Setophoma oryzicola). Additionally, six new host 
records and two new geographical records are documented. Photoplates, detailed 
morphological descriptions, and phylogenetic trees are provided to elucidate the 
placement of both known and novel taxa.

Pest cockroaches share urban habitats with us; their prevalence in urban areas 
prompts concerns regarding their effect on human health, as synanthropic 
cockroaches often host pathogenic microorganisms. Nonetheless, microbial 
associates in these insects can also be related to their biology, contributing 
to their physiological homeostasis and reproductive success. In this article, we 
present in detail, for the first time, the bacterial community associated with 
the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis, one of the world's five most prominent 
pest cockroaches. We report the composition of the communities of bacteria found 
over the exoskeleton and inside the gut of this global pest. We collected B. 
orientalis in Santiago, Chile's capital city, and the urban nucleus in this 
country. We conducted DNA extractions and metabarcoding analysis. We found 
diverse bacterial lineages, including mutualist symbiotic strains, and 
microorganisms considered pathogenic to humans. We also analyzed the metabolic 
functions of the bacterial communities identified and discussed the role of B. 
orientalis as a reservoir and vector of pathogens in urban areas. We discuss to 
what extent the diversity of functions of the microbial community associated 
with cockroaches may contribute to emergent properties enabling these insects to 
inhabit human-modified habitats.

INTRODUCTION: Fusarium-induced root rot of Carya cathayensis (C. cathayensis) is 
a typical soil-borne disease that has severely damaged the Carya cathayensis 
industry in China. Understanding the interaction among soil microbial 
communities, soil characteristics, and pathogenic bacteria is very important for 
the ecological prevention and control of Carya cathayensis root rot.
METHODS: We used Miseq Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology to study 
the microbial community in the rhizosphere soil of healthy and diseased C. 
cathayensis, quantified the abundance of bacteria, fungi, and pathogenic fungi, 
and combined these with soil chemistry and enzyme activity indicators to analyze 
the characteristics of healthy and diseased rhizosphere soils.
RESULTS: We found that the pH, soil organic carbon(SOC), available nitrogen 
(AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium 
(AK),N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) β-glucosidase (BG), fungal gene copy 
number, bacterial community diversity and network complexity of the diseased 
soil were significantly lower (p < 0.05), while Fusarium graminearum copies 
number levels increased (p < 0.05). Additionally, the study found that healthy 
soils were enriched with beneficial bacteria such as Subgroup_7 (0.08%), MND1 
(0.29%), SWB02 (0.08%), and Bradyrhizobium (0.09%), as well as potential 
pathogen-suppressing fungi such as Mortierella (0.13%), Preussia (0.03%), and 
Humicol (0.37%), were found to be associated with the growth and development of 
C. cathayensis.
DISCUSSION: In summary, this research comprehensively reveals the differences in 
environmental and biological factors between healthy and diseased soils, as well 
as their correlations. It provides a theoretical basis for optimal soil 
environmental regulation and the construction of healthy microbial communities. 
This foundation facilitates the development of multifaceted strategies for the 
prevention and control of C. cathayensis root rot.

Cow's milk allergy (CMA) remains one of the most common and complex paediatric 
food allergies. In the last decade, our understanding has advanced in terms of 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated CMA and focus is now also paid to 
non-IgE-mediated CMA, particularly in some Western countries where incidence 
rates are high. We have had significant progress in the last 10 years in 
relation to our understanding of existing supportive tests for IgE-mediated CMA, 
with the advancement of newer tests, such as the basophil activation test (BAT), 
which have shown great promise. However, little advancement has been made in 
terms of tests for non-IgE-mediated CMA, and controversy still exists around 
symptoms. Our understanding of the natural history of CMA has also advanced with 
more awareness of different phenotypes. While the mainstay of management remains 
cow's milk elimination, the importance of supporting breastfeeding and avoidance 
of unwarranted cow's milk elimination diets in breastfeeding mothers has been 
highlighted. For non-breastfed children, there has been some advancement in the 
formulas offered for the management of CMA, including the recognition of 
hydrolysed rice-based formulas and increased demand for nutritionally complete 
plant-based options, some of which are currently being assessed. The addition of 
pro, pre and synbiotics is considered safe to use, although research and 
guidance on routine use remain absent. Knowledge of tolerance induction from 
studies on the early introduction of peanuts has also highlighted the importance 
of a more active approach to managing CMA with the use of milk ladders, 
primarily in non-IgE-mediated CMA and baked milk (BM) introduction in 
IgE-mediated CMA. In addition, modulation of the microbiome and diet diversity 
during complementary feeding has been a major advancement in the last 10 years. 
While data on poor growth and feeding difficulties in children with CMA has not 
changed much, increased rates of obesity are now also reported. Finally, novel 
approaches, including oral immunotherapy, the use of milk ladders and earlier 
consideration of BM, have advanced somewhat in the last decade, although the 
risks and benefits of these novel approaches require further research. While CMA 
remains a complicated allergy to diagnose and manage, the evolution of science 
has advanced our knowledge and brought some novel innovations, which combined 
have enhanced our practice.

Recent studies have identified a critical role of the diverse and dynamic 
microbiome in modulating various aspects of host physiology and intrinsic 
processes. However, the altered microbiome has also become a hallmark of cancer, 
which could influence the tumor microenvironment. Aberrations in epigenetic 
regulation of tumor suppressors, apoptotic genes, and oncogenes can accentuate 
breast cancer onset and progression. Interestingly, recent studies have 
established that the microbiota modulates the epigenetic mechanisms at global 
and gene-specific levels. While the mechanistic basis is unclear, the cross-talk 
between the microbiome and epigenetics influences breast cancer trajectory. 
Here, we review different epigenetic mechanisms of mammalian gene expression and 
summarize the host-associated microbiota distributed across the human body and 
their influence on cancer and other disease-related genes. Understanding this 
complex relationship between epigenetics and the microbiome holds promise for 
new insights into effective therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.

Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells is one of the most difficult 
problems in all of biology. A key challenge relevant to the question of 
eukaryogenesis is reconstructing the gene repertoire of the last eukaryotic 
common ancestor (LECA). As data sets grow, sketching an accurate 
genomics-informed picture of early eukaryotic cellular complexity requires 
provision of analytical resources and a commitment to data sharing. Here, we 
summarise progress towards understanding the biology of LECA and outline a 
community approach to inferring its wider gene repertoire. Once assembled, a 
robust LECA gene set will be a useful tool for evaluating alternative hypotheses 
about the origin of eukaryotes and understanding the evolution of traits in all 
descendant lineages, with relevance in diverse fields such as cell biology, 
microbial ecology, biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. In this Consensus 
View, we put forth the status quo and an agreed path forward to reconstruct 
LECA's gene content.

Ethanol can directly or indirectly lead to cognitive and mental disorders. The 
long-term intake of alcohol can directly affect the distribution of gut 
microbiota. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a natural bacterium isolated 
from healthy human intestines that has the function of preventing 
cytokine-induced cell apoptosis and protecting cell barriers. However, the 
regulatory effect of LGG on cognitive and mental disorders caused by chronic 
ethanol exposure (CEE) is still unclear. In this study, we established a CEE 
mouse model through free alcohol consumption and added LGG or antibiotics in the 
later stages of the model. Sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that 
CEE resulted in a decrease in the abundance and diversity of mouse gut microbial 
communities accompanied by alterations in the relative abundance of multiple 
enterobacterial genera. The use of LGG and antibiotics alleviated the 
depression-like behaviour and cognitive impairment of CEE-induced mice, reduced 
expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the ileum, serum and brain and increased the 
expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Together, LGG can 
alleviate depression-like behaviour caused by CEE in mice while also improving 
cognitive and memory functions through reducing peripheral and nervous system 
inflammation factors and balancing gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Over the past years, there has been a significant increase in the 
incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infections, particularly among pediatric 
patients, nationwide. An emerging body of research has established a link 
between dysbiosis of the host microbiome and the metabolic functioning of the 
host, which contributes to the development of respiratory diseases.
METHODS: A total of 25 children were included in the study, comprising 15 
pneumonia patients and 10 healthy children. Stool samples were collected from 
all participants to analyze the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, while serum 
samples were prepared for untargeted metabolomics to qualitatively and 
quantitatively assess short-chain fatty acids.
RESULTS: The gut microbial composition of individuals with Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
pneumonia (MPP) exhibited significant differences compared to healthy children. 
Notably, diseased children demonstrated higher microbial diversity and an 
enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, such as Erysipelatoclostridium and 
Eggerthella. Analysis revealed elevated levels of two specific short-chain fatty 
acids, namely acetic acid and isobutyric acid, in the MPP group, suggesting 
their potential as biomarkers for predicting MP infection. Metabolomic signature 
analysis identified a significant increase in major classes of 
glycerophospholipids in the MPP group. Moreover, we identified a total of 750 
significant correlations between gut microbiota and circulating serum 
metabolites. MPP enriched genera Erysipelatoclostridium and Eggerthella, 
exhibited negative associations with indole-3-butyric acid. Additionally, 
Eggerthella showed a positive correlation with inflammatory metabolites LPC 
(18:0).
DISCUSSION: Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the 
selection of potential biomarkers and the pathogenesis of MPP in children based 
on the gut microbiota and systemic circulating metabolites.

Pilots, Astronauts, and the Aerospace Microbiota: A Narrative Review of 
Occupational Impact.

The human microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health and preventing 
disease; however, the effects of occupational exposure on the microbiota of 
aircrew and astronauts are not fully understood. This narrative review aims to 
synthesize the current knowledge on microbiota alterations in aerospace 
medicine, assess the potential of probiotics as a countermeasure, and identify 
key gaps that warrant further research. The references were identified through 
searching PubMed for English articles published between 2010 and 2024, using 
keywords related to microbiota, probiotics, aviation, spaceflight, pilots, and 
astronauts. Additionally, the bibliographies of relevant papers were reviewed. 
Studies in aerospace medicine were selected based on their focus on the 
occupational impact on microbiota and the use of probiotics in this context. For 
aircrew, initial studies indicate a decrease in beneficial gut bacteria, 
suggesting that probiotics could enhance gastrointestinal health, immunity, and 
overall well-being. However, unsupervised use of probiotics carries potential 
risks. Conversely, spaceflight induces significant changes in the gut, skin, 
oral, and nasal microbiota of astronauts, characterized by altered diversity and 
abundance of specific microbial taxa. These changes include a relative decrease 
in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, an increase in opportunistic 
pathogens, and evidence of microbial transfer between astronauts and spacecraft 
surfaces. While simulated space studies suggest the potential for probiotics to 
mitigate dysbiosis, direct testing done during actual spaceflight is lacking. 
The observed microbiota changes during spaceflight are associated with various 
health implications, including alterations in metabolic pathways and 
interactions between the microbial metabolic capabilities and the host's 
metabolism. In conclusion, this review highlights the profound impact of 
spaceflight on astronaut microbiota and the promising role of probiotics as an 
intervention in both space and aviation medicine. However, significant research 
gaps remain. These include elucidating the functional implications of microbial 
shifts, developing personalized countermeasures, and validating the efficacy of 
probiotics during spaceflight. Future studies should leverage advanced tools 
such as metagenomic analysis and longitudinal tracking of astronaut health to 
inform targeted interventions that support the well-being of aerospace 
personnel. Integrating data across different sites of the body and missions, 
facilitated by resources like the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), can help 
identify consistent microbial changes induced by the unique occupational 
conditions of spaceflight and aviation. This integrated approach will be crucial 
for developing effective microbiota-based countermeasures to mitigate the 
occupational health risks associated with space and aviation.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex chronic inflammatory 
condition characterized by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and dysregulation of 
immune system. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from 
mesenchymal stem cells have garnered significant attention for their beneficial 
potentials in immune modulation and tissue repair. This study aims to evaluate 
the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of EVs derived from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-pretreated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in 
mice with colitis.
METHODS: A mouse model of colitis was established using 3.0% dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS). Following the induction of colitis, mice were treated via tail 
vein injection with either conventional PDLSC-derived EVs (P-EVs) or 
LPS-pretreated PDLSC-derived EVs (LPS pre-EVs). The EVs were characterized using 
transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western 
blot analysis. The therapeutic effects and mechanisms were evaluated through a 
combination of small animal live imaging, disease activity index (DAI) scoring, 
histopathological staining, qRT-PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and mass 
spectrometry analysis.
RESULTS: The LPS pre-EVs exhibited typical EVs characteristics in terms of 
morphology, particle size distribution, and marker protein expression. Compared 
to P-EVs, LPS pre-EVs significantly ameliorated weight loss, DAI scores, colon 
length, and perianal symptoms in DSS-induced murine colitis. Additionally, LPS 
pre-EVs up-regulated the expression of Arginase-1, a typical M2 macrophage 
marker, and tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1, 
enhanced gut microbial diversity, and significantly regulated intestinal protein 
expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: LPS pre-EVs exhibit significant anti-inflammatory and tissue repair 
effects in a mouse model of colitis. The underlying mechanisms may involve the 
regulation of macrophage polarization, maintenance of intestinal barrier 
function, modulation of the gut microbiota, and activation of the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in understanding the association between 
the gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Natural compounds, such 
as Korean Red Ginseng (KRG), show promise for IBD treatment because of their 
ability to influence gut microbiota. This study explored the effects of KRG on 
gut microbiota modulation and subsequent intestinal epithelial cell regeneration 
in an experimental colitis model.
METHOD: Using a mouse model of colitis induced by 2 % dextran sodium sulfate, 
the study administered 200 or 400 mg/kg/day of KRG to evaluate its biological 
effects. Colitis symptoms were assessed through body weight, disease activity 
index, colon length, and histological analysis. The microbial composition in the 
fecal was determined using 16S rRNA sequencing. To evaluate regeneration signals 
in the colon, western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays were conducted.
RESULT: Administration of KRG effectively mitigated colitis symptoms in mice, as 
indicated by histological examination showing alleviated epithelial damage and 
inflammation, along with increased mucus production. Microbiota analysis showed 
that KRG significantly altered microbial diversity, favoring beneficial taxa and 
suppressing harmful taxa. Moreover, ameliorated β-catenin/transcription factor-4 
protein expression, a key signal associated with epithelial cell regeneration, 
was observed in the KRG treated groups, accompanied by improved intestinal 
linings.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that KRG exerts biological effects in colitis 
by modulating gut microbiota and creating a favorable intestinal environment, 
thereby reducing regenerative signals. Further research is warranted to 
elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of 
KRG with gut microbiota and pave the way for effective IBD therapies.

Microbiome is a highly complex and diverse symbiotic component that undergoes 
dynamic changes with the organismal aging. Microbial perturbations, termed 
dysbiosis, exert strong influence on dysregulating the bone marrow niche and 
subsequently promoting the aging of hematopoietic and immune system. Besides, 
accumulating studies have revealed the substantial impact of intestinal 
microbiome on the initiation and progression of age-related hematologic 
alteration and diseases, such as clonal hematopoiesis and blood cancers. Current 
therapeutic approaches to restore the altered microbiome diversity target 
specific pathobionts and are demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes of 
anti-hematologic malignancy treatments. In this review, we discuss the interplay 
between the microbiome and the hemato-immune system during aging process. We 
also shed light on the emerging therapeutic strategies to tackle the dysbiosis 
for amelioration of aging and disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: The oral microbiome plays an important role in the development and 
progression of periodontal disease. The purpose of this study was to compare 
microbial profiles of oral cavities in good health, with gingivitis, and in a 
state of periodontitis, and to identify novel pathogens involved in periodontal 
diseases.
METHODS: One hundred and two participants, including 33 healthy controls, 41 
patients with gingivitis, and 28 patients with periodontitis, were included in 
this cross-sectional study. Salivary oral microbiomes were investigated using 
16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing, and the microbial profiles of each group were 
compared using age- and sex-adjusted general linear models.
RESULTS: The abundance of amplicon sequence variants and Chao1 diversity were 
significantly elevated in the gingivitis and periodontitis groups relative to 
healthy controls (p = 0.046). Based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores 
(>2), Tenericutes, Mollicutes, Mycoplasmatales, Mycoplasmataceae, Mycoplasma, 
Bacteroidaceae, and Phocaeicola were significantly enriched in the gingivitis 
group, and Synergistetes, Synergistia, Synergistales, Synergistaceae, 
Fretibacterium, Sinanaerobacter, and Filifactor were enriched in the 
periodontitis group. The relative abundances of Fretibacterium fastidiosum, 
Sinanaerobacter chloroacetimidivorans, and Filifactor alocis (q = 0.008, all 
bacteria) were highest in the periodontitis group and lowest in the control 
group. The relative abundance of Treponema denticola was significantly elevated 
in the periodontitis group compared to the other two groups (q = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Oral microbiomes differed between groups. T. denticola, F. 
fastidiosum, S. chloroacetimidivorans and F. alocis were significantly more 
abundant in the periodontitis group than in the control group. Additionally, the 
abundance of T. denticola and F. fastidiosum in the periodontitis group was 
significantly different from that in the gingivitis group.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. The 
development of prophylactic vaccine is essential for HCV global eradication. 
Despite over three decades of research, no effective vaccine for HCV has been 
developed, primarily due to the virus's genetic diversity, immune evasion 
mechanisms, and incomplete understanding of protective immunity. However, 
Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) offer a promising approach to overcoming these 
challenges. VLPs mimic the structure of native virus but without the infectious 
genome, making them safe and non-infectious vaccines candidates. The capability 
of VLPs to incorporate neutralizing and conformational epitopes, and engage 
humoral and cellular immune responses, positions them as a promising tool for 
overcoming challenges associated with the HCV vaccine development. This review 
examines the challenges and immunological considerations for HCV vaccine 
development and provides an overview of the VLPs-based vaccines development. It 
also discusses future directions and public health implications of HCV vaccine 
development.

Recently, the microbiome has been gaining significant attention in the 
healthcare sector as a next-generation factor. However, there remains a 
substantial gap in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of microbes, 
particularly regarding the effector microbial products exchanged between the 
microbiota and the host. Consequently, research on microbial extracellular 
vesicles (MEVs) has increased. MEVs, which are nano-sized, can circulate 
throughout the body and penetrate the bloodstream, carrying diverse information. 
Consequently, they are increasingly being utilized in medical applications. 
Additionally, AI technologies are being utilized in medicine. The combination of 
MEVs and AI technology is being explored for the development of algorithm-based 
in vitro diagnostics (IVD). Therefore, this study aims to review the integration 
of MEVs and AI technology as diagnostic tools for personalized medicine. This 
paper reviewed the MEV-based algorithms developed by a variety of human samples 
and AI technology. Additionally, most of MEV-based diagnostic models showed 
higher clinical performance. Several important factors are crucial for accurate 
diagnosis. First, optimizing sample types according to specific diseases is 
essential. Second, AI technology with higher diagnostic power yields more 
accurate results. Finally, incorporating additional markers can enhance 
diagnostic power. However, applying this tool in situ faces several limitations, 
including method standardization, sample size, and analysis techniques. In the 
future, we anticipate that research on MEVs will advance our understanding of 
their role in disease and establish the foundation for precision medicine 
strategies.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Soil microorganisms that are closely related to 
plants are important factors affecting plant health. Therefore, elucidating the 
abundant and rare bacterial species in soil associated with plant diseases is 
crucial for understanding ecological processes, maintaining the stability of 
microecological environments, and formulating microbial strategies that are 
consistent with modern agricultural development.
RESULTS: Tea leaf blight leads to an increase in bacterial diversity in the 
rhizosphere. Random processes dominate the assembly of abundant and rare taxa, 
while abundant taxa are also influenced by deterministic processes. In the 
co-occurrence network, the increase in bacterial community diversity mediated by 
tea cloud leaf blight enhances the stability of the network. Meanwhile, the 
proportion of positive correlation between rare taxa is relatively high, and the 
relationship between rare taxa and intermediate taxa is closer. This highly 
diverse bacteria community maintained the structure and stability of the 
community to a certain extent.
CONCLUSION: The rare taxa in the rhizosphere and the rhizosphere bacterial 
community mediated by tea leaf blight have high diversity, which is of great 
significance for maintaining the stability of the rhizosphere bacterial 
ecological network. In the future, we will further explore the dynamic changes 
and interaction patterns of the species in the rhizosphere soil affected by tea 
tree diseases, and their ecological functions and importance in areas of habitat 
fragmentation. Overall, there are many microbial resources in the rhizosphere 
microbiota under the influence of plant diseases that can be used for 
agricultural practice. The results of this study will enrich the insights into 
ecodynamics of bacteria in karst areas, especially in karst tea gardens.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a fast-emerging global burden, is an 
umbrella term for several liver manifestations that result in excessive 
accumulation of fat in the liver. NAFLD leads to gut microbiome dysbiosis, loss 
in gut epithelia, increased gut permeability, etc. The limited availability of 
registered drugs for NAFLD highlights the urgent need to focus on understanding 
its pathogenesis and discovering new treatments, including the potential 
exploration of herbal therapies for managing the condition. In this study, we 
evaluated the bioactive potential of garcinol enriched fraction from Garcinia 
morella fruit rind in preventing NAFLD-associated increased gut permeability. 
Administration of garcinol-enriched fraction (GEF) significantly reduced body 
weight, serum lipids (triglyceride and total cholesterol) levels, and enzymes 
(alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase) responsible for liver 
dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. GEF treatment also 
regulated the alteration in signaling pathways of lipid metabolism in HFD-fed 
mice by inhibiting the overexpression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. 
Mice treated with GEF had increased gut microbial diversity, reduced pathogenic 
bacteria, and increased Lactococcus and Streptococcaceae genera. Additionally, 
GEF treatment could increase the expression of intestinal tight junction 
proteins, which were otherwise decreased in HFD-fed mice, stipulating its 
protective effect in maintaining gut barrier integrity. Our study demonstrated 
that GEF treatment reduces obesity in mice and improves gut health by keeping 
junctions tight and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome.

BACKGROUND: Polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is the most frequent 
photodermatosis in Europe with an estimated prevalence of 10 to 20%, 
particularly in temperate climates. Itching or burning lesions appear only in 
sun-exposed areas, predominantly on the chest, the arms and forearms within a 
few hours following exposure. The disease's cause is still unknown, yet studies 
have suggested that skin microbial elements may play a role in its pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated in this cohort the skin microbiome of PLE patients 
upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), to assess its role in the onset of 
PLE lesions.
METHODS: Forty-one skin swabs have been collected from eleven PLE patients at 
baseline and following a three-day exposure to UVR and from healthy controls. 
The collected swabs were analyzed for their microbial composition using a 16S 
amplicon sequencing approach.
RESULTS: The PLE skin showed a dysbalanced microbiome, already at baseline, with 
significantly reduced microbial diversity and noticeable colonization by 
bacterial pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus. Upon UVR exposure, the PLE 
microbiome exhibited a further loss of diversity and decline of beneficial skin 
commensals. In line with this, we observed that UVR exerted strong antimicrobial 
effects in vitro against representative skin residents.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, UVR can lead to profound skin microbiome changes, 
allowing the proliferation of dysbiotic members that can release a variety of 
elements able to trigger PLE lesions. This is the first study investigating the 
cutaneous microbiome changes in PLE patients upon UVR, offering new insights 
into disease pathogenesis, so far unexplored.

The quality of silage is uneven, which is due to the difference of epiphytic 
microorganisms of raw materials. To improve the quality of fermentation, the 
quantity and composition of epiphytic microorganisms are usually analyzed to 
better prepare silage. In this research, plate coating method and 16S 
high-throughput sequencing were used to analyze the differences in the quantity 
and composition of rice epiphytic microorganisms during different growth stages. 
The Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and aerobic bacteria were the highest at the 
flowering stage, the yeast was the highest at the milk ripening stage, and the 
mould was the highest at the full ripening stage. And the growth stage also had 
a great influence on the composition of epiphytic bacterial community, at the 
phylum level, it was mainly composed of Proteobacteria. And at the genus level, 
Pantoea, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Chryseobacterium were dominanted at the 
flowering stage; Pantoea, Stenotrophomonas and Sphingobacterium were dominanted 
at the milk ripening stage; Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Chryseobacterium and 
Lactococcus were dominanted at the dough stage; Acinetobacter and Klebsiella 
were dominated at the full ripening stage. Overall, the growth stage 
significantly affected the quantity and composition of rice epiphytic 
microorganisms. Therefore, rice silage can be modulated reasonably according to 
the number and composition of epiphytic microorganisms in different growth 
stages.

Composition and Function of the Gut Microbiome in Microscopic Colitis.

Chen AS, Kim H, Nzabarushimana E, Shen J, Williams K, Gurung J, McGoldrick J, 
Burke KE, Nguyen LH, Staller K, Chung DC, Xavier RJ, Khalili H.

BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, 
predominantly among older adults. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations 
of gut microbiome and metabolome may play an important role in MC pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively characterize alterations of the gut microbial and 
metabolic composition in MC.
DESIGN: We established a longitudinal cohort of adult patients with MC and two 
control groups of individuals - chronic diarrhea controls and age- and 
sex-matched controls without diarrhea. Using stool samples, gut microbiome was 
analyzed by whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and gut metabolome was 
profiled by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
Per-feature enrichment analyses of microbial species, metabolic pathways, and 
metabolites were done using multivariable linear models both cross-sectionally 
comparing MC to controls and longitudinally according to disease activity. 
Lastly, we performed multi-omics association analyses to assess the relationship 
between microbiome and metabolome data.
RESULTS: We included 683 participants, 131 with active MC (66 with both active 
and remission samples), 159 with chronic diarrhea, and 393 age- and sex-matched 
controls without diarrhea. The stool microbiome in active MC was characterized 
by a lower alpha diversity as compared to controls and the remission phase of 
MC. Compared to controls, we identified eight enriched species in MC, most of 
which were pro-inflammatory oral-typical species, such as Veillonella dispar and 
Haemophilus parainfluenzae . In contrast, 11 species, including 
anti-inflammatory microbes such as Blautia glucerasea and Bacteroides stercoris, 
were depleted in MC. Similarly, pro-inflammatory metabolites, including 
lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens were 
enriched in active MC as compared to controls or MC cases in remission. 
Multi-omics association analyses revealed strong and concordant links between 
microbes, their metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles, supporting the 
tight interplay between disturbances in stool microbiome and metabolome in MC.
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant shift in stool microbial and metabolomic 
composition in MC. Our findings could be used in the future for development of 
non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring MC and developing novel 
therapeutics.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Microbiome dysbiosis has been proposed to 
contribute to microscopic colitis (MC) pathogenesis.However, previous studies 
have been limited by small sample sizes, reliance on 16S rRNA sequencing 
technique, potential confounding by stool consistency, and lack of functional 
analyses of microbiome and longitudinal data. Moreover, the metabolomic 
composition of MC remain largely unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In this largest longitudinal MC cohort with two control 
groups - chronic diarrhea controls and controls without diarrhea, gut microbiome 
of MC is characterized by a lower alpha diversity, enriched pro-inflammatory 
oral-typical species and depleted anti-inflammatory beneficial species.Gut 
metabolome of MC shows significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory metabolites, 
including lactosylceramides, ceramides, lysophospholipids, and lysoplasmalogens. 
Multi-omics analyses demonstrate strong and concordant relationships between 
microbes, metabolic pathways, and metabolomic profiles.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: Our findings could 
facilitate development of non-invasive biomarkers and novel therapeutics for MC.

Non-human-associated microbial communities play important biological roles, but 
they remain less understood than human-associated communities. Here, we assess 
the impact of key environmental sample properties on a variety of 
state-of-the-art metagenomic analysis methods. In simulated datasets, all 
methods performed similarly at high taxonomic ranks, but newer marker-based 
methods incorporating metagenomic assembled genomes outperformed others at lower 
taxonomic levels. In real environmental data, taxonomic profiles assigned to the 
same sample by different methods showed little agreement at lower taxonomic 
levels, but the methods agreed better on community diversity estimates and 
estimates of the relationships between environmental parameters and microbial 
profiles.

BACKGROUND: The association between alterations in the oral microbiome and hand, 
foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has been observed in previous studies. Our study, 
therefore, aimed to identify the structural changes in the oral microbiota and 
biomarkers in children with HFMD caused by enterovirus A 71 (EV-A71).
METHODS: Children diagnosed with EV-A71 HFMD and healthy children recruited from 
April 2021 to September 2023 were included in the present study, and were 
categorized into EV-A71 and control groups, respectively. Oral swabs were 
collected and microbiota information was obtained using 16 S rRNA gene 
sequencing technology. Alpha-diversity and partial least squares discriminant 
analyses were conducted to compare microbial diversity, richness, and similarity 
between the two groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size was employed to 
identify microbial taxa with significant differences, and determined the key 
genera among them.
RESULTS: The study included a total of 80 children, with 50 assigned to the 
EV-A71 group and 30 to the control group. No significant differences were found 
between the two groups in terms of age (2.2 ± 1.2 vs. 2.7 ± 1.2 years; age 
range: 1-5 years; P = 0.114) or sex (56% vs. 60% boys, P = 0.726). The oral 
microbiota structure in the EV-A71 group differed from that in the control 
group. The EV-A71 group showed significant reductions in both the Shannon index 
(P = 0.037) and the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) index (P < 0.001). 
The key genus changes were marked by a significant decrease in the abundance of 
Capnocytophaga (P = 0.002) and Leptotrichia (P = 0.033) in the EV-A71 group.
CONCLUSION: In children with EV-A71 HFMD, the oral microbiota showed changes in 
composition, with a significant reduction in diversity and richness. The changes 
in key genera were a marked decrease in the abundance of Capnocytophaga and 
Leptotrichia.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a multifaceted and heterogeneous group of 
complex diseases. Unfortunately, a cure for these conditions has yet to be 
found, but there are ways to reduce the risk of developing them. Studies have 
shown that specific vitamins regulate the brain molecules and signaling 
pathways, which may help prevent degeneration. This review focuses on examining 
the role of vitamins in preventing five significant types of neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS). This review also highlights promising and controversial 
findings about the potential impact of vitamins on this group of diseases. 
Several developed countries standardize daily dietary vitamin intake to meet 
nutrient requirements, improve health, and prevent chronic diseases like NDDs. 
However, more research is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding 
of their therapeutic benefits, including studies exploring different drug-dose 
paradigms, diverse humanized animal models, and clinical trials conducted in 
various locations.

Helicobacter pylori infection is a major risk factor for gastric 
adenocarcinomas. In the case of the intestinal subtype, chronic gastritis and 
intestinal metaplasia are well-known sequential steps in carcinogenesis. H. 
pylori has high genetic diversity that can modulate virulence and pathogenicity 
in the human host as a cag Pathogenicity Island (cagPAI). However, bacterial 
gene combinations do not always explain the clinical presentation of the 
disease, indicating that other factors associated with H. pylori may play a role 
in the development of gastric disease. In this context, we characterized the 
microbial composition of patients with chronic gastritis (inactive and active), 
intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer as well as their potential association 
with H. pylori. To this end, 16 S rRNA metagenomic analysis was performed on 
gastric mucosa samples from patients with different types of lesions and normal 
gastric tissues. Our main finding was that H. pylori virulence status can 
contribute to significant differences in the constitution of the gastric 
microbiota between the sequential steps of the carcinogenesis cascade. 
Differential microbiota was observed in inactive and active gastritis dependent 
of the H. pylori presence and status (p = 0.000575). Pseudomonades, the most 
abundant order in the gastritis, was associated the presence of non-virulent H. 
pylori in the active gastritis. Notably, there are indicator genera according to 
H. pylori status that are poorly associated with diseases and provide additional 
evidence that the microbiota, in addition to H. pylori, is relevant to gastric 
carcinogenesis.

Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are macromolecular assemblies that deliver 
toxic effector proteins between adjacent bacteria. These effectors span a wide 
range of protein families that all lack canonical signal sequences that would 
target them for export. Consequently, it remains incompletely understood how 
conserved structural components of the T6SS apparatus recognize a diverse 
repertoire of effectors. Here, we characterize a widespread family of adaptor 
proteins, containing the domain of unknown function DUF4123, that enable the 
recognition and export of evolutionarily unrelated effectors. By examining two 
nearly identical paralogs of the conserved T6SS spike protein, VgrG, we 
demonstrate that each spike protein exports a structurally unique effector. We 
further show that the recruitment of each effector to its respective spike 
protein requires a cognate adaptor protein. Protein-protein interaction 
experiments demonstrate that these adaptor proteins specifically tether an 
effector to a structurally conserved but sequence divergent helix-turn-helix 
motif found at the C-terminus of its cognate VgrG. Using structural predictions 
and mutagenesis analyses, we elucidate the molecular contacts required for these 
interactions and discover that these adaptor proteins contain a structurally 
conserved N-terminal lobe that has evolved to bind VgrG helix-turn-helix motifs 
and a structurally variable C-terminal lobe that recognizes diverse effector 
families. Overall, our work provides molecular insight into a mechanism by which 
conserved T6SS components recognize structurally diverse effectors.

Oral microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of schizophrenia (SZ). 
While numerous studies have investigated alterations in the oral bacterial 
microbiota among SZ patients, investigations into the fungal microbiota, another 
integral component of the oral microbiota, are scarce. In this cross-sectional 
study, we enrolled 118 Chinese patients with SZ and 97 age-matched healthy 
controls (HCs) to evaluate the oral fungal microbiota from tongue coating 
samples using internal transcribed spacer 1 amplicon sequencing and assess host 
immunity via multiplex immunoassays. Our findings revealed that SZ patients 
exhibited reduced fungal richness and significant differences in β-diversity 
compared to HCs. Within the oral fungal communities, we identified two distinct 
fungal clusters (mycotypes): Candida and Malassezia, with SZ patients showing 
increased Malassezia and decreased Candida levels. These key functional oral 
fungi may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SZ. Furthermore, SZ 
patients displayed signs of immunological dysfunction, characterized by elevated 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, and chemokines 
including MIP-1α and MCP-1. Importantly, Malassezia mycotype correlated 
positively with peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, while Candida mycotype 
exhibited a negative correlation with these cytokines. In conclusion, we have 
demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of altered oral fungal 
communities and systemic immune dysfunction in Chinese SZ patients compared to 
HCs, providing novel insights into the potential role of oral fungi as 
biomarkers and the broader implications for understanding SZ pathogenesis.

The phyllosphere of plants hosts diverse fungal microbial communities. Despite 
the significant impact of plant fungal diseases on productivity and community 
ecology, the relationship between phyllosphere fungal communities and plant 
health in natural environments remains poorly understood. This study utilized 
high-throughput sequencing and field investigations to explore the composition, 
dynamics, and incidence of fungal diseases across 29 plant species from four 
functional groups (forbs, grasses, legumes, and sedges) in alpine meadow plant 
communities of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We identified Ascomycetes and 
Basidiomycetes as the predominant phyllosphere fungi. Significant differences 
were observed in the Shannon diversity index, β-diversity, indicator fungi, and 
hub fungi among the functional groups. With the exception of the sedge group, 
the incidence of fungal diseases in other groups was positively correlated with 
the proportion of pathogens in the phyllosphere fungal community. Predictive 
analyses revealed that Ascochyta was strongly associated with high disease 
incidence in grasses, Cercospora in forbs, and Podosphaera in legumes, while 
Calophoma was associated with low disease incidence in sedges. These findings 
enhance our understanding of how plant phyllosphere fungal communities assemble 
in natural environments and improve our ability to predict and manage foliar 
fungal diseases in alpine meadows.

Diverse extraintestinal diseases are characterized by localized inflammatory 
responses and tissue damage, accompanied with intestinal inflammation and 
injury. Here, a dual-functionality and dual-location intervention strategy is 
reported, which is the use of hyaluronic acid-nanocoated Clostridium butyricum 
to generate an anti-inflammatory tissue-repair effect in the impaired gut and 
extraintestinal organs. Nanocoated bacteria attenuate intestinal mucosal 
inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity by leveraging the 
immunosuppressive nature of hyaluronic acid and the butyrate-producing ability 
of Clostridium butyricum. Nanocoated bacteria also alleviate the interstitial 
inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling 
microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. In murine models 
of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, oral delivery of nanocoated 
bacteria demonstrates the potency to restore renal function and eliminate renal 
fibrosis. This work proposes a type of next-generation living therapeutics for 
treating extraintestinal diseases.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: It is presently unclear why there is a high 
prevalence of periodontal disease in individuals living with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Whilst some have argued that periodontal disease causes CKD, we 
hypothesised that alterations in saliva and the oral microenvironment in 
organisms with kidney disease may initiate periodontal disease by causing 
dysbiosis of the oral microbiota.
METHODS: Experimental kidney disease was created using adenine feeding and 
subtotal nephrectomy in rats, and by adenine feeding in mice. Loss of 
periodontal bone height was assessed using a dissecting microscope supported by 
micro-CT, light, confocal and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. 
Salivary biochemistry was assessed using NMR spectroscopy. The oral microbiome 
was evaluated using culture-based and molecular methods, and the 
transmissibility of dysbiosis was assessed using co-caging and microbial 
transfer experiments into previously germ-free recipient mice.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that experimental kidney disease causes a reproducible 
reduction of alveolar bone height, without gingival inflammation or overt 
hyperparathyroidism but with evidence of failure of bone formation at the 
periodontal crest. We show that kidney disease alters the biochemical 
composition of saliva and induces progressive dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, 
with microbial samples from animals with kidney disease displaying reduced 
overall bacterial growth, increased alpha diversity, reduced abundance of key 
components of the healthy oral microbiota such as Streptococcus and Rothia, and 
an increase in minor taxa including those from gram-negative phyla 
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Co-housing diseased rats with healthy ones 
ameliorates the periodontal disease phenotype, whilst transfer of oral 
microbiota from mice with kidney disease causes periodontal disease in germ-free 
animals with normal kidney function.
CONCLUSIONS: We advocate that periodontal disease should be regarded as a 
complication of kidney disease, initiated by oral dysbiosis through mechanisms 
independent of overt inflammation or hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a 
global health crisis, with clinical manifestations including those suggesting 
injury to various organs such as the ovaries, which implies that it extends 
beyond respiratory infections. Changes in gut microbiota may exhibit 
correlations with the mechanisms and stages of severity in COVID-19, as well as 
a link with sex hormones, embryo development, and pregnancy. Controlled ovarian 
stimulation (COS) is used to induce the development of multiple high-quality 
follicles during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our research aimed to investigate 
whether patients infected with COVID-19 have altered gut microbiota compositions 
that would affect the outcomes of COS.
METHODS: Twenty-one healthy females and seventeen patients with COVID-19 were 
enrolled. Samples were sequenced for gut microbiota identification through 16 S 
rRNA V3-V4 region, including species annotation, community diversity, and 
community functions.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of in 
IVF cycle outcomes and laboratory parameters. Patients with COVID-19 and healthy 
women showed no significant difference in the total number of available 
blastocyst embryos. Furthermore, the gut microbiota alpha diversity index in the 
COVID-19 group were markedly reduced compared to those of healthy females. 
Comparing the COVID-19 group to the controls, the gut microbiota dysbiosis 
decreased levels of Ruminococcus, and Agathobater, and elevated levels of 
Achromobacter and Raistonia. Finally, we identified a series of microbial 
functional characteristics, including membrane transport and carbohydrate 
metabolism, that exhibited significant disparities between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the COVID-19 group exhibited significant disparities in 
the gut microbiota composition compared to the healthy women during COS. 
However, the IVF outcomes did not show any significant differences between the 
two groups. Collectively, our speculation suggests that SARS-COV-2 infection may 
alter the gut microbiota without impacting IVF outcomes.

Rotavirus (RV) accounts for 19.11% of global diarrheal deaths. Though GAVI 
assisted vaccine introduction has curtailed RV induced mortality, factors like 
RV strain diversity, differential infantile gut microbiome, malnutrition, 
interference from maternal antibodies and other administered vaccines, etc. 
often compromise vaccine efficacy. Herein emerges the need of antivirals which 
can be administered adjunct to vaccination to curb the socio-economic burden 
stemming from frequent RV infection. Cognisance of pathogen-perturbed host 
cellular physiology has revolutionized translational research and aided 
precision-based therapy, particularly for viruses, with no metabolic machinery 
of their own. To date there has been limited exploration of the host cellular 
metabolome in context of RV infection. In this study, we explored the 
endometabolomic landscape of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) on 
RV-SA11 infection. Significant alteration of host cellular metabolic pathways 
like the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, alanine, aspartate and glutamate 
metabolism pathway, the host citric acid cycle was observed in RV-SA11 infection 
scenario. Detailed study further revealed that RV replication is exclusively 
dependent on glutamine metabolism for their propagation in host cells. Glutamine 
metabolism generates glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine which facilitates 
virus infection. Abrogation of aspartate biogenesis from glutamine by use of 
Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), significantly curbed RV-SA11 infection in-vitro and 
in-vivo. Overall, the study improves our understanding of host-rotavirus 
interactome and recognizes host glutamine metabolism pathway as a suitable 
target for effective therapeutic intervention against RV infection.

Mango bacterial black spot is a major disease limiting mango production, which 
is now causing increasingly severe economic losses. In this study, we analyzed 
the differences in the composition and structure of bacterial and fungal 
communities in the pulp and leaves between the healthy mangoes of variety Kate 
and those affected by bacterial black spot, and attempted to explore potential 
biocontrol microorganisms for mangoes. The results showed there existed 
significant differences in microbial communities, the bacterial 
Stenotrophomonas, Curtobacterium, Massilia and fungous Penicillium, Alternaria, 
Aureobasidiu showed great abundance both in pulps and leaves. Some potential 
pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Burkholderia, were 
also significantly enriched in the infected groups. In both the infected and 
healthy groups, the overall community structure of endophytic bacteria and fungi 
within the same organs was more similar, indicating that the composition of 
endophytes is organ-specific. After infection, the abundance of the potential 
probiotic bacterium class Paenibacillus was significantly increased both in 
leaves and pulp, suggesting that the pathogen invasion stimulated the defense 
systems of endophytes. Presumably, these Paenibacillus might be developed as 
defense bacteria for black spot as well as other plant diseases.

The Dickeya genus comprises numerous pathogenic species that cause diseases in 
various crops, vegetables, and ornamental plants across the globe. The pathogens 
have become very widespread in recent years, and numerous newly identified 
Dickeya-associated plant diseases have been reported, which poses an immense 
threat to agricultural production and is a serious concern internationally. 
Evidence is accumulating that a diversity of hosts, environmental habitats, and 
climates seems to shape the abundance of Dickeya species in nature and the 
differentiation of pathogenic mechanisms. This review summarizes the latest 
findings on the genome diversity and pathogenic mechanisms of Dickeya spp., with 
a focus on the intricate virulence regulatory mechanisms mediated by quorum 
sensing and pathogen-host interkingdom communication systems.

The biological properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and amyloid proteins 
and their cross-talks have gained increasing attention due to their potential 
implications in both host defense mechanisms and amyloid-related diseases. 
However, complex interactions, molecular mechanisms, and physiological 
applications are not fully understood. The interplay between antimicrobial 
peptides and amyloid proteins is crucial for uncovering new insights into immune 
defense and disease mechanisms, bridging critical gaps in understanding 
infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides an overview of 
the cross-talk between AMPs and amyloids, highlighting their intricate 
interplay, mechanisms of action, and potential therapeutic implications. The 
dual roles of AMPs, which not only serve as key components of the innate immune 
system, combating microbial infections, but also exhibit modulatory effects on 
amyloid formation and toxicity, are discussed. The diverse mechanisms employed 
by AMPs to modulate amyloid aggregation, fibril formation, and toxicity are also 
discussed. Additionally, we explore emerging evidence suggesting that amyloid 
proteins may possess antimicrobial properties, adding a new dimension to the 
intricate relationship between AMPs and amyloids. This review underscores the 
importance of understanding the cross-talk between AMPs and amyloids to better 
understand the molecular processes underlying infectious diseases and 
amyloid-related disorders and to aid in the development of therapeutic avenues 
to treat them.

Microorganisms on amphibian skin reduce disease susceptibility and play an 
important role in pathogen defense. We hypothesized that anuran skin bacterial 
communities would change in response to seasonal variation and host species. To 
test this hypothesis, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify cutaneous 
bacterial communities of two frogs from the Qinling Mountains of China, 
Pelophylax nigromaculatus and Nanorana quadranus. We matched the amplicon 
sequence variants (ASVs) of microbes exhibiting protective effects against the 
pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), using a database containing over 
1900 16S rRNA gene sequences from amphibian skin bacteria. The results showed 
that seasonal variation had a stronger effect than host species on the structure 
(alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, species composition and abundance, and 
biomarkers) and anti-Bd function of cutaneous bacterial communities. These 
communities were highly dynamic but varied similarly between hosts. Their 
structural similarities were more consistent at the phylum level, but markedly 
less so at finer taxonomic levels. The highest relative abundance of anti-Bd 
reads was observed in P. nigromaculatus during summer, but anti-Bd reads were 
present in both frog species during different seasons. Therefore, the protective 
function of cutaneous microbial communities appears to be continuous despite 
between-species differences in anti-Bd ASV abundance. This observation does not 
directly explain why Bd infections have not been recorded in the region, 
butprovides important insight on anuran pathogen defense mechanisms. Our 
findings also suggest that specific seasons can be periods of high infection 
risk, with major implications for research on amphibian ecology and 
conservation.

BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Enterobacterales constitutes a 
significant threat to the health of both humans and animals and a socioeconomic 
problem. Enterobacterales, mainly Escherichia coli, carrying β-lactamases has 
become one of the main indicators to estimate the burden of AMR in animals 
within "One Health" approach.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the presence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant 
Enterobacterales associated with ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) habituated in 
all five provinces of Rwanda and to perform in depth characterization of 
isolates.
METHODS: We screened 454 rectal swabs from 203 cows, 170 goats, and 81 sheep and 
selective isolation of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant 
Enterobacterales was conducted. Isolates were identified as a members of the 
order Enterobacterales by MALDI-TOF MS and further characterized by 
susceptibility testing and by whole-genome sequencing.
RESULTS: Out of the 454 samples, 64 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant 
Enterobacterales were isolated from 58 animals. Isolates belonged to seven 
bacterial species and were identified as Escherichia coli (n = 54), Enterobacter 
bugandensis (n = 4), Enterobacter mori (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), 
Enterobacter dykesii (n = 1), and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1). All isolates 
displayed an Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) phenotype, with exception of 
Citrobacter freundii isolate displayed both an ESBL and AmpC phenotype. In 
addition, all Enterobacter isolates were identified as stably de-repressed 
AmpC-producers. ESBLs genes, blaCTX-M-15 was predominant. Resistance to 
tetracycline and tet(A) was most frequently observed among non-β-lactam 
resistance. Forty-eight isolates displayed multidrug-resistance phenotypes. A 
shiga toxin-producing E. coli and an enterotoxigenic E. coli isolate were 
observed. Genome comparisons revealed thirty-five E. coli sequence types (ST) 
(ST10, ST307 being predominate).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high proximity between ruminants and humans in 
Rwanda, the dissemination of antimicrobial drug resistance highlights the public 
health threats and requires the joint and multisectoral action of human and 
veterinary medicine, at human-animal-environment interfaces. Therefore, it is 
important to establish national and global "One Health" surveillance programs of 
AMR to tackle the antibiotic-resistant crisis in human and veterinary medicine.

Complex transcriptional control is a conserved feature of both eukaryotes and 
the viruses that infect them. Despite viral genomes being smaller and more gene 
dense than their hosts, we generally lack a sense of scope for the features 
governing the transcriptional output of individual viral genes. Even having a 
seemingly simple expression pattern does not imply that a gene's underlying 
regulation is straightforward. Here, we illustrate this by combining 
high-density functional genomics, expression profiling, and viral-specific 
chromosome conformation capture to define with unprecedented detail the 
transcriptional regulation of a single gene from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated 
herpesvirus (KSHV). We used as our model KSHV ORF68 - which has simple, early 
expression kinetics and is essential for viral genome packaging. We first 
identified seven cis-regulatory regions involved in ORF68 expression by densely 
tiling the ~154 kb KSHV genome with dCas9 fused to a transcriptional repressor 
domain (CRISPRi). A parallel Cas9 nuclease screen indicated that three of these 
regions act as promoters of genes that regulate ORF68. RNA expression profiling 
demonstrated that three more of these regions act by either repressing or 
enhancing other distal viral genes involved in ORF68 transcriptional regulation. 
Finally, we tracked how the 3D structure of the viral genome changes during its 
lifecycle, revealing that these enhancing regulatory elements are physically 
closer to their targets when active, and that disrupting some elements caused 
large-scale changes to the 3D genome. These data enable us to construct a 
complete model revealing that the mechanistic diversity of this essential 
regulatory circuit matches that of human genes.

Rhizogenic Agrobacterium, the causative agent of hairy root disease (HRD), is 
known for its high phenotypic and genetic diversity. The taxonomy of rhizogenic 
agrobacteria has undergone several changes in the past and is still somewhat 
controversial. While the classification of Agrobacterium strains was initially 
mainly based on phenotypic properties and the symptoms they induced on plants, 
more and more genetic information has been used along the years to infer 
Agrobacterium taxonomy. This has led to the definition of the so-called 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens species complex (Atsc), which comprises several 
genomospecies. Interestingly, the rhizogenic Agrobacterium strains are found in 
several of these genomospecies. Nevertheless, even up until today Agrobacterium 
strains, and in particular rhizogenic agrobacteria, are prone to 
misclassification and considerable confusion in literature. In this study, we 
evaluated different phylogenetic analysis approaches for their use to improve 
Agrobacterium taxonomy and tried to gain more insight in the classification of 
strains into this complex genus, with a particular focus on rhizogenic 
agrobacteria. The genome sequence analysis of 580 assemblies, comprising 
Agrobacterium, Allorhizobium and Rhizobium strains demonstrated that phylogenies 
based on single marker genes, such as the commonly used 16S rRNA and recA gene, 
do not provide sufficient resolution for proper delineation of the different 
genomospecies within the Atsc. Our results revealed that (in silico) multi-locus 
sequences analysis (MLSA) in combination with average nucleotide identity (ANIb) 
at a 94.0% threshold delineates genomospecies accurately and efficiently. 
Additionally, this latter approach permitted the identification of two new 
candidate genomospecies.

This study aimed to elucidate the resistance trends of P. aeruginosa isolates 
from 2005 to 2023 in Zhejiang Province, emphasizing the impact of Coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) on antimicrobial resistance patterns and clinical 
management. We retrospectively analyzed 7326 P. aeruginosa isolates collected 
from diverse clinical sources in a tertiary hospital in Zhejiang Province from 
2005 to 2023. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of each 
isolate were performed using the VITEK-32 automated system and the disk 
diffusion method, following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
guidelines. We assessed resistance patterns for key antibiotic classes relevant 
to P. aeruginosa treatment, including carbapenems, β-lactams, aminoglycosides, 
and quinolones. Statistical analyses, including trend evaluations and resistance 
determinant assessments, were conducted in R software (version 4.2.2), with 
visualizations generated through ggplot2 to illustrate resistance trends over 
time. This study focused on key anti-pseudomonal agents including carbapenems 
(imipenem and meropenem), β-lactams (piperacillin), and quinolones 
(ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin). We observed a progressive increase in 
resistance to imipenem from 6.8% in 2005 to 48.2% in 2023 and meropenem from 
25.4% to 44.2% over the same period. Conversely, resistance rates to 
aminoglycosides declined, with gentamicin resistance dropping from 22.0% in 2005 
to 5.0% in 2019. Cephalosporins exhibited variable trends, with cefepime 
resistance peaking at 40.4% in 2013 before declining to 12.1% in 2023. The 
findings indicated a progressive increase in resistance rates for these 
antibiotics, with notable peaks coinciding with changes in clinical practices 
and the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis demonstrated that shifts in prescription 
habits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, influenced resistance 
patterns, underscoring the need for context-specific antimicrobial stewardship 
strategies. This study identifies significant, evolving resistance patterns in 
P. aeruginosa over a 19-year period, with marked increases in resistance to 
critical antibiotics, including carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem), quinolones 
(levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), and certain β-lactams (piperacillin). These 
findings underscore an urgent need for dynamic, tailored infection control 
measures, emphasizing the importance of robust antibiotic stewardship programs, 
localized treatment guidelines, and proactive monitoring of resistance trends. 
Implementing these strategies is essential to effectively counter the challenges 
posed by multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa, improve patient outcomes, and 
sustain the efficacy of vital antibiotic therapies.

Data from the literature indicates that the human ocular surface is inhabited by 
diverse commensal microbial communities, crucial for maintaining the homeostasis 
of healthy eyes. The ocular surface microbiome (OSM) plays a protective 
immunoregulatory role against pathogenic species, and any dysbiosis may 
contribute to disease onset. Traditional culture methods, employed in both 
clinical and research settings, have limitations. Certain pathogens are 
challenging to grow under routine conditions, leading to lower bacterial 
detection compared to next-generation sequencing (NGS). Despite the extensive 
use of NGS in published studies, variable results are observed. This variability 
may be attributed to factors such as limited sample size, differences in 
analytical procedures (from sampling to sequencing platforms), age and gender 
variations in included populations, diverse inclusion criteria, and geographical 
differences. These factors collectively impact the generated genomic data. 
Moreover, consistent reports on diversity indices are lacking in various 
published studies, whereas these indices could enhance the definition of OSM 
changes in disease states. Therefore, this review emphasizes the current 
imperative to standardize OSM sample collection, preparation, and analysis. This 
standardization is vital for accurately defining the composition of OSM in both 
healthy and pathogenic conditions and facilitating meaningful comparisons among 
studies.

The human intestinal tract is densely colonized by a microbial community that is 
subject to intense competition. Bacteria in this complex habitat seek to 
outcompete their neighbors for nutrients and eliminate competitors with 
antibacterial toxins. Antagonism can be mediated by diverse effectors including 
toxic proteins and small molecule inhibitors that are released extracellularly 
or delivered by specialized secretion systems to targeted cells. Two 
prototypical microbiota-derived enterotoxins, colibactin and tilimycin, and the 
newly discovered family of indolimines represent an expanding group of 
non-proteinaceous small molecules which specifically target DNA. In addition to 
cell killing, they generate mutations and genome instability in intoxicated 
microbes and host cells alike. They have been studied in detail because of their 
direct toxicity to human cells and important etiological roles in intestinal 
pathologies. Increasing evidence, however, reveals that these commensal 
genotoxins are also mediators of interbacterial antagonism, which impacts gut 
microbial ecology. In this review, we illustrate the functional versatility of 
commensal genotoxins in the gut ecosystem.

BACKGROUND: Sustainable agriculture increasingly emphasizes the importance of 
microbial communities in influencing plant health and productivity. In 
viticulture, understanding the impact of management practices on fungal 
communities is critical, given their role in disease dynamics, grape and wine 
quality. This study investigates the effects of integrated, organic, and 
biodynamic management practices on the diversity and function of fungal 
communities in a vineyard located in Geisenheim, Germany, focusing on 
above-ground parts such as bark, leaves, and grapes.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that while overall fungal species richness did 
not significantly differ among management systems across various compartments, 
the composition of these communities was distinctly influenced by the type of 
management system. In particular, leaf and grape compartments showed notable 
variations in fungal community structure between integrated and 
organic/biodynamic management. No differences were observed between organic and 
biodynamic management. Integrated management demonstrated a significantly higher 
abundance of mycoparasites in comparison to organic and biodynamic management, 
primarily attributed to the increased presence of Sporobolomyces roseus, 
Sporobolomyces ellipsoideus and Rhodotorula glutinis.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of management practices in 
shaping fungal community composition and function in vineyards. Although overall 
species richness remained unaffected, community composition and functional 
diversity varied, highlighting the potential for strategic microbiome management 
to enhance vineyard sustainability and plant health.

BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH) is an economically significant pest of 
rice. Bph3 is a key BPH resistance gene. However, the proteomic response of rice 
to BPH infestation, both in the presence and absence of Bph3, remains largely 
unexplored.
RESULTS: In this study, we employed tandem mass tag labeling in conjunction with 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in rice samples. We detected 265 and 
125 DEPs via comparison of samples infected with BPH for 2 and 4 days with 
untreated samples of the BPH-sensitive line R582. For the Bph3 introgression 
line R373, we identified 29 and 94 DEPs in the same comparisons. Bioinformatic 
analysis revealed that Bph3 significantly influences the abundance of proteins 
associated with metabolic pathways, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, microbial 
metabolism in diverse environments, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Moreover, 
Bph3 regulates the activity of proteins involved in the calcium signaling 
pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and plant 
hormone signal transduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Bph3 enhances the resistance of rice to 
BPH mainly by inhibiting the down-regulation of proteins associated with 
metabolic pathways; calcium signaling, the MAPK signaling pathway, and plant 
hormone signal transduction might also be involved in BPH resistance induced by 
Bph3.
