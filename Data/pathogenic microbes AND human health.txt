Coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a threat to human health globally, as highlighted by 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome 
(MERS) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Bats from the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) 
are an important natural reservoir for CoVs. Here we report the differential 
prevalence of CoVs in bats within Yunnan Province across biological and 
ecological variables. We also show the coexistence of CoVs in individual bats 
and identify an additional putative host for SARS-related CoV, with higher 
dispersal capacity than other known hosts. Notably, 11 SARS-related 
coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) were discovered in horseshoe bats (family 
Rhinolophidae) and a Chinese water myotis bat (Myotis laniger) by pan-CoV 
detection and Illumina sequencing. Our findings facilitate an understanding of 
the fundamental features of the distribution and circulation of CoVs in nature 
as well as zoonotic spillover risk in the One health framework.

Swine influenza A viruses (IAVsw) are important causes of disease in pigs but 
also constitute a public health risk. IAVsw strains show remarkable differences 
in pathogenicity. We aimed to generate airway organoids from the porcine lower 
respiratory tract and use these to establish well-differentiated airway 
epithelial cell (WD-AEC) cultures grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) for in 
vitro screening of IAVsw strain virulence. Epithelial cells were isolated from 
bronchus tissue of juvenile pigs, and airway organoids were cultured in an 
extracellular matrix in a culture medium containing human growth factors. 
Single-cell suspensions of these 3D organoids were seeded on Transwell filters 
and differentiated at ALI to form a pseudostratified epithelium containing 
ciliated cells, mucus-producing cells and tight junctions. Inoculation with a 
low dose of IAVsw in a low volume inoculum resulted in virus replication without 
requiring the addition of trypsin, and was quantified by the detection of viral 
genome loads in apical washes. Interestingly, inoculation of an H3N2 strain 
known to cause severe disease in pigs induced a greater reduction in 
trans-epithelial resistance and more damage to tight junctions than H1N2 or H1N1 
strains associated with mild disease in pigs. We conclude that the porcine 
WD-AEC model is useful in assessing the virulence of IAVsw strains.

Vibrio vulnificus is a significant opportunistic pathogen with the highest 
fatality rate among foodborne microbes. However, due to a lack of comprehensive 
surveillance, the characteristics of isolates in China remain poorly understood. 
This study analyzed 60 strains of V. vulnificus isolated from diverse sources in 
Shanghai, including shellfish, crabs, shrimps, throat swabs of migratory birds, 
as well as seafood farming water and seawater. Identification of the genotypes 
was performed using PCR, and cytotoxicity was determined using an LDH assay. DNA 
was sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq followed by a bioinformatic analysis. The 
results demonstrated that a majority of the strains belonged to the 16S rRNA 
B-vcgC genotype. All strains carried five antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), 
with some strains carrying over ten ARGs, mediating resistance to multiple 
antibiotics. Five strains possessed a highly abundant effector delivery system, 
which further investigations revealed to be a type III secretion system II 
(T3SS2), marking the first description of T3SS2 in V. vulnificus. Phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that it belonged to a different genetic lineage from T3SS2α 
and T3SS2β of V. parahaemolyticus. Bacteria with T3SS2 sequences were 
concentrated in coastal areas and mostly within the genus Vibrio in the global 
prevalence survey. Our study provides essential baseline information for 
non-clinical V. vulnificus and discovers the existence of T3SS2 in several 
strains which may be more virulent, thereby posing a new threat to human health.

The human gut is a complex ecosystem that supports billions of living species, 
including bacteria, viruses, archaea, phages, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes. 
Bacteria give genes and enzymes for microbial and host-produced compounds, 
establishing a symbiotic link between the external environment and the host at 
both the gut and systemic levels. The gut microbiome, which is primarily made up 
of commensal bacteria, is critical for maintaining the healthy host's immune 
system, aiding digestion, synthesizing essential nutrients, and protecting 
against pathogenic bacteria, as well as influencing endocrine, neural, humoral, 
and immunological functions and metabolic pathways. Qualitative, quantitative, 
and/or topographic shifts can alter the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis 
and microbial dysfunction, which can contribute to a variety of noncommunicable 
illnesses, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. While most 
evidence to date is observational and does not establish direct causation, 
ongoing clinical trials and advanced genomic techniques are steadily enhancing 
our understanding of these intricate interactions. This review will explore key 
aspects of the relationship between gut microbiota, eubiosis, and dysbiosis in 
human health and disease, highlighting emerging strategies for microbiome 
engineering as potential therapeutic approaches for various conditions.

Genomic Characterization of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Strains: Potential 
Probiotics from Ethiopian Traditional Fermented Cottage Cheese.

of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa P.O. Box 9086, Ethiopia.

Antwerp, 2000 Antwerp, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a species found in a wide range of 
ecological niches, including vegetables and dairy products, and it may occur 
naturally in the human gastrointestinal tract. The precise mechanisms underlying 
the beneficial properties of these microbes to their host remain obscure. 
Although Lactic acid bacteria are generally regarded as safe, there are rare 
cases of the emergence of infections and antibiotic resistance by certain 
probiotics.
OBJECTIVE: An in silico whole genome sequence analysis of putative probiotic 
bacteria was set up to identify strains, predict desirable functional 
properties, and identify potentially detrimental antibiotic resistance and 
virulence genes.
METHODS: We characterized the genomes of three L. plantarum strains (54B, 54C, 
and 55A) isolated from Ethiopian traditional cottage cheese. Whole-genome 
sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The completeness and 
quality of the genome of L. plantarum strains were assessed through CheckM.
RESULTS: Analyses results showed that L. plantarum 54B and 54C are closely 
related but different strains. The genomes studied did not harbor resistance and 
virulence factors. They had five classes of carbohydrate-active enzymes with 
several important functions. Cyclic lactone autoinducer, terpenes, Type III 
polyketide synthases, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified 
peptides-like gene clusters, sactipeptides, and all genes required for 
riboflavin biosynthesis were identified, evidencing their promising probiotic 
properties. Six bacteriocin-like structures encoding genes were found in the 
genome of L. plantarum 55A.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of resistome and virulome and their previous functional 
capabilities suggest the potential applicability of these strains in food 
industries as bio-preservatives and in the prevention and/or treatment of 
infectious diseases. The results also provide insights into the probiotic 
potential and safety of these three strains and indicate avenues for further 
mechanistic studies using these isolates.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global morbidity and 
mortality. Recent advancements in high-throughput omics techniques have enhanced 
our understanding of the human microbiome's role in the development of CVDs. 
Although the relationship between the gut microbiome and CVDs has attracted 
considerable research attention and has been rapidly evolving in recent years, 
the role of the oral microbiome remains less understood, with most prior studies 
focusing on periodontitis-related pathogens. In this review, we summarized 
previously reported associations between the oral microbiome and CVD, 
highlighting known CVD-associated taxa such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, 
Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. We also 
discussed the interactions between the oral and gut microbes. The potential 
mechanisms by which the oral microbiota can influence CVD development include 
oral and systemic inflammation, immune responses, cytokine release, 
translocation of oral bacteria into the bloodstream, and the impact of 
microbial-related products such as microbial metabolites (e.g., short-chain 
fatty acids [SCFAs], trimethylamine oxide [TMAO], hydrogen sulfide [H2S], nitric 
oxide [NO]) and specific toxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS], leukotoxin 
[LtxA]). The processes driven by these mechanisms may contribute to 
atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and other cardiovascular pathologies. 
Integrated multi-omics methodologies, along with large-scale longitudinal 
population studies and intervention studies, will facilitate a deeper 
understanding of the metabolic and functional roles of the oral microbiome in 
cardiovascular health. This fundamental knowledge will support the development 
of targeted interventions and effective therapies to prevent or reduce the 
progression from cardiovascular risk to clinical CVD events.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a valuable model for studying 
host-pathogen interactions due to its unique combination of characteristics. 
These include extensive sequence and functional conservation with the human 
genome, optical transparency in larvae that allows for high-resolution 
visualization of host cell-microbe interactions, a fully sequenced and annotated 
genome, advanced forward and reverse genetic tools, and suitability for chemical 
screening studies. Despite anatomical differences with humans, the zebrafish 
model has proven instrumental in investigating immune responses and human 
infectious diseases. Notably, zebrafish larvae rely exclusively on innate immune 
responses during the early stages of development, as the adaptive immune system 
becomes fully functional only after 4-6 weeks post-fertilization. This window 
provides a unique opportunity to isolate and examine infection and inflammation 
mechanisms driven by the innate immune response without the confounding effects 
of adaptive immunity. In this review, we highlight the strengths and limitations 
of using zebrafish as a powerful vertebrate model to study innate immune 
responses in infectious diseases. We will particularly focus on host-pathogen 
interactions in human infections caused by various bacteria (Clostridioides 
difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), viruses (herpes 
simplex virus 1, SARS-CoV-2), and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida 
albicans).

Human breast milk (HBM) is considered the gold standard for infant nutrition due 
to its optimal nutrient profile and complex composition of cellular and 
non-cellular components. Breastfeeding positively influences the newborn's gut 
microbiota and health, reducing the risk of conditions like gastrointestinal 
infections and chronic diseases (e.g., allergies, asthma, diabetes, and 
obesity). Research has revealed that HBM contains beneficial microbes that aid 
gut microbiota maturation through mechanisms like antimicrobial production and 
pathogen exclusion. The HBM microbiota composition can be affected by several 
factors, including gestational age, delivery mode, medical treatments, lactation 
stage, as well as maternal lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, physical activity, 
sleep quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, stress level). Particularly, 
lifestyle factors can play a significant role in shaping the HBM microbiota by 
directly modulating the microbial composition or influencing the maternal gut 
microbiota and influencing the HBM microbes through the enteromammary pathway. 
This narrative review of current findings summarized how maternal lifestyle 
influences HBM microbiota. While the influence of maternal diet on HBM 
microbiota is well-documented, indicating that dietary patterns, especially 
those rich in plant-based proteins and complex carbohydrates, can positively 
influence HBM microbiota, the impact of other lifestyle factors is poorly 
investigated. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
is crucial for the health of both mother and baby. Understanding how maternal 
lifestyle factors influence microbial colonization of HBM, along with their 
interactions and impact, is key to developing new strategies that support the 
beneficial maturation of the infant's gut microbiota.

Association between ileal colonization by Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli 
(AIEC) and Crohn's disease (CD) has been widely described in high-incidence 
Western countries but remains unexplored in Asian countries with a fast increase 
in CD incidence. In the PACIFIC study, we compared the characteristics of AIEC 
pathobionts retrieved from ileal biopsies of CD patients enrolled in France (FR) 
and Hong Kong (HK). The prevalence of AIEC was similar in France (24.5%, 25/102) 
and Hong Kong (30.0%, 18/60) (p = 0.44). No difference was observed between the 
two populations of AIEC regarding adhesion and invasion levels. When tested for 
antibiotic resistance, the proportion of AIEC strains resistant to ampicillin, 
piperacillin, tobramycin, and gentamicin was significantly higher in HK AIEC 
strains compared to French strains. AIEC strains from FR or HK population were 
both able to persist in the mice intestine (DSS-treated CEABAC10 mice model). 
Moreover, genomic analysis of 25 FR and 17 hK AIEC strains using next-generation 
sequencing revealed the co-existence of several virulence factors associated 
with enteric E. coli pathotypes, although no single virulence factor was 
significantly associated with either country of origin or AIEC status. In vitro, 
all AIEC strains (FR and HK) were sensitive to the EcoActive™ phage cocktail, 
suggesting that it could be a promising option to target AIEC in CD across the 
world.

Rotavirus (RV) accounts for 19.11% of global diarrheal deaths. Though GAVI 
assisted vaccine introduction has curtailed RV induced mortality, factors like 
RV strain diversity, differential infantile gut microbiome, malnutrition, 
interference from maternal antibodies and other administered vaccines, etc. 
often compromise vaccine efficacy. Herein emerges the need of antivirals which 
can be administered adjunct to vaccination to curb the socio-economic burden 
stemming from frequent RV infection. Cognisance of pathogen-perturbed host 
cellular physiology has revolutionized translational research and aided 
precision-based therapy, particularly for viruses, with no metabolic machinery 
of their own. To date there has been limited exploration of the host cellular 
metabolome in context of RV infection. In this study, we explored the 
endometabolomic landscape of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) on 
RV-SA11 infection. Significant alteration of host cellular metabolic pathways 
like the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, alanine, aspartate and glutamate 
metabolism pathway, the host citric acid cycle was observed in RV-SA11 infection 
scenario. Detailed study further revealed that RV replication is exclusively 
dependent on glutamine metabolism for their propagation in host cells. Glutamine 
metabolism generates glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine which facilitates 
virus infection. Abrogation of aspartate biogenesis from glutamine by use of 
Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), significantly curbed RV-SA11 infection in-vitro and 
in-vivo. Overall, the study improves our understanding of host-rotavirus 
interactome and recognizes host glutamine metabolism pathway as a suitable 
target for effective therapeutic intervention against RV infection.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of ubiquitous organic 
compounds mainly produced during the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of 
organic materials. Multiple studies have acknowledged PAHs as human carcinogen, 
which necessitates its detoxication from human and animals. Great and continuous 
efforts have been made to alleviate the adverse effects of PAHs to human and 
animals. This study summarizes plenty of techniques, including herbal 
extraction, phytochemicals, commercial agent and microbes, coupled with some 
optimized strategies, have utilized for the detoxication of PAHs, which also 
have limitations. Augmenting the delivery systems of phytochemicals for the 
improvement of sustained release property and enhancement of the 
bioavailability, introducing newly screened microbes for PAHs detoxication via 
biodegrading, as well as engineering microbes for the production of 
phytochemicals and degradation enzymes are the three future aspects needed to be 
considered in-depth.

The continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the threat of future 
Sarbecovirus zoonoses have spurred the design of vaccines that can induce broad 
immunity against multiple coronaviruses. Here, we use computational methods to 
infer ancestral phylogenetic reconstructions of receptor binding domain (RBD) 
sequences across multiple Sarbecovirus clades and incorporate them into a 
multivalent adenoviral-vectored vaccine. Mice immunized with this 
pan-Sarbecovirus vaccine are protected in the upper and lower respiratory tracts 
against infection by historical and contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV, 
and pre-emergent SHC014 and Pangolin/GD coronavirus strains. Using genetic and 
immunological approaches, we demonstrate that vaccine-induced protection 
unexpectedly is conferred principally by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated 
anamnestic responses. Importantly, prior mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 
respiratory infection does not alter the efficacy of the mucosally delivered 
pan-Sarbecovirus vaccine. These data highlight the promise of a phylogenetic 
approach for antigen and vaccine design against existing and pre-emergent 
Sarbecoviruses with pandemic potential.

Identifying the prevalence and risk factors of secondary human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) transmission from people living with HIV (PLWH) to other people is 
crucial for ending the HIV epidemic. However, the data among antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) patients is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and 
risk factors of secondary HIV transmission among PLWH receiving ART by 
longitudinal molecular networks in China. In this study, the prevalence of 
secondary HIV transmission was 10.8%. The R0 was greater than 1 from 2017 to 
2021 and peaked in 2019. PLWHs who were male sex, older age, engaged in 
condomless sex, experienced higher ART follow-up viral load, experienced ART 
medical omissions, infected with non-CRF01_AE subtype, and self-reported 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at HIV diagnosis increased the risk of 
secondary HIV transmission. However, those participants with higher education 
were less likely to be involved in secondary HIV transmission. The diagnostic 
age of the participants was nonlinearly associated with the risk of secondary 
HIV transmission, with a cutoff value of 43.13 years indicating a higher risk of 
secondary HIV transmission for patients diagnosed at or above this age. This 
study revealed substantial secondary HIV transmission and persistent HIV 
expansion among local PLWH, highlighting the necessity of enhancing viral load 
monitor, promoting adherence to ART, and promoting safe sex practices, 
particularly among older adults with HIV, to mitigate secondary HIV 
transmission.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of the gut microbiota with 
reproductive system diseases, including female infertility, male infertility, 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), primary ovarian failure, endometriosis, 
uterine fibroids, uterine polyps, sexual dysfunction, orchitis, and 
epididymitis.
METHODS: A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was 
performed to evaluate the potential causal relationship between the composition 
of gut microbiota and infertility, along with associated diseases.
RESULTS: Sixteen strong causal associations between gut microbes and 
reproductive system diseases were identified. Sixty-one causal associations 
between gut microbes and reproductive system diseases were determined. The genus 
Eubacterium hallii was a protective factor against premature ovarian failure and 
a pathogenic factor of endometriosis. The genus Erysipelatoclostridium was the 
pathogenic factor of many diseases, such as PCOS, endometriosis, epididymitis, 
and orchitis. The genus Intestinibacter is a pathogenic factor of male 
infertility and sexual dysfunction. The family Clostridiaceae 1 was a protective 
factor against uterine polyps and a pathogenic factor of orchitis and 
epididymitis. The results of reverse causal association analysis revealed that 
endometriosis, orchitis, and epididymitis all led to a decrease in the abundance 
of bifidobacteria and that female infertility-related diseases had a greater 
impact on gut microbes than male infertility-related diseases did.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the MR analysis indicate that there is a 
bidirectional causal relationship between the gut microbiota and infertility as 
well as associated ailments. Compared with ovarian diseases, uterine diseases 
are more likely to lead to changes in women's gut microbiota. The findings of 
this research offer valuable perspectives on the mechanism and clinical 
investigation of reproductive system diseases caused by microorganisms.

The early microbiota of neonates is crucial for developing the postnatal immune 
system and establishing normal physiological, metabolic, and neurological 
functions. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing the diversity 
of the neonatal oral microbiome, including mother-to-newborn microbial 
transmission. The study includes a prospective cohort comprising 73 mothers and 
87 neonates and a retrospective cohort comprising 991 mothers and 1,121 
neonates. Samples from the maternal cervix and neonatal gastric, bronchial, and 
oral cavities were analyzed using culture-based methods. Neonatal oral swab 
samples were also analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize 
microbial diversity and composition. Similar genera were detected in the 
neonatal gastric, bronchial, and oral samples, and the neonatal gastric culture 
was the most similar to the maternal cervical culture. In addition to 
mother-to-newborn microbial transmission, various natal factors including birth 
type, birth weight, delivery mode, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal diabetes 
and the presence of microbes in other sites influenced neonatal oral microbiome 
diversity. Among these factors, the birth type was the most significant, and 
preterm neonates exhibited decreased oral microbiome diversity, with fewer 
beneficial bacteria and more pathogens. These findings could serve as a baseline 
for research on the establishment of the oral microbiota in preterm neonates and 
its health implications.

Mosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like 
dengue virus and parasites such as Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of 
malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of 
mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections 
of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the 
vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. 
To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome 
manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection 
(MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and 
high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available, both isolates 
and sequence data, for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 
species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the Enterobacteriaceae 
comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of 3 genera, 
Enterobacter, Serratia, and Elizabethkingia, reveal lineages of 
mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in 
multiple laboratories. Investigation into species' pangenomes further reveals 
clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future 
work to test for functions connected to mosquito host association. Altogether, 
we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated 
bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in 
context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly 
valuable resource for research on bacterial colonisation and adaptation within 
mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader 
geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals 
collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, 
including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.

INTRODUCTION: Wastewater surveillance is an important technique to monitor 
public health and is being studied extensively for pandemic prevention, force 
health protection and readiness, and as a potential early warning system for 
chem-bio defense. Wastewater surveillance has traditionally relied on techniques 
such as quantitative PCR or targeted sequencing, both of which are microbe- or 
disease-specific tools. Newer pan-viral metagenomics strategies may provide 
higher specificity for pathogens of interest, resulting in a lower false 
negative rate and reduced sequencing of undesired background nucleic acids. One 
such system, VirCapSeq-VERT, has been developed to target all vertebrate virus 
pathogens; until recently, its application has been limited to clinical samples. 
The objective of this study was to use VirCapSeq-VERT to interrogate wastewater 
samples from the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Colorado Springs, Colorado, to 
determine its utility in assessing complex samples and its potential application 
in public health surveillance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biweekly samples were analyzed from February 2022 through 
May 2023. Samples were collected from the wastewater treatment facility at USAFA 
before treatment and stored at -20 °C until total nucleic acid (tNA: DNA and 
RNA) extraction. tNA was then subject to the probe-based capture system, 
VirCapSeq, and run through a collection of public bioinformatics pipelines to 
identify captured viral pathogens and perform phylogenetic analysis. It was 
determined by the USAFA IRB that the study was non-human subject research and 
was deemed exempt.
RESULTS: In total, 68 families of viruses were identified, comprising thousands 
of individual strains. This study focused on viruses responsible for 
gastrointestinal dysfunction as a test of the use of the VirCapSeq-VERT to 
identify human pathogenic viruses within a complex and highly enriched 
biological sample. Four enteric viruses dominated the wastewater samples, with 
Adenoviridae most prevalent before the cadet winter recess (December 17, 
2022-January 4, 2023) and Astroviridae most abundant thereafter.
CONCLUSION: Although gastroenteritis outbreaks at USAFA are commonly attributed 
to norovirus because of clinical presentation and the acute nature of the 
illness-often diagnosed and treated without confirmatory stool testing-this 
virus was not found in high prevalence in these wastewater samples. Among 
adenoviruses, F serotype 41 predominated, suggesting a role in gastrointestinal 
infections among the cadet population. Phylogenetic investigation of adenovirus 
and norovirus exposed common variants with seasonal distributions. These 
findings may prompt correlational studies to assess the clinical predictive 
capability of VirCapSeq-VERT and to determine the utility of wastewater 
monitoring as an outbreak early warning system.

BACKGROUND: The symbiotic gut microbiota is pivotal for human health, with its 
composition linked to various diseases and metabolic disorders. Despite its 
significance, there remains a gap in systematically evaluating how host 
phenotypes, such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI), influence gut 
microbiota.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted an analysis of the gut microbiota 
of 185 Chinese adults based on whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of fecal 
samples. Our investigation focused on assessing the effects of gender, age, and 
BMI on gut microbiota across three levels: diversity, gene/phylogenetic 
composition, and functional composition. Our findings suggest that these 
phenotypes have a minor impact on shaping the gut microbiome compared to 
enterotypes, they do not correlate significantly within- or between-sample 
diversity. We identified a substantial number of phenotype-associated genes and 
metagenomic linkage groups (MLGs), indicating variations in gut microflora 
composition. Specifically, we observed a decline in beneficial Firmicutes 
microbes, such as Eubacterium, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus 
spp., in both older individuals and those with higher BMI, while potentially 
harmful microbes like Erysipelotrichaceae, Subdoligranulum and Streptococcus 
spp. increased with age. Additionally, Blautia and Dorea spp. were found to 
increase with BMI, aligning with prior research. Surprisingly, individuals who 
were older or overweight exhibited a lack of Bacteroidetes, a dominant phylum in 
the human gut microbiota that includes opportunistic pathogens, while certain 
species of the well-known probiotics Bifidobacterium were enriched in these 
groups, suggesting a complex interplay of these bacteria warranting further 
investigation. Regarding gender, several gender-associated MLGs from 
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Clostridium and Akkermansia were enriched in 
females. Functional analysis revealed a multitude of phenotype-associated KEGG 
orthologs (KOs).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study underscores the influence of gender, age, 
and BMI on gut metagenomes, affecting both phylogenetic and functional 
composition. However, further investigation is needed to elucidate the precise 
roles of these bacteria, including both pathogens and probiotics.

BACKGROUND: Bats (Order Chiroptera) are an important reservoir of emerging 
zoonotic microbes, including viruses of public health concern such as 
henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and SARS-related coronaviruses. Despite the 
continued discovery of new viruses in bat populations, a significant proportion 
of these viral agents remain uncharacterized, highlighting the imperative for 
additional research aimed at elucidating their evolutionary relationship and 
taxonomic classification.
RESULTS: In order to delve deeper into the viral reservoir hosted by bats, the 
present study employed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze 
13,105 swab samples obtained from various locations in China. Analysis of 378 
sample pools revealed the presence of 846 vertebrate-associated viruses. 
Subsequent thorough examination, adhering to the International Committee on 
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) criteria for virus classification, identified a total 
of 120 putative viral species with the potential to emerge as novel viruses, 
comprising a total of 294 viral strains. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved 
genomic regions indicated the novel virus exhibited a diverse array of viral 
lineages and branches, some of which displayed close genetic relationships to 
known human and livestock pathogens, such as poxviruses and pestiviruses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates the breadth of DNA and RNA viruses harbored 
by bats, delineating several novel evolutionary lineages and offering 
significant contributions to virus taxonomy. Furthermore, the identification of 
hitherto unknown viruses with relevance to human and livestock health 
underscores the importance of this study in encouraging infectious disease 
monitoring and management efforts in both public health and veterinary contexts.

The environment serves as a significant reservoir of antimicrobial resistance 
(AMR) microbes and genes and is increasingly recognized as key source of 
clinical AMR. Modern human activities impose an additional burden on 
environmental AMR, promoting its transmission to clinical setting and posing a 
serious threat to human health and welfare. Therefore, a comprehensive review of 
AMR transmission from the environment to the clinic, along with proposed 
effective control strategies, is crucial. This review systematically summarized 
current research on the transmission of environmental AMR to clinical settings. 
Furthermore, the transmission pathways, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) 
mechanisms, as well as the influential drivers including triple planetary crisis 
that may facilitate AMR transfer from environmental species to clinical 
pathogens are highlighted. In response to the growing trend of AMR transmission, 
we propose insightful mitigation strategies under the One Health framework, 
integrating advanced surveillance and tracking technologies, interdisciplinary 
knowledge, multisectoral interventions, alongside multiple antimicrobial use and 
stewardship approaches to tacking development and spread of AMR.

Clostridioides difficile is a One Health pathogen found in humans, animals, and 
the environment, with food representing a potential transmission route. One 
Health studies are often limited to a single country or selected reservoirs and 
ribotypes. This study provides a varied and accessible collection of C. 
difficile isolates and sequencing data derived from human, animal, and food 
sources across 13 European countries. A total of 441 strains (human hospital- 
and community-associated cases n = 280, animal n = 96, food n = 65) were 
analysed by ribotyping, toxinotyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We 
detected 83 sequence types (STs), with ST11 (n = 80 isolates) and ST1 (n = 54 
isolates) being the most represented. Several STs included strains originating 
from all source combinations. Further genomic analysis confirmed close genetic 
relatedness in some of the STs. Additionally, the genomic analysis identified 10 
strains from cryptic clades (C-I to C-III) and 4 of them were mono-toxigenic 
possessing only a variant form of tcdA gene. Amongst 106 ribotypes, 10 were 
shared between all 3 sources and 68 were source-specific. Some ribotypes were 
only found at the intersection of human and food source (RT023, RT027), or 
between human and animal source (RT009, RT045, RT046). C. difficile ribotypes 
and STs in Europe were diverse. In this collection, some ribotypes showed 
potential association with food or animal transmission routes. C. difficile 
strains from divergent clades CI-III, currently emerging in the human 
population, were rare and mostly food-associated.Trial registration:

Deciphering the molecular communications along the gut-brain axis can help in 
understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and exploiting 
the gut microbiome for therapeutics. However, gut microbes and their metabolites 
have a multifaceted role in mediating both brain physiology and 
neurodegenerative pathology. There is a lack of understanding of how and when 
this role is tipped in neurodegenerative diseases and what are those 
contributing factors, both at local (gut) and distal (neuronal) levels, that 
drive this imbalance. Here we have reviewed the gut microbiome and its 
metabolites in the context of the gut-brain axis and summarized how different 
factors such as gut-microbial diversity, their metabolites, the role of the 
native immune system and the integrity of gut epithelial and blood-brain 
barriers are interconnected and collectively define the involvement of 
gut-microbiome in neurodegenerative pathologies. It also underlines the need for 
multidisciplinary tools and animal models to simultaneously reflect on many of 
these factors and to better correlate with clinical observations and data 
obtained from human biopsies and fecal samples. Harnessing the gut-brain axis 
will herald a paradigm shift in medicine for neurodegenerative diseases and 
aging, emphasizing the significance of the microbiome in the broader spectrum of 
health and disease.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe coinfections and iterative infections with 
respiratory viruses diagnosed over a 22-month period in 2021-2022 in public 
university hospitals of the second largest French city.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Respiratory virus infections were diagnosed by qPCR with 
the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 on nasopharyngeal swabs 
collected between 01/03/2021-31/10/2022 and sent for routine diagnosis purpose 
to our clinical microbiology-virology laboratory at public university hospitals 
of Marseille, Southern France.
RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from 17,689 patients were tested, of which 8,133 
(46 %) were positive for ≥1 respiratory virus and 1,255 (15%) were co-infected 
with ≥2 viruses including 213 (2.6 %) with 3-7 viruses. Among them, 1,005 (80 %) 
were younger than 5 years, and mean age was significantly lower for coinfected 
than monoinfected patients (6.6 versus 23.8 years; p < 0.0001). Viruses with the 
highest confection rates were HBoV (97 %), HPeV (97 %), EV (92 %), ADV (68 %), 
and HCoV-HKU1 (63 %). Iterative infections were observed in 96 patients and they 
involved 10 different viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study points out that coinfections with respiratory viruses 
vary over time in prevalence, involve majoritarily young children, and may 
involve concurrent acute infections or acute-on-chronic infections, which 
deserves further specific studies.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency and 
hyperglycemia, and its incidence is increasing year by year. The pathogenesis of 
T1DM is complex, mainly including genetic and environmental factors. Intestinal 
flora is the largest microbial community in the human body and plays a very 
important role in human health and disease. In recent years, more and more 
studies have shown that intestinal flora and its metabolites, as an 
environmental factor, regulate the development of T1DM through various 
mechanisms such as altering the intestinal mucosal barrier, influencing insulin 
secretion and body immune regulation. Intestinal flora transplantation, 
probiotic supplementation, and other approaches to modulate the intestinal flora 
appear to be potential therapeutic approaches for T1DM. This article reviews the 
dysbiosis of the intestinal flora in T1DM, the potential mechanisms by which the 
intestinal flora affects T1DM, as well as discusses potential approaches to 
treating T1DM by intervening in the intestinal flora.

Linear waste management systems are unsustainable and contribute to 
environmental degradation, economic inequity, and health disparities. Among the 
array of environmental challenges stemming from anthropogenic impacts, the 
management of human excrement (human feces and urine) stands as a significant 
concern. Over two billion people do not have access to adequate sanitation, 
signifying a global public health crisis. Composting is the microbial 
biotechnology aimed at cycling organic waste, including human excrement, for 
improved public health, agricultural productivity and safety, and environmental 
sustainability. Applications of modern microbiome -omics and related 
technologies have the capacity to support continued advances in composting 
science and praxis. In this article, we review literature focused on 
applications of microbiome technologies to study composting systems and 
reactions. The studies we survey generally fall into the categories of animal 
manure composting, biosolids composting, and human excrement composting. We 
review experiments utilizing microbiome technologies to investigate strategies 
for enhancing pathogen suppression and accelerating the biodegradation of 
organic matter. Additionally, we explore studies focused on the bioengineering 
potential of microbes as inoculants to facilitate degradation of toxins such as 
pharmaceuticals or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The findings from these 
studies underscore the importance of advancing our understanding of composting 
processes through the integration of emerging microbiome -omics technologies. We 
conclude that work to-date has demonstrated exciting basic and applied science 
potential from studying compost microbiomes, with promising implications for 
enhancing global environmental sustainability and public health.

Introduction: Microbiota, composed of micro-organisms like bacteria, viruses, 
and non-pathogenic fungi, plays a crucial role in digestion, vitamin production, 
and protection against dangerous microbes. Several factors, including age, diet, 
alcohol consumption, stress, environmental microorganisms, and therapies 
(particularly antibiotics), as well as birth and nursing, could modify the 
microbiota. Recent research has highlighted its alteration and involvement in a 
various disease, including metabolic syndrome and acne. This systematic review 
aimed to identify common biomarkers and microbiota alterations shared between 
metabolic syndrome and acne, and to explore how the potential prebiotic 
activities of polyphenols may promote intestinal eubiosis. Materials and 
methods: A comprehensive search in PubMed and EMBASE resulted in 4142 articles, 
from which nine studies were selected based on specific criteria after removing 
duplicates and reviewing abstracts and full texts. All studies correlated the 
microbiota alteration in both pathologies and the activity of polyphenols in 
metabolic syndrome. Results: This review suggests that acne may be influenced by 
some of the same microorganisms involved in metabolic syndrome. While the 
literature highlights the effectiveness of polyphenols in treating metabolic 
syndrome, no studies have yet demonstrated their specific impact on acne. 
Conclusions: The research points to the potential benefits of polyphenols in 
modulating the microbiota, which could be relevant for individuals with 
metabolic syndrome. However, due to the limited data available, it was not 
possible to establish a direct correlation between metabolic syndrome and acne.

What Is a Biofilm? Lessons Learned from Interactions with Immune Cells.

Krzyżek P(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, 
50-368 Wroclaw, Poland.

Biofilms are unique, multicellular life forms that challenge our understanding 
of the microbial functioning. The last decades of research on biofilms have 
allowed us to better understand their importance in the context of both health 
and various pathologies in the human body, although many knowledge gaps 
hindering their correct comprehension still exist. Biofilms are classically 
described as mushroom-shaped structures attached to the substrate; however, an 
increasing body of evidence shows that their morphology in clinical conditions 
may differ significantly from that classically presented. Although this may 
result partly from the unique physicochemical conditions within the host, the 
interaction between microbes and immune cells during development of a biofilm 
should not be underestimated. The current Opinion confronts the classical view 
on biofilms with the latest scientific research describing the vitality of 
interactions with immune cells as a modulator of the biofilm phenotype and 
behavior in clinical conditions.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common gastrointestinal 
malignancy worldwide, with obesity-induced lipid metabolism disorders playing a 
crucial role in its progression. A complex connection exists between gut 
microbiota and the development of intestinal tumors through the microbiota 
metabolite pathway. Metabolic disorders frequently alter the gut microbiome, 
impairing immune and cellular functions and hastening cancer progression.
METHODS: This study thoroughly examined the gut microbiota through 16S rRNA 
sequencing of fecal samples from 181 CRC patients, integrating preoperative 
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and RNA sequencing data. The 
study includes a comparison of microbial diversity, differential microbiological 
analysis, exploration of the associations between microbiota, tumor 
microenvironment immune cells, and immune genes, enrichment analysis of 
potential biological functions of microbe-related host genes, and the prediction 
of LDL-C status through microorganisms.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that differences in α and β diversity indices of 
intestinal microbiota in CRC patients were not statistically significant across 
different LDL-C metabolic states. Patients exhibited varying LDL-C metabolic 
conditions, leading to a bifurcation of their gut microbiota into two distinct 
clusters. Patients with LDL-C metabolic irregularities had higher concentrations 
of twelve gut microbiota, which were linked to various immune cells and 
immune-related genes, influencing tumor immunity. Under normal LDL-C metabolic 
conditions, the protective microorganism Anaerostipes_caccae was significantly 
negatively correlated with the GO Biological Process pathway involved in the 
negative regulation of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic 
reticulum. Both XGBoost and MLP models, developed using differential gut 
microbiota, could forecast LDL-C levels in CRC patients biologically.
CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal microbiota in CRC patients influences the LDL-C 
metabolic status. With elevated LDL-C levels, gut microbiota can regulate the 
function of immune cells and gene expression within the tumor microenvironment, 
affecting cancer-related pathways and promoting CRC progression. LDL-C and its 
associated gut microbiota could provide non-invasive markers for clinical 
evaluation and treatment of CRC patients.

Human excreta-derived fertilizers (HEDFs) are organic fertilizers made from 
human excreta sources such as urine and feces. HEDFs can contribute to a 
sustainable and circular agriculture by reuse of valuable nutrients that would 
otherwise be discarded. However, HEDFs may contain contaminants such as 
pharmaceuticals, persistent organic compounds, heavy metals and pathogens which 
can negatively affect plant, water and soil quality. Moreover, consumer 
prejudice, farmer hesitance and strict regulations can discourage utilization of 
HEDFs. Here, we conducted a thorough review of published literature to explore 
the opportunities and challenges of using HEDFs in agricultural systems by 
evaluating the suitability of human excreta as a nutrient source, their typical 
contaminant composition, how they affect the quality of crops, soils and water 
and their societal impact and acceptance. We found that HEDFs are suitable 
nutrient-rich fertilizers, but may contain contaminants. Processing treatments 
increase the fertilizer quality by reducing these contaminants, but they do not 
remove all contaminants completely. Regarding the environmental impacts of these 
fertilizers, we found overall positive effects on crop yield, soil nutrients, 
plant-soil-microbe interactions and plant pathogen suppression. The use of HEDFs 
reduces water contamination from sewage waste dumping, but nutrient leaching 
dependent on soil type may still affect water quality. We found no increased 
risks with human pathogens compared to inorganic fertilizers but identified 
processing treatment as well as crop and soil type significantly affect these 
risks. Lastly, we found that public acceptance is possible with clear 
regulations and outreach to inform consumers and farmers of their multi-faceted 
benefits and safe usage after processing treatments. In summary, this review 
emphasizes the great potential of HEDFs and its positive impacts on society, 
especially in regions where conventional fertilizers are scarce, while also 
stressing the need for adaptation to specific soils and crops.

The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a complex microbial ecosystem, 
the gut microbiota, which is pivotal in maintaining host health and mediating 
resistance to diseases. This review delineates colonization resistance (CR), a 
critical defensive mechanism employed by the gut microbiota to safeguard against 
pathogenic bacterial invasions, notably by Salmonella. We detail the mechanisms 
through which the gut microbiota impedes Salmonella colonization, including 
nutrient competition, production of antimicrobial peptides, synthesis of 
microbial-derived metabolites, and modulation of the host immune response. 
Additionally, we examine how dietary interventions can influence these 
mechanisms, thereby augmenting the protective role of the gut microbiota. The 
review also discusses the sophisticated strategies utilized by Salmonella to 
overcome these microbial defenses. A thorough understanding of these complex 
interactions between microbial symbionts and pathogens is crucial for the 
development of innovative therapeutic strategies that enhance CR, aiming to 
prevent or treat microbial infections effectively.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium associated with a wide range 
of community- and hospital-acquired infections. The emergence of clonal 
hypervirulent strains resistant to last-resort antimicrobial agents has become a 
global concern. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with its diverse population 
and high tourism traffic, serves as a platform where the spread of 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains are facilitated. However, the knowledge of 
epidemiology and population diversity of MDR K. pneumoniae in KSA is scarce. We 
conducted a comprehensive genomic survey on 352 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates 
systematically collected from bloodstream and urinary tract infections in 34 
hospitals across 15 major cities in KSA during 2022 and 2023. Whole-genome 
sequencing on the isolates was performed, followed by genomic epidemiology and 
phylodynamic analysis. Our study revealed a dynamic population characterized by 
the rapid expansion of several dominant clones, including, ST2096, ST147, and 
ST231, which were estimated to have emerged within the past decade. These clones 
exhibited widespread dissemination across hospitals and were genetically linked 
to global strains, particularly from the Middle East and South Asia. All major 
clones harboured plasmid-borne ESBLs and carbapenemase genes, with plasmidome 
analysis identifying multiple IncH, IncA/C and IncL plasmids underlying the 
MDR-hypervirulent phenotype. These plasmids were shared between major clones and 
became acquired on the same time scales as the expansion of the dominant clones. 
Our results report ST2096 as an emerging MDR-hypervirulent clone, emphasizing 
the need for monitoring of the circulating clones and their plasmid content in 
the KSA and broader West Asia.

The nucleoprotein (NP) of type A influenza virus (IAV) is highly conserved 
across all virus strains, making it an attractive candidate antigen for 
universal vaccines. While various studies have explored NP-induced mucosal 
immunity, here we interrogated the mechanistic differences between intramuscular 
(IM) and intranasal (IN) delivery of a recombinant adenovirus carrying NP fused 
with a bifunctional CD40 ligand. Despite being less effective than IM delivery 
in inducing systemic cellular immune responses and antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), IN immunization elicited superior antigen-specific recall 
humoral and cellular response in the nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) of 
the upper respiratory tract, the initial site of immune recognition and 
elimination of inhaled pathogens. IN vaccination also induced significantly 
stronger pulmonary T cell responses in the lower respiratory tract than IM 
vaccination, in particular the CD8 T cells. Moreover, blocking lymphocyte 
circulation abrogated IM but not IN immunization induced protection, 
illustrating the critical role of local memory immune response upon viral 
infection. Notably, the CD40-targeted nasal delivery not only improved the 
magnitude but also the breadth of protection, including against lethal challenge 
with a newly isolated highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain. These findings are 
informative for the design of universal mucosal vaccines, where the predominant 
mode of protection is independent of neutralizing antibodies.

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract quickly becomes densely populated with 
foreign microorganisms shortly after birth, thereby establishing a lifelong 
presence of a microbial community. These commensal gut microbiota serve various 
functions, such as providing nutrients, processing ingested compounds, 
maintaining gut homeostasis, and shaping the intestinal structure in the host. 
Dysbiosis, which is characterized by an imbalance in the microbial community, is 
closely linked to numerous human ailments and has recently emerged as a key 
factor in health prognosis. Tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious and 
potentially fatal disease, presents a pressing need for improved methods of 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Thus, we aim to explore the 
latest developments on how the host's immune defenses, inflammatory responses, 
metabolic pathways, and nutritional status collectively impact the host's 
susceptibility to or resilience against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. 
The review addresses how the fluctuations in the gut microbiota not only affect 
the equilibrium of these physiological processes but also indirectly influence 
the host's capacity to resist M. tuberculosis. This work highlights the central 
role of the gut microbiota in the host-microbe interactions and provides novel 
insights for the advancement of preventative and therapeutic approaches against 
tuberculosis.

Undernutrition in children commonly disrupts the structure and function of the 
small intestinal microbial community, leading to enteropathies, compromised 
metabolic health, and impaired growth and development. The mechanisms by which 
diet and microbes mediate the balance between commensal and pathogenic 
intestinal flora remain elusive. In a murine model of undernutrition, we 
investigated the direct interactions Giardia lamblia, a prevalent small 
intestinal pathogen, on indigenous microbiota and specifically on Lactobacillus 
strains known for their mucosal and growth homeostatic properties. Our research 
reveals that Giardia colonization shifts the balance of lactic acid bacteria, 
causing a relative decrease in Lactobacillus spp. and an increase in 
Bifidobacterium spp. This alteration corresponds with a decrease in multiple 
indicators of mucosal and nutritional homeostasis. Additionally, 
protein-deficient conditions coupled with Giardia infection exacerbate the rise 
of primary bile acids and susceptibility to bile acid-induced intestinal barrier 
damage. In epithelial cell monolayers, Lactobacillus spp. mitigated bile 
acid-induced permeability, showing strain-dependent protective effects. In vivo, 
L. plantarum, either alone or within a Lactobacillus spp consortium, facilitated 
growth in protein-deficient mice, an effect attenuated by Giardia, despite not 
inhibiting Lactobacillus colonization. These results highlight Giardia's 
potential role as a disruptor of probiotic functional activity, underscoring the 
imperative for further research into the complex interactions between parasites 
and bacteria under conditions of nutritional deficiency.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are hotspots for pathogens, and can 
facilitate horizontal gene transfer, potentially releasing harmful genetic 
material and antimicrobial resistance genes into the environment. Little 
information exists on the composition and behavior of microbes in WWTPs, 
especially in developing countries. This study used environmental DNA (eDNA) 
techniques to examine the microbiome load of wastewater from WWTPs. The DNA was 
isolated from wastewater samples collected from the treatment trains of three 
WWTPs in Kimberley, South Africa, and the microbial diversity and composition 
was compared through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The microbes detected were of 
the Kingdom Bacteria, and of these, 48.27% were successfully identified to genus 
level. The majority of reads from the combined bacterial data fall within the 
class Gammaproteobacteria, which is known to adversely impact ecological and 
human health. Arcobacteraceae constituted 19% of the bacterial reads, which is 
expected as this family is widespread in aquatic environments. Interestingly, 
the most abundant bacterial group was Bacteroides, which contain a variety of 
antibiotic-resistant members. Overall, various antibiotic-resistant taxa were 
detected in the wastewater, indicating a concerning level of antibiotic 
resistance within the bacterial community. Therefore, eDNA analysis can be a 
valuable tool in monitoring and assessing the bacterial microbiome in 
wastewater, thus providing important information for the optimization and 
improvement of wastewater treatment systems and mitigate public health risks.

Bioaerosols are ubiquitous and have a substantial impact on the atmosphere and 
human health. Despite the identification of numerous bioaerosol emission 
sources, the contribution of anthropogenic sources remains inadequately 
understood. In kitchens, oil stains accumulated at the vent may discharge 
microorganisms into the environment with airflow, potentially discharging 
bioaerosol pollution. This putative anthropogenic source of bioaerosols has been 
long ignored. To investigated whether kitchen chimneys can be a potential source 
for bioaerosols, air samples, oil stains from in/out chimneys, and surface sand 
samples were collected near several commercial restaurants. PCoA showed that 
sampling sites significantly impacted microbiomes, whereas SourceTracker 
analysis led to the finding that waste grease significantly contributed to 
bioaerosol composition. Both findings agree with the kitchen chimney as a source 
of microbes in bioaerosols in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, despite 
the low biodiversity, a high proportion of stress-tolerant and potential 
pathogenic bacteria and fungi were found in residual culinary grease, which may 
escape into the air causing potential risks to human beings. These results led 
to the proposal that airborne microbiota can originate from cooking waste 
grease. Immediate actions should be taken into account to enhance disinfection 
and sterilization aimed at fume vents.

The human gut microbiota, the vast community of microbes inhabiting the 
gastrointestinal tract, plays a pivotal role in maintaining health. Bacteria are 
the most abundant organism, and the composition of bacterial communities is 
strongly influenced by diet. Gut bacteria can degrade complex dietary 
carbohydrates to produce bioactive compounds such as short-chain fatty acids. 
Such products influence health, by acting on systemic metabolism, or by virtue 
of anti-inflammatory or anti-carcinogenic properties. The composition of gut 
bacteria can be altered through overgrowth of enteropathogens (e.g., 
Campylobacter, Salmonella spp.), leading to dysbiosis of the gut ecosystem, with 
some species thriving under the altered conditions whereas others decline. 
Various "biotics" strategies, including prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and 
postbiotics, contribute to re-establishing balance within the gut microbial 
ecosystem conferring health benefits. Prebiotics enhance growth of beneficial 
members of the resident microbial community and can thus prevent pathogen growth 
by competitive exclusion. Specific probiotics can actively inhibit the growth of 
pathogens, either through the production of bacteriocins or simply by reducing 
the gastrointestinal pH making conditions less favorable for pathogen growth. 
This review discusses the importance of a balanced gut ecosystem, and strategies 
to maintain it that contribute to human health.

Several human fungal pathogens, including drug-resistant Candida auris and 
species of the Candida haemulonii complex, have emerged over the past two 
decades, posing new threats to human health. In this study, we report the 
isolation and identification of a novel species belonging to the genus 
Clavispora, herein named as Cl avispora sputum, from a clinical sputum sample of 
a COVID-19 patient. Cl . sputum is phylogenetically closely related to fungal 
pathogens Clavispora lusitaniae (syn. Candida lusitaniae) and C. auris. When 
grown on CHROMagar Candida Plus medium, Cl. sputum exhibited a similar 
coloration to C. auris strain CBS12372. Cl. sputum was able to develop weak 
filaments on CM medium. Although Cl. sputum and Cl. lusitaniae are 
phylogenetically closely related, comparative genomic and synteny analyses 
indicated significant chromosomal rearrangements between the two species. 
Although Cl. sputum could not grow at 37 °C under regular culture condition, an 
increased fungal burden in the lung tissue of a mouse systemic infection model 
implies that it could be a potential opportunistic pathogenic yeast in humans.

Polymicrobial diseases such as periodontal disease and caries pose significant 
treatment challenges due to their resistance to common approaches like 
antibiotic therapy. These infections exhibit increased resilience, due to 
microbial interactions that also disrupt host immune responses. Current research 
focuses on virulence and disease-promoting interactions, but less is known about 
interactions that could inhibit or prevent disease development. Normally 
human-associated microbiomes maintain homeostasis, preventing pathobionts from 
becoming dominant. In conditions like chronic disseminated candidiasis or severe 
early childhood caries (s-ECC), an overgrowth of microbes such as Candida 
albicans disrupts this balance. Typically, C. albicans coexists benignly within 
the microbial community but can become pathogenic, forming biofilms and 
interacting with other microbes such as cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. This 
interaction is particularly significant in s-ECC, where it exacerbates the 
disease's progression and severity. Here, we present that Corynebacterium durum, 
itself and through its extracellular membrane vesicles disrupts interkingdom 
assemblages between C. albicans and S. mutans. Mechanistically the interaction 
interference occurs at the genetic level with downregulated HWP1 expression, a 
surface protein specifically induced in the presence of S. mutans promoting the 
interkingdom interaction. Additionally, we show that C. durum can impede C. 
albicans systemic virulence in the Galleria mellonella infection model. This 
suggests that oral corynebacteria may act as a beneficial commensal species, 
exerting antifungal effects within polymicrobial communities and opening new 
avenues for managing polymicrobial diseases.IMPORTANCEPolymicrobial diseases 
such as severe early childhood caries (s-ECC) lack effective treatment options. 
Prevention, requiring a deeper understanding of ecological processes before the 
onset of disease symptoms, could be a potential strategy. In this context, we 
investigated how relatively abundant oral biofilm Corynebacterium species, which 
are associated with oral health, can interfere with the interkingdom partnership 
of Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. This partnership is a significant 
driver of tooth decay in s-ECC due to synergistic activities that increase 
cariogenicity. Our study reveals that oral corynebacteria, through the 
production of extracellular membrane vesicles, can disrupt the S. mutans and C. 
albicans partnership by inhibiting fungal hyphae formation. Additionally, the 
fatty acid cargo within these vesicles exhibits antifungal properties, 
suggesting that corynebacteria play a role in shaping microbial dynamics within 
the oral biofilm.

Tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a 
significant health problem worldwide. Here, we developed a method to detect 
large insertions and deletions (indels), which have been generally understudied. 
Leveraging this framework, we performed a comprehensive analysis of single 
nucleotide variants and small and large indels across 1,960 Mtb clinical 
isolates. Comparing the distribution of variants demonstrated that gene 
disruptive variants are underrepresented in genes essential for bacterial 
survival. An evolutionary analysis revealed that Mtb genomes are enriched in 
partially deleterious mutations. Genome-wide association studies identified 
small and large deletions in eccB2 significantly associated with patient 
prognosis. Additionally, we unveil significant associations with antibiotic 
resistance in 23 non-canonical genes. Among these, large indels are primarily 
found in genetic regions of Rv1216c, Rv1217c, fadD11, and ctpD. This study 
provides a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations and highlights their 
potential impact for the future treatment and risk prediction of tuberculosis.

The continual emergence of highly pathogenic novel coronaviruses and their 
variants has underscored the importance of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) as a pivotal therapeutic approach. In the present study, we report the 
specific neutralizing antibodies 13H7 and 9G11, which target the N-terminal 
domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2, respectively. 
The comparative analysis observed that 13H7 not only neutralizes early variants 
of concern (VOCs) but also exhibits neutralizing activity against the Omicron 
sublineage, including BA.4, BA.5, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1. 9G11, as an RBD antibody, 
also demonstrated remarkable neutralizing efficacy. A cocktail antibody 
combining 13H7 and 9G11 with the previously reported 3E2 broaden the 
neutralization spectrum against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2. We elucidated 
the cryo-EM structure of the complex, clarifying the mechanism of action of the 
cocktail antibody combination. Additionally, we also emphasized the molecular 
mechanism between 13H7 and SARS-CoV-2 NTD, revealing the impact of Y144 and H146 
residue deletions and mutations on the neutralizing efficacy of 13H7. Taken 
together, our findings not only offer novel insights into the combination 
therapy of NTD and RBD neutralizing mAbs but also lay a theoretical foundation 
for the development of vaccines targeting NTD antibodies, thus providing 
valuable understanding of alleviating the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

An increasing trend in zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) has been 
observed worldwide. Most EID outbreaks originate from wildlife, and these 
outbreaks often involve pathogen-host-environment interaction. Garbage dumps act 
as an interface between humans, animals, and the environment, from which EIDs 
could arise. Therefore, this review considers the presence of important 
pathogens associated with animals and vectors at garbage dumps from a One Health 
perspective, looking at animal, human, and environmental factors that play a 
role. A narrative review was performed focusing on four key points, including 
garbage dumps, animals, waste pickers, zoonoses and EIDs. Articles addressing 
the presence of terrestrial animals, insects in garbage dumps, and infectious 
diseases among waste pickers were included in this study. There were 345 
relevant articles covering 395 species of terrestrial animals and insects, 
consisting of 4 species of amphibians, 180 species of birds, 84 species of 
insects, 114 species of mammals, and 13 species of reptiles. Furthermore, 97 
articles (28.12 %) addressed pathogens found in those populations. About half of 
the articles were interested in bacterial diseases (52.58 %), followed by 
parasitic diseases (30.93 %) and viral diseases (30.93 %). Zoonotic pathogens 
were described in 53.6 % of all articles, while 19.59 % focused on 
drug-resistant microbes, 13.40 % on rodent-borne diseases, and 7.21 % on 
vector-borne diseases. Garbage dumps would play a role in the emergence of 
diseases. The relevant factors at garbage dumps that may increase the risk of 
disease emergence include increased animal populations and density, increased 
vector population, newly evolved strains of pathogens, increased interaction 
between humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and vectors, and socio-economic 
factors. Therefore, sustainable waste management will reduce waste generation, 
and improve waste collection, and disposal which helps reduce the emergence of 
new diseases.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica is a serious threat to human health. It 
causes damage to the intestine and liver. Probiotic therapy has been shown to be 
effective in alleviating intestinal diseases and improving host health. Previous 
studies have found that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens could alleviate the 
pathological symptoms of schistosomiasis japonica, but the regulatory mechanism 
of alleviating schistosomiasis japonica is still unknown.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study analyzed the dynamic changes of intestinal 
microbiome in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum after the intervention of 
B. amyloliquefaciens and its connection to host metabolism by multi-omics 
sequencing technology. B. amyloliquefaciens was found to significantly regulate 
the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota by promoting the growth of beneficial 
bacteria and inhibiting potential pathogenic bacteria and protect the number of 
core microbes. Meanwhile, the genes related to the metabolism of 
glycerophospholipids and amino acid from intestinal microbiome changed 
significantly, and were shown to be significantly positively correlated with the 
associated metabolites of microbial origin. Moreover, host metabolism (lipid 
metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis) was also found to be significantly 
regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: The recovery of intestinal microbial homeostasis and the regulation 
of host metabolism revealed the potential probiotic properties of B. 
amyloliquefaciens, which also provided new ideas for the prevention and adjuvant 
treatment of schistosomiasis japonica.

BACKGROUND: Colobines are primarily leaf-eating primates, depend on microbiota 
of gastrointestinal tracts for food digestion. However, the gut microbiota of 
Malaysia's colobines specifically langurs remains unstudied.
AIMS: Hence, we aim to analyze the fecal microbiomes of Malaysia's langurs using 
Presbytis femoralis, Presbytis robinsoni, Trachypithecus obscurus, and 
Trachypithecus cristatus from various landscapes as models.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected samples from all four species across several 
areas in Peninsular Malaysia and performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon 
sequencing using the Illumina sequencing platform.
RESULTS: Presbytis femoralis exhibited the highest bacterial diversity, followed 
by T. obscurus, T. cristatus, P. robinsoni and the lowest, P. siamensis. Over 11 
million operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across Malaysia's 
langurs spanning 26 phyla, 180 families, and 329 genera of microbes. The OTUs 
were dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. There are 11 
genera of pathogenic bacteria were identified across all host species. Nine 
pathogenic bacterial genera inhabit both T. obscurus, indicating poor health due 
to low bacterial diversity and heightened pathogenicity. In contrast, P. 
robinsoni with the fewest pathogenic species is deemed the healthiest among 
Malaysia's langurs.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that alterations in diet, behavior, and 
habitat affect bacterial diversity in Malaysia's langurs' gut microbiota. Even 
though this is the first comprehensive analysis of langur microbiomes in 
Malaysia, it is important to note the limitations regarding the number of 
samples, populations sampled, and the geographical origins and landscapes of 
these populations. Our results suggest that Malaysia's langurs may harbor 
pathogenic bacteria, potentially posing a risk of transmission to humans.
CONCLUSION: This highlights the critical need for the conservation and 
management of Malaysia's langurs, particularly considering their interactions 
with humans. This data can serve as a foundation for authorities to inform the 
public about the origins and significance of animal health and the management of 
zoonotic diseases.

This study investigated antimicrobial resistance in the anaerobic digesters of 
two industrial-scale biogas plants processing agricultural biomass and municipal 
wastewater sludge. A combination of deep sequencing and genome-centric workflow 
was implemented for metagenomic and metatranscriptomics data analysis to 
comprehensively examine potential antimicrobial resistance in microbial 
communities. Anaerobic microbes were found to harbour numerous antibiotic 
resistance genes (ARGs), with 58.85% of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) 
harbouring antibiotic resistance. A moderately positive correlation was observed 
between the abundance and expression of ARGs. ARGs were located primarily on 
bacterial chromosomes. A higher expression of resistance genes was observed on 
plasmids than on chromosomes. Risk index assessment suggests that most ARGs 
identified posed a significant risk to human health. However, potentially 
pathogenic bacteria showed lower ARG expression than non-pathogenic ones, 
indicating that anaerobic treatment is effective against pathogenic microbes. 
Resistomes at the gene category level were associated with various antibiotic 
resistance categories, including multidrug resistance, beta-lactams, 
glycopeptides, peptides, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS). 
Differential expression analysis revealed specific genes associated with 
potential pathogenicity, emphasizing the importance of active gene expression in 
assessing the risks associated with ARGs.

The presence of pathogens is one of the leading causes of stream water quality 
impairment in the US. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a fecal pathogen indicator 
and also signals the presence of more pathogenic microbes. Although it is 
reported that Black, Indigenous, and communities of color suffer more from E. 
coli contamination, there is a lack of investigation of the potential inequality 
of E. coli contamination in recreational waterbodies, particularly regarding 
whether this inequality persists over the long term. Using E. coli monitoring 
data from 1,424 stations from 2001 to 2021 in Texas, we tested the research 
hypotheses of racial and economic inequalities in E. coli levels and trends with 
quantile regression and logistic regression approaches. We found that economic 
disparities had a more significant relationship with E. coli contamination in 
Texas recreational waterbodies than racial disparities after controlling for 
building age, land covers, imperviousness, and precipitation. The economic 
disparities in E. coli contamination were more prevalent after 2010 and in 
extreme E. coli levels. In addition, implementing watershed protection plans 
could mitigate the economic disparities associated with the rising trend of E. 
coli levels between 2001 and 2021. Findings from this research underscore clean 
surface water deprivation from underserved communities and call for inclusive 
watershed management strategies to address the water quality injustice.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant microbial species has become a global 
health concern, calling for novel antimicrobial agents. Peptoids, a class of 
synthetic peptidomimetics with unique structural properties, exhibit 
antimicrobial activity against a broad-spectrum of microbes, in addition to 
their stability to enzymatic degradation, selectivity, and relative ease of 
synthesis. Thus, peptoids have great potential in combating various 
drug-resistant pathogenic microbes. This review provides a comprehensive 
analysis of the recent advances in utilizing peptoids as effective antimicrobial 
agents against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. In 
addition, some of the synthetic strategies and antimicrobial mechanisms are 
discussed. The imperfections of antimicrobial peptoids and the defects in 
current antimicrobial peptoids research are pointed out and promising directions 
for future development in peptoids are highlighted, to pave the way for

Nigella sativa (N. sativa; Ranunculaceae), commonly referred to as black cumin, 
is one of the most widely used medicinal plants worldwide, with its seeds having 
numerous applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. With the 
emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens as an important health 
challenge, the need for alternative microbe-inhibitory agents is on the rise, 
whereby black cumin has gained considerable attention from researchers for its 
strong antimicrobial characteristics owing to its high content in a wide range 
of bioactive compounds, including thymoquinone, nigellimine, nigellidine, 
quercetin, and O-cymene. Particularly, thymoquinone increases the levels of 
antioxidant enzymes that counter oxidative stress in the liver. Additionally, 
the essential oil in N. sativa seeds effectively inhibits intestinal parasites 
and shows moderate activity against some bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis 
and Staphylococcus aureus. Thymoquinone exhibits minimum inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) of 8-16 μg/mL against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) and exhibits MIC 0.25 µg/mL against drug-resistant mycobacteria. 
Similarly, quercetin shows a MIC of 2 mg/mL against oral pathogens, such as 
Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Furthermore, endophytic 
fungi isolated from N. sativa have demonstrated antibacterial activity. 
Therefore, N. sativa is a valuable medicinal plant with potential for medicinal 
and food-related applications. In-depth exploration of the corresponding 
therapeutic potential and scope of industrial application warrants further 
research.

While considerable progress has been made in understanding the complex 
relationships between gut microbiomes and their hosts, especially in mammals and 
humans, the functions of these microbial communities in avian species remain 
largely unexplored. This gap in knowledge is particularly notable, given the 
critical roles gut microbiomes are known to play in facilitating crucial 
physiological functions, such as digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune 
system development. Corvidae birds are omnivorous and widely distributed across 
various habitats, exhibiting strong adaptability and often displaying the traits 
of accompanying humans. However, to date, information on species composition, 
sequenced genomes, and functional characteristics of crow gut microbes is 
lacking. Herein, we constructed the first relatively comprehensive crows gut 
microbial gene catalog (2.74 million genes) and 195 high-quality and 
medium-quality metagenome-assembled genomes using 53 metagenomic samples from 
five typical crow species (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, Corvus dauuricus, Corvus 
frugilegus, Corvus macrorhynchos, and Corvus corax) on the Qinghai-Tibetan 
Plateau. The species composition of gut microbiota at the phylum and genus 
levels was revealed for these five crow species. Simultaneously, numerous types 
of prevalent pathogenic bacteria were identified, indicating the potential of 
these crows to transmit diseases within the local community. At the functional 
level, we annotated a total of 356 KEGG functional pathways, six CAZyme 
categories, and 3607 virulence factor genes in the gut microbiomes of the crows. 
The gut microbiota of five distinct crow species underwent a comparative 
analysis, which uncovered significant differences in their composition, 
diversity, and functional structures. Over 36% of MAGs showed no overlap with 
existing databases, suggesting they might represent new species. Consequently, 
these findings enriched the dataset of microbial genomes associated with crows' 
digestive systems. Overall, this study offers crucial baseline information 
regarding the gut microbial gene catalog and genomes in crows, potentially 
aiding microbiome-based research, as well as an evaluation of the health risks 
to humans from the bacterial pathogens transmitted by wild birds.

Public spaces in countries with limited societal development can be contaminated 
with feces containing pathogenic microbes from animals and people. Data on 
contamination levels, spatial distribution, and the diversity of enteric 
pathogens in the public settings of low- and middle-income neighborhoods are 
crucial for devising strategies that minimize the enteric infection burden. The 
objective of this study was to compare spatial-temporal differences in the 
detection rate and diversity of enteric pathogens in the public spaces of low- 
and middle-income neighborhoods of Nairobi, Kenya. TaqMan array card (TAC) 
molecular assays were employed to analyze soil samples for 19 enteropathogens, 
along with a selective bacterial culture for pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. An 
observational assessment was conducted during every site visit to document the 
hygienic infrastructure and sanitation conditions at the sites. We detected at 
least one pathogen in 79% (127/160) and ≥2 pathogens in 67.5% (108/160) of the 
soil samples tested. The four most frequently detected pathogens were EAEC 
(67.5%), ETEC (59%), EPEC (57.5%), and STEC (31%). The detection rate (91% vs. 
66%) and mean number of enteric pathogens (5 vs. 4.7) were higher in low-income 
Kibera than in middle-income Jericho. The more extensive spatial distribution of 
pathogens in Kibera resulted in increases in the detection of different enteric 
pathogens from within-site (area < 50 m2) and across-site (across-neighborhood) 
movements compared to Jericho. The pathogen detection rates fluctuated 
seasonally in Jericho but remained at sustained high levels in Kibera. While 
better neighborhood conditions were linked with lower pathogen detection rates, 
pathogenic E. coli remained prevalent in the public environment across both 
neighborhoods. Future studies should focus on identifying how the sources of 
pathogen contamination are modified by improved environmental sanitation and 
hygiene and the role of these contaminated public environments in enteric 
infections in children.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N) is an inherited nerve disorder 
caused by mutations in the alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) gene, resulting in 
muscle weakness and sensory issues. Currently, there is no cure for CMT2N. Here, 
we found that all five AlaRS mutations in the aminoacylation domain can interact 
with neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), which is consistent with our previous findings. 
Interestingly, three of these mutations did not affect alanine activation 
activity. We then performed a high-throughput screen of 2000 small molecules 
targeting the prevalent R329H mutant. Using thermal stability assays (TSA), 
biolayer interferometry (BLI), ATP consumption, and proteolysis assays, we 
identified Tanshinone I as a compound that binds to and modifies the 
conformation of the R329H mutant and other CMT-related AlaRS mutants interacting 
with Nrp1. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies further clarified 
Tanshinone I's binding mode, indicating its potential against various AlaRS 
mutants. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pull-down assays showed 
that Tanshinone I significantly reduces the binding of AlaRS mutants to Nrp1. 
Collectively, these findings suggest that Tanshinone I, by altering the 
conformation of mutant proteins, disrupts the pathological interaction between 
AlaRS CMT mutants and Nrp1, potentially restoring normal Nrp1 function. This 
makes Tanshinone I a promising therapeutic candidate for CMT2N.

Tomatoes are rich in lycopene, β-carotene, ascorbic acid and other mineral 
sources including phosphorus, potassium, zinc, magnesium and iron. Major 
constraints in tomato cultivation were high cost, poor cultivation due to 
adverse weather conditions, pest attacks, microbial infections and nutritional 
deficiency complications. Conventional fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and 
growth regulators are effective at higher concentration, which induces specific 
toxic effects on soil fertility, plant yield and also affects the health status 
of humans, animals and soil associated microbes. The use of organic fertilizers 
to meet the soil nutrient demand increases the acidity of soil affecting plant 
growth, which turned the focus of researchers towards nanofertilizer. The 
present study focuses on synthesis of marine waste derived CaCO3 nanoparticles 
formulated with azadirachtin and panchakavya emulsion to develop a CaCO3 
nanofertilizer. CaCO3 nanofertilizer developed through this study was 
investigated for its material properties and behavioral traits. Further, the 
in-vitro antifungal impact of the CaCO3 nanofertilizer was examined, and it was 
sprayed on tomato plants via foliar spray. CaCO3 nanofertilizer effectively 
inhibited fusarium wilt causing plant fungal pathogen and also exhibited 
enhanced growth and yield of tomatoes against pest attack and nutritional 
deficiency with effect to foliar treatment. Also, CaCO3 nanofertilizer enhanced 
the total carotenoid level and essential nutritional minerals in fruit yield of 
tomatoes. Overall, fabricated CaCO3 nanofertilizer exhibits synergistic role of 
fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide and growth regulator in tomato cultivation. It 
suggests that, CaCO3 nanofertilizer generated from renewable biowaste will 
become the innovative platform for sustainable agriculture.

BACKGROUND: Candida species, especially Candida albicans, cause oral 
candidiasis, also known as oral thrush. It affects the elderly, newborns, 
patients under antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and patients with weaker 
immune systems. Although successful, traditional antifungal medications are 
available, they may have negative effects and do not prevent recurrence. 
Conventional antifungal medications have a restricted range of effectiveness; 
hence, the need for a novel antifungal agent arises. Chitosan, a natural polymer 
made from chitin found in crustaceans, kills fungal cells by damaging membranes. 
Excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability make it a promising medical 
material. Probiotics, live bacteria, compete with pathogenic microbes for 
adhesion sites and nutrients, produce antimicrobials such as lactic acid, 
hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins, and modulate the host's immunological 
response. Adding probiotics to chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) boosts their 
antifungal activity against Candida species and increases their stability and 
transport to the infection site.
METHODS: The antifungal activity was evaluated through in vitro experiments 
utilizing Candida strains that are significant to oral candidiasis. Different 
concentrations of CSNPs and formulations loaded with probiotics were examined to 
assess their effectiveness. The antifungal properties were assessed using 
microbiological assays, specifically agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC).
RESULTS: The study demonstrated a notable fungicidal impact of CSNPs combined 
with probiotics against oral candidiasis. Furthermore, the MIC values were lower 
for the probiotic-loaded CSNPs than for chitosan alone or probiotics alone.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CSNPs and probiotics shows potential in 
effectively combating oral candidiasis by inhibiting fungal growth. This novel 
method offers a promising strategy for creating therapeutic treatments for oral 
candidiasis by utilizing the combined benefits of chitosan and probiotics to 
combat fungal infections effectively.

Melioidosis is a life-threatening tropical disease caused by an intracellular 
gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. B. pseudomallei polymerizes 
the host cell actin through autotransporters, BimA, and BimC, to facilitate 
intracellular motility. Two variations of BimA in B. pseudomallei have been 
reported previously: BimABp and BimA B. mallei-like (BimABm). However, little is 
known about genetic sequence variations within BimA and BimC, and their 
potential effect on the virulence of B. pseudomallei. This study analyzed 1,294 
genomes from clinical isolates of patients admitted to nine hospitals in 
northeast Thailand between 2015 and 2018 and performed 3D structural analysis 
and plaque-forming efficiency assay. The genomic analysis identified 10 BimABp 
and 5 major BimC types, in the dominant and non-dominant lineages of the B. 
pseudomallei population structure. Our protein prediction analysis of all BimABp 
and major BimC variants revealed that their 3D structures were conserved 
compared to those of B. pseudomallei K96243. Sixteen representative strains of 
the most distant BimABp types were tested for plaque formation and the 
development of polar actin tails in A549 epithelial cells. We found that all 
isolates retained these functions. These findings enhance our understanding of 
the prevalence of BimABp and BimC variants and their implications for B. 
pseudomallei virulence.

Ongoing competition between disease-causing bacteria and human hosts has 
resulted in the discovery of a wide array of antibacterials. The advent of 
antibacterials ushered in a promising period in the realm of microbiology, but 
its brilliance was short-lived and soon diminished. The excessive and incorrect 
use of antibacterials results in limited selection pressure on the targeted 
microorganisms, which in turn promotes the evolution of microbes instead of 
killing them. Consequently, antibacterial resistance has developed and given 
rise to strains that are resistant to many drugs, leading to a significant 
increase in mortality rates. The current review delves into the potential of 
novel natural phytocompounds as innovative solutions to combat these potential 
bacterial threats. The review begins by showcasing the modus operandi of 
conventional antibacterial drugs followed by addressing the mechanisms of 
resistance to antibacterial agents, which have significantly lowered the 
efficacy of conventional treatments. In contrast, the review explores the 
mechanism of antibacterial activity of plant-derived phytochemicals, unraveling 
the various ways in which natural compounds interact with bacterial targets. 
Furthermore, the review examines the synergism between plant phytochemicals and 
conventional antibiotics, showcasing the efficacy of this combinatorial approach 
in overcoming resistance. The review concludes by summarizing the current 
research and offering valuable insights into challenges in the use of plant 
phytochemicals as antibacterial therapeutics. This comprehensive overview 
reinforces the promise of incorporating modern scientific tools with traditional 
phytotherapy to develop effective strategies against resistant bacterial 
pathogens.

Host mitochondria undergo fission and fusion, which bacteria often exploit for 
their infections. In this study, the underlying molecular mechanisms are aimed 
to clarify through which Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), a human 
bacterial pathogen, manipulates mitochondrial dynamics to enhance its 
pathogenicity. It is demonstrated that L. monocytogenes triggers transient 
mitochondrial fission through its virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO), driven 
by LLO's interaction with Mic60, a core component of the mitochondrial contact 
site and the cristae organizing system (MICOS). Specifically, Phe251 within LLO 
is identify as a crucial residue for binding to Mic60, crucial for LLO-induced 
mitochondrial fragmentation and bacterial pathogenicity. Importantly, it is that 
Mic60 affect the formation of F-actin tails recruited by L. monocytogenes, 
thereby contributing to intracellular bacterial infection. Mic60 plays a 
critical role in mediating changes in mitochondrial morphology, membrane 
potential, and reactive oxidative species (ROS) production, and L. monocytogenes 
infection exacerbates these changes by affecting Mic60 expression. These 
findings unveil a novel mechanism through which intracellular bacteria exploit 
host mitochondria, shedding light on the complex interplay between hosts and 
microbes during infections. This knowledge holds promise for developing 
innovative strategies to combat bacterial infections.

Microplastics (MPs) colonized by pathogens pose significant risks to the 
environment and health of animals and humans, however, the strategies for 
pathogens colonization in MPs and the effects of its colonization on spread of 
pathogens have not been fully characterized. Here, we investigated the biofilm 
formation mechanism regulated by c-di-GMP in Hafnia paralvei Z11, and determined 
the effect of MPs colonized by H. paralvei Z11 on the spread of strain Z11. 
Overexpression of yhjH, a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase gene, attenuated 
intracellular c-di-GMP level in strain Z11, leading to an increase in biofilm 
dispersal and a decrease in biofilm formation. Meanwhile, the decline of 
c-di-GMP inhibited the expression of cAMP phosphodiesterase genes, increasing 
the cAMP content and promoting bacterial motility, that was responsible for the 
increase of biofilm dispersal. Furthermore, the formation of biofilms by strain 
Z11 on MPs promotes its colonization, which contributes to its vertical and 
horizontal spread in water after colonizing polyvinyl chloride-MPs and 
polypropylene-MPs, respectively. Therefore, this study reveals, for the first 
time, MPs colonized by H. paralvei Z11 through biofilms regulated by crosstalk 
between c-di GMP and cAMP promote the spread of strain Z11 in water, which 
expands the understanding of colonization strategy of pathogens on MPs and its 
risk on spread of pathogens.

The gastrointestinal tract has remarkable capacity to withstand considerable 
insults from exposure to abrasive food particles, chemicals, allergens, and 
pathogenic microbes. Maintaining a robust epithelial barrier sequesters these 
potentially harmful substances in the lumen, preventing absorption into the 
systemic circulation. Normal functioning of this barrier is central in diverse 
physiological processes including digestion, immunity, inflammation, and 
gut-brain signaling. One crucial component of the barrier is the mucus layer 
covering the epithelium. There is increased appreciation of the importance of 
mucus in maintenance of the gut barrier, and how dysregulation of the mucus 
layer contributes to several common gastrointestinal pathologies. This 
manuscript reviews the physical and chemical properties of mucus, its 
maintenance and turnover, and its role in maintaining gut barrier integrity. The 
dynamic interactions of the mucus layer within the gut ecosystem are illustrated 
by highlighting how a weakened mucus layer or defective mucus production 
facilitate pathogenic microbial colonization and mucosal biofilm formation. 
These may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal 
diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases or result in secretion and mucosal 
damage and inflammation in bile acid diarrhea. A final goal is to review how 
certain dietary factors, especially low-fiber diets and emulsifiers common in 
Western diets, can harm the mucus layer. This report summarizes evidence from 
preclinical and human studies that document damage to the mucus layer, and 
reviews approaches, including diets and probiotics, that promote a healthy mucus 
layer and break down pathogenic biofilms, thereby potentially preventing and/or 
treating gastrointestinal diseases that impact mucosal integrity.

The 21st century has witnessed several clinical outcomes regarding AMR. One 
health concept has been foreseen as a standard global public health initiative 
in ensuring human, animal and environmental health. The present study explores 
critical Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens encompassing Acinetobacter baumannii 
(ACB), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPX) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAE). A 
comparative genomic analysis approach was utilized for identifying novel and 
putative genes coercing global health consequences stressing the significance of 
the above iatrogenic and nosocomial pathogens. O findings reveal that 
Pseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 (PAE) possesses the largest genome, measuring 
62,64,404 base pairs, containing 14,342 protein-coding genes and an elevated 
count of ORFs, surpassing other organisms. Notably, P. aeruginosa PAO1 exhibits 
a comprehensive metabolic landscape with 355 pathways and 1659 metabolic 
reactions, encompassing 200 biosynthesis and 132 degradation pathways. 
Transferases are the predominant enzyme category across all three genomes, 
followed by oxidoreductases and hydrolases. The pivotal role of beta-lactamase 
in conferring resistance against antibiotics is also evident in all three 
microbes. This investigation underscores the PAE genome harbours genes and 
enzymes associated with heightened virulence in antibiotic resistance. The 
holistic review combined with comparative genomics underlines the significance 
of delving into the genomes of these antimicrobial-resistant organisms. In 
silico methodologies are increasingly stressed in aiding the successful 
accomplishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal -3: Good 
Health and Well-being. The prominent findings establish Carbapenem resistance 
and evolutionary lineages of the MCR-1 gene conferring AMR landscapes for future 
research.

BACKGROUND: maternal health during pregnancy can affect the intestinal microbial 
community of offspring, but currently the impact of intrauterine environmental 
changes resulting from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on the microbiota of 
offspring as well as its interaction with the immune system remains unclear.
AIMS: to explore the impact of intrauterine microbial exposure during pregnancy 
of gestational diabetes mellitus on the development of neonate's intestinal 
microbiota and activation of immune responses.
METHODS: Levels of lipopolysaccharides in cord blood from GDM and expression of 
microbial recognition-related proteins in the placenta were measured. To 
evaluate embryonic intestinal colonization, pregnant mice with GDM were 
administered with labeled Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus. The intestinal 
colonization of pups was analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and labeled 
microbial culture. Additionally, memory T lymphocyte and dendritic cell 
co-culture experiments were conducted to elucidate the immune memory of 
intestinal microbes during the embryonic stages.
RESULT: Gestational diabetes mellitus led to elevated umbilical cord blood LPS 
level and increased GFP labeled Escherichia coli in the offspring's intestine 
after gestational microbial exposure. The mouse model of GDM exhibited increased 
immune markers including TLR4, TLR5, IL-22 and IL-23 in the placenta and a 
recall response from memory T cells in offspring's intestines, with similar 
observations found in human experiments. Furthermore, reduced intestinal 
microbiome diversity and an increased ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was 
found in GDM progeny, with the stability of bacterial colonization been 
interfered.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation has revealed a noteworthy correlation between 
gestational diabetes and intrauterine microbial exposure, as well as alterations 
in the neonatal microbiota and activation of immune responses. These findings 
highlight the gestational diabetes's role on offspring's gut microbiota and 
immune system interactions with early-life pathogen exposure.

An increase in the number of drug-resistant microbes is a major threat to human 
health. Bacterial drug resistance is mostly mediated by biofilm formation. In 
this study, the culture filtrate from the edible mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, 
was fractionated to isolate compounds that inhibit the biofilm formation of six 
pathogenic bacteria. Notably, we isolated compounds 16 using bioassay-guided 
chromatographic separations. Spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses 
identified 1 as a novel fused bicyclic pyrone-furan, named pleuropyronine, 
whereas 2-6 were known polyketides. Pleuropyronine inhibited biofilm formation 
in four gram-negative bacteria, with IC50 values ranging from 5.4 to 8.7 µg/mL, 
whereas 2-6 exhibited IC50 values between 1.0 and 5.3 µg/mL against five 
bacteria. Additionally, pleuropyronine bioactivity was confirmed by the 
inhibition of exopolysaccharide and biofilm formation induced by C6-homoserine 
lactone. Thus, this may serve as a pioneering study on the pharmacological 
potential of isolated compounds, offering valuable insights for future research.

Virulence screens have indicated potential roles during Streptococcus pneumoniae 
infection for the one-carbon metabolism pathway component Fhs and proline 
synthesis mediated by ProABC. To define how these metabolic pathways affect S. 
pneumoniae virulence, we have investigated the phenotypes, transcription, and 
metabolic profiles of Δfhs and ΔproABC mutants. S. pneumoniae capsular serotype 
6B BHN418 Δfhs and ΔproABC mutant strains had strongly reduced virulence in 
mouse sepsis and pneumonia models but could colonize the nasopharynx. Both 
mutant strains grew normally in complete media but had markedly impaired growth 
in chemically defined medium, human serum, and human cerebrospinal fluid. The 
BHN418 ΔproABC strain also had impaired growth under conditions of osmotic and 
oxidative stress. The virulence role of proABC was strain specific, as the D39 
ΔproABC strain could still cause septicemia and grow in serum. Compared to 
culture in broth, in serum, the BHN418 Δfhs and ΔproABC strains showed 
considerable derangement in global gene transcription that affected multiple but 
different metabolic pathways for each mutant strain. Metabolic data suggested 
that Δfhs had an impaired stringent response, and when cultured in sera, BHN418 
Δfhs and ΔproABC were under increased oxidative stress and had altered lipid 
profiles. Loss of proABC also affected carbohydrate metabolism and the 
accumulation of peptidoglycan synthesis precursors in the BHN418 but not the D39 
background, linking this phenotype to the conditional virulence phenotype. These 
data identify the S. pneumoniae metabolic functions affected by S. pneumoniae 
one-carbon metabolism and proline biosynthesis, and the role of these genetic 
loci for establishing systemic infection.IMPORTANCERapid adaptation to grow 
within the physiological conditions found in the host environment is an 
essential but poorly understood virulence requirement for systemic pathogens 
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. We have now demonstrated an essential role for 
the one-carbon metabolism pathway and a conditional role depending on strain 
background for proline biosynthesis for S. pneumoniae growth in serum or 
cerebrospinal fluid, and therefore for systemic virulence. RNAseq and 
metabolomic data demonstrated that the loss of one-carbon metabolism or proline 
biosynthesis has profound but differing effects on S. pneumoniae metabolism in 
human serum, identifying the metabolic processes dependent on each pathway 
during systemic infection. These data provide a more detailed understanding of 
the adaptations required by systemic bacterial pathogens in order to cause 
infection and demonstrate that the requirement for some of these adaptations 
varies between strains from the same species and could therefore underpin strain 
variations in virulence potential.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes severe infections in neonates and adults with 
comorbidities. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and 
pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on the presence and 
diversity of prophages in GBS isolates from humans in South America. This study 
provides insights into the prophage content of 365 GBS isolates collected from 
clinical samples in the context of an Argentinean multicentric study. Using 
whole-genome sequence data, we implemented two previously proposed methods for 
prophage typing: a PCR approach (carried out in silico) coupled with a 
blastx-based method to classify prophages based on their prophage group and 
integrase type, respectively. We manually searched the genomes and identified 
325 prophages. However, only 80% of prophages could be accurately categorized 
with the previous approaches. Integration of phylogenetic analysis, prophage 
group and integrase type allowed for all to be classified into 19 prophage 
types, which correlated with GBS clonal complex grouping. The revised prophage 
typing approach was additionally improved by using a blastn search after 
enriching the database with ten new genes for prophage group classification 
combined with the existing integrase typing method. This modified and integrated 
typing system was applied to the analysis of 615 GBS genomes (365 GBS from 
Argentina and 250 from public databases), which revealed 29 prophage types, 
including two novel integrase subtypes. Their characterization and comparative 
analysis revealed major differences in the lysogeny and replication modules. 
Genes related to bacterial fitness, virulence or adaptation to stressful 
environments were detected in all prophage types. Considering prophage 
prevalence, distribution and their association with bacterial virulence, it is 
important to study their role in GBS epidemiology. In this context, we propose 
the use of an improved and integrated prophage typing system suitable for rapid 
phage detection and classification with little computational processing.

During the active surveillance, we isolated nine H4N6 subtype influenza A 
viruses from wild birds in China. To reveal the epidemiology and biology 
characteristics of H4 subtype influenza A virus from wild birds, we investigated 
H4 subtype viruses available in the public source, and found that the H4 viruses 
have been detected in at least 37 countries to date, and more than 73.6% of the 
viruses were from wild Anseriformes. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showed 
that Mongolia worked as the important transmission centre for Eurasian lineage 
H4 viruses spreading. Phylogenetic analysis of HA genes indicated that global H4 
influenza A viruses were divided into Eurasian and North American lineage, our 
nine H4N6 isolates fell into the Eurasian lineage. Recombination analysis 
suggested that nine H4N6 isolates underwent complex gene recombination with 
various subtypes of influenza A viruses and formed two genotypes. Notably, nine 
H4N6 isolates acquired mammalian virulence-increasing residues. Two 
representative H4N6 viruses possessed dual receptor binding specificity, they 
could efficiently replicate in MDCK and 293 T cells in vitro infection, also 
could cross the species barrier to infect mice directly without prior adaption 
in vivo experiments. These findings emphasize the public health issues 
represented by H4 viruses, and highlight the need to strengthen the active 
surveillance of H4 viruses from wild birds.

Foodborne infections caused by microbes are a serious health risk. Regarding 
this, customer preferences for "ready-to-eat" or minimally processed (MP) deer 
meat are one of the main risk factors. Given the health dangers associated with 
food, essential oil (EO) is a practical substitute used to decrease pathogenic 
germs and extend the shelf-life of MP meals. Nonetheless, further data regarding 
EO use in MP meals are required. In order to evaluate new, safer alternatives to 
chemicals for disease control and food preservation, this research was carried 
out in the following areas to assess the antibacterial and antibiofilm 
characteristics of Thymus serpyllum (TSEO) essential oil, which is extracted 
from dried flowering stalks. Furthermore, this study applied an essential oil of 
wild thyme and inoculated the sous vide deer meat with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
for seven days at 4 °C in an effort to prolong its shelf-life. Against P. 
aeruginosa, the essential oil exhibited potent antibacterial action. The 
findings of the minimal biofilm inhibition concentration (MBIC) crystal violet 
test demonstrated the substantial antibiofilm activity of the TSEO. The TSEO 
modified the protein profiles of bacteria on glass and plastic surfaces, 
according to data from MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Moreover, it was discovered that 
P. aeruginosa was positively affected by the antibacterial properties of TSEO. 
The anti-Pseudomonas activity of the TSEO was marginally higher in vacuum-packed 
sous vide red deer meat samples than in control samples. The most frequently 
isolated species from sous vide deer meat, if we do not consider the applied 
bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were P. fragi, P. lundensis, and P. taetrolens. 
These results highlight the antibacterial and antibiofilm qualities of TSEO, 
demonstrating its potential for food preservation and extending the shelf-life

Microorganisms colonize all barrier tissues and are present on the skin and all 
mucous membranes from birth. Bacteria have many ways of influencing the host 
organism, including activation of innate immunity receptors by 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and synthesis of various chemical 
compounds, such as vitamins, short-chain fatty acids, bacteriocins, toxins. 
Bacteria, using extracellular vesicles, can also introduce high-molecular 
compounds, such as proteins and nucleic acids, into the cell, regulating the 
metabolic pathways of the host cells. Epithelial cells and immune cells 
recognize bacterial bioregulators and, depending on the microenvironment and 
context, determine the direction and intensity of the immune response. A large 
number of factors influence the maintenance of symbiotic microflora, the 
diversity of which protects hosts against pathogen colonization. Reduced 
bacterial diversity is associated with pathogen dominance and allergic diseases 
of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and upper and lower respiratory tract, as 
seen in atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food 
allergies, and asthma. Understanding the multifactorial influence of microflora 
on maintaining health and disease determines the effectiveness of therapy and 
disease prevention and changes our food preferences and lifestyle to maintain 
health and active longevity.

BACKGROUND: The world society is still suffering greatly from waterborne 
infections, with developing countries bearing most of the morbidity and death 
burden, especially concerning young children. Moreover, microbial resistance is 
one of the most prevalent global problems that extends the need for 
self-medication and the healing period, or it may be linked to treatment failure 
that results in further hospitalization, higher healthcare expenses, and higher 
mortality rates. Thus, innovative synthesis of new antimicrobial materials is 
required to preserve the environment and enhance human health.
RESULTS: The present study highlighted a simple and cost-effective approach to 
biosynthesize a chitosan/graphene oxide/zinc oxide nanocomposite (CS/GO/ZnO) 
alone and immobilized in a macroporous cryogel as a new antimicrobial agent. 
Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was used as a safe and efficient bio-nano-factory 
during biosynthesis. The formation of CS/GO/ZnO was confirmed and characterized 
using different analyses including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 
selective area diffraction pattern (SADP), Zeta analyses, scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GO combined with 
ZnO NPs successfully and displayed an adsorption peak at 358 nm. The XRD results 
showed the crystalline composition of the loaded ZnO NPs on GO sheets. FTIR 
spectrum confirmed the presence of proteins during the synthesis which act as 
stabilizing and capping agents. The nanocomposite has a high negative surface 
charge (-32.8 ± 5.7 mV) which increases its stability. SEM and TEM showing the 
size of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs was in the range of 40-50 nm. The CS/GO/ZnO alone 
or immobilized in cryogel revealed good antimicrobial activities against B. 
cereus ATCC 14,579, Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, and Candida albicans ATCC 
10,231 in a dose-dependent manner. The CS/GO/ZnO cryogel revealed higher 
antimicrobial activity than GO/ZnO nanocomposite and standard antibiotics 
(amoxicillin and miconazole) with inhibition zones averages of 24.33 ± 0.12, 
15.67 ± 0.03, and 17.5 ± 0.49 mm, respectively. The MIC values of the prepared 
nanocomposite against B. cereus, E. coli, and C. albicans were 80, 80, and 
90 µg/ml compared to standard drugs (90, 120 and 150 µg/ml, respectively). 
According to the TEM ultrastructure studies of nanocomposite-treated microbes, 
treated cells had severe deformities and morphological alterations compared to 
the untreated cells including cell wall distortion, the separation between the 
cell wall and plasma membrane, vacuoles formation moreover complete cell lyses 
were also noted. In the cytotoxicity test of CS/GO/ZnO alone and its cryogel, 
there was a significant reduction (p˂0.05) in cell viability of WI-38 normal 
lung cell line after the concentration of 209 and 164 µg/ml, respectively. It 
showed the low toxic effect of the nanocomposite and its cryogel on the WI-38 
line which implies its safety. In addition, water treatment with the CS/GO/ZnO 
cryogel decreased turbidity (0.58 NTU), total coliform (2 CFU/100 ml), fecal 
coliform (1 CFU/100 ml), fecal Streptococcus (2 CFU/100 ml), and heterotrophic 
plate counts (53 CFU/1 ml) not only in comparison with the chlorine-treated 
samples (1.69 NTU, 4 CFU/100 ml, 6 CFU/100 ml, 57 CFU/100 ml, and 140 CFU/1 ml, 
respectively) but also with the raw water samples (6.9 NTU, 10800 CFU/100 ml, 
660 CFU/100 ml, 800 CFU/100 ml, and 4400 CFU/1 ml, respectively). Moreover, 
cryogel significantly decreased the concentration of different heavy metals, 
especially cobalt compared to chlorine (0.004 ppm, 0.002 ppm, and 0.001 ppm for 
raw water, chlorine-treated, and cryogel-treated groups, respectively) which 
helped in the reduction of their toxic effects.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an effective, promising, safe, and alternative 
nanocomposite to treat different human and animal pathogenic microbes that might 
be used in different environmental, industrial, and medical applications.

The ongoing antimicrobial resistant crisis heralds the need for new therapeutics 
against enteric infection. In mouse models, colon epithelial peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) signaling limits oxygen and nitrate 
luminal bioavailability, thereby preventing bacterial pathogen colonization. 
However, whether this mechanism operates similarly in humans remains uncertain. 
To investigate, we used the cloud-based TriNetX Analytics Platform which 
aggregates health records from 117 million patients across 66 US healthcare 
organizations, to assess the risk of bacterial enteric infection among diabetic 
patients prescribed thiazolidinediones, a class of PPAR-γ agonists. Among 85,117 
thiazolidinedione users, we observed a 22-49% lower risk of bacterial enteric 
infections compared to users of other anti-diabetes medications. This reduction 
in risk was consistent across high-risk individuals, regardless of sex or age. 
Similar results were replicated in high-risk patients when thiazolidinedione 
users were directly compared to those on DPP-4 inhibitors. These findings 
support the potential protective role of PPAR-γ signaling against bacterial 
enteric infection and call for further clinical investigation.

A systematic risk assessment approach is essential for evaluating the relative 
risk of influenza A viruses (IAVs) with pandemic potential. To achieve this, the 
Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (TIPRA) was developed under the 
Global Influenza Programme of WHO. Since its release in 2016 and update in 2020, 
TIPRA has been used to assess the pandemic risk of 11 zoonotic IAVs across ten 
evaluation rounds. Notably, A(H7N9), A(H9N2), and A(H5) clade 2.3.4.4 viruses 
were re-evaluated owing to changes in epidemiological characteristics or virus 
properties. A(H7N9) viruses had the highest relative risk at the time of 
assessment, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and 
reassessment as changes in epidemiological trends within animal and human 
populations can alter risk profiles. The knowledge gaps identified throughout 
the ten risk assessments should help to guide the efficient use of resources for 
future research, including surveillance. The TIPRA tool reflects the One Health 
approach and has proven crucial for closely monitoring virus dynamics in both 
human and non-human populations to enhance preparedness for potential IAV 
pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are significant pathogens of humans and 
other animals. Although endemic in humans and birds, novel IAV strains can 
emerge, jump species, and cause epidemics, like the latest variant of H5N1. 
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown capable of detecting human 
IAVs. We aimed to assess whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of IAVs from 
wastewater is possible and can be used to discriminate between circulating 
strains of human and any non-human IAVs, such as those of avian origin.
METHODS: Using a pan-IAV RT-quantitative PCR assay, six wastewater treatment 
works (WWTWs) across Northern Ireland were screened from Aug 1 to Dec 5, 2022. 
A nanopore WGS approach was used to sequence RT-qPCR-positive samples. 
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences relative to currently circulating human and 
non-human IAVs was performed. For comparative purposes, clinical data (PCR test 
results) were supplied by The Regional Virus Laboratory, Belfast Health and 
Social Care Trust (Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK).
FINDINGS: We detected a dynamic IAV signal in wastewater from Sept 5, 2022, 
onwards across Northern Ireland, which did not show a clear positive 
relationship with the clinical data obtained for the region. Meta (mixed strain) 
whole-genome sequences were generated from wastewater samples displaying 
homology to only human and avian IAV strains. The relative proportion of IAV 
reads of human versus avian origin differed across time and sample site. 
A diversity in subtypes and lineages was detected (eg, H1N1, H3N2, and several 
avian). Avian segment 8 related to those found in recent H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was 
identified.
INTERPRETATION: WBE affords a means to monitor circulating human and avian IAV 
strains and provide crucial genetic information. As such, WBE can provide rapid, 
cost-effective, year-round One Health surveillance to help control IAV epidemic 
and pandemic-related threats. However, optimisation of WBE protocols are 
necessary to ensure observed wastewater signals not only correlate with clinical 
case data, but yield information on the wider environmental pan-influenz-ome.

The Gram-negative anaerobic species Fusobacterium nucleatum was originally 
described as a commensal organism from the human oral microbiome. However, it is 
now widely recognized as a key inflammophilic pathobiont associated with a wide 
variety of oral and extraoral diseases. Historically, F. nucleatum has been 
classified into four subspecies that have been generally considered as 
functionally interchangeable in their pathogenic potential. Recent studies have 
challenged this notion, as clinical data reveal a highly biased distribution of 
F. nucleatum subspecies within disease sites of both inflammatory oral diseases 
and various malignancies. This review details the historical basis for the F. 
nucleatum subspecies designations and summarizes our current understanding of 
the similarities and distinctions between these organisms to provide important 
context for future clinical and laboratory studies of F. nucleatum.

Fungal disease poses a growing threat to public health that our current 
antifungal therapies are not well equipped to meet. As the population of 
immunocompromised hosts expands, and ecological changes favor the emergence of 
fungal pathogens, the development of new antifungal agents, including vaccines, 
becomes a global priority. Here, we summarize recent advancements in the 
understanding of fungal pathogenesis, key features of the host antifungal immune 
response, and how these findings could be leveraged to design novel approaches 
to deadly fungal disease.

The resident microbiota are a key component of a healthy organism. The vast 
majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacterial members, which 
constitute a significant portion of resident microbial biomass. Recent studies 
have demonstrated how the fungal component of the microbiota, or the mycobiome, 
influences mammalian biology despite its low abundance compared to other 
microbes. Fungi are known for their pathogenic potential, yet fungi are also 
prominent colonizers in healthy states, highlighting their duality. We summarize 
the characteristics that define the gut mycobiome across life, the factors that 
can impact its composition, and studies that identify mechanisms of how fungi 
confer health benefits. The goal of this review is to synthesize our knowledge 
regarding the composition and function of a healthy mycobiome with a view to 
inspiring future therapeutic advances.

Candida spp. are members of the human mucosal microbiota that can cause 
opportunistic diseases ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening 
invasive candidiasis. In humans, the most common infection caused by Candida 
spp. is vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which affects >70% of women at least 
once in their lifetime. Of those women, ∼5%-10% develop recurrent VVC (RVVC). In 
this review, we summarize our current understanding of the host and fungal 
factors that contribute to susceptibility to VVC and RVVC. We synthesize key 
findings that support the notion that disease symptoms are driven by 
neutrophil-associated dysfunction and immunopathology and describe how 
antifungal immune mechanisms in the vagina are distinct from other mucosal 
barrier sites. Finally, we highlight key, unanswered research areas within the 
field that can help us better understand the immunopathogenesis of this 
infection and facilitate the development of novel preventive, therapeutic, 
and/or vaccination strategies to combat these common, poorly understood 
diseases.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) employs ultra-low-pass sequencing of 
maternal plasma cell-free DNA to detect fetal trisomy. Its global adoption has 
established NIPT as a large human genetic resource for exploring genetic 
variations and their associations with phenotypes. Here, we present methods for 
analyzing large-scale, low-depth NIPT data, including customized algorithms and 
software for genetic variant detection, genotype imputation, family relatedness, 
population structure inference, and genome-wide association analysis of maternal 
genomes. Our results demonstrate accurate allele frequency estimation and high 
genotype imputation accuracy (R2>0.84) for NIPT sequencing depths from 0.1× to 
0.3×. We also achieve effective classification of duplicates and first-degree 
relatives, along with robust principal-component analysis. Additionally, we 
obtain an R2>0.81 for estimating genetic effect sizes across genotyping and 
sequencing platforms with adequate sample sizes. These methods offer a robust 
theoretical and practical foundation for utilizing NIPT data in medical genetic 
research.

The human gut microbiota is home to a diverse collection of microorganisms that 
has co-evolved with the host immune system in which host-microbiota interactions 
are essential to preserve health and homeostasis. Evidence suggests that the 
perturbation of this symbiotic host-microbiome relationship contributes to the 
onset of major diseases such as chronic inflammatory diseases including 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The host glycocalyx (repertoire of 
glycans/sugar-chains at the surface of gut mucosa) constitutes a major 
biological and physical interface between the intestinal mucosa and 
microorganisms, as well as with the host immune system. Glycans are an essential 
niche for microbiota colonization and thus an important modulator of 
host-microorganism interactions both in homeostasis and in disease. In this 
review, we discuss the role of gut mucosa glycome as an instrumental pathway 
that regulates host-microbiome interactions in homeostasis but also in health to 
inflammation transition. We also discuss the power of mucosa glycosylation 
remodelling as an attractive preventive and therapeutic strategy to preserve gut 
homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance (ABR) poses a major burden to global health 
and economic systems. ABR in community-acquired urinary tract infections 
(CA-UTIs) has become increasingly prevalent. Accurate estimates of ABR's 
clinical and economic burden are needed to support medical resource 
prioritization and cost-effectiveness evaluations of urinary tract infection 
(UTI) interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically synthesize the evidence on the 
economic costs associated with ABR in CA-UTIs, using published studies comparing 
the costs of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant cases.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and Embase, Cochrane Review 
Library, and Scopus databases. Studies published in English from January 1, 
2008, to January 31, 2023, reporting the economic costs of ABR in CA-UTI of any 
microbe were included. Independent screening of titles/abstracts and full texts 
was performed based on prespecified criteria. A quality assessment was performed 
using the Integrated Quality Criteria for Review of Multiple Study Designs 
(ICROMS) tool. Data in UTI diagnosis criteria, patient characteristics, 
perspectives, resource costs, and patient and health economic outcomes, 
including mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and costs, were extracted 
and analyzed. Monetary costs were converted into 2023 US dollars.
RESULTS: This review included 15 studies with a total of 57,251 CA-UTI cases. 
All studies were from high- or upper-middle-income countries. A total of 14 
(93%) studies took a health system perspective, 13 (87%) focused on hospitalized 
patients, and 14 (93%) reported UTI pathogens. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most prevalent organisms. A total 
of 12 (80%) studies reported mortality, of which, 7 reported increased mortality 
in the ABR group. Random effects meta-analyses estimated an odds ratio of 1.50 
(95% CI 1.29-1.74) in the ABR CA-UTI cases. All 13 hospital-based studies 
reported LOS, of which, 11 reported significantly higher LOS in the ABR group. 
The meta-analysis of the reported median LOS estimated a pooled excess LOS 
ranging from 1.50 days (95% CI 0.71-4.00) to 2.00 days (95% CI 0.85-3.15). The 
meta-analysis of the reported mean LOS estimated a pooled excess LOS of 2.45 
days (95% CI 0.51-4.39). A total of 8 (53%) studies reported costs in monetary 
terms-none discounted the costs. All 8 studies reported higher medical costs 
spent treating patients with ABR CA-UTI in hospitals. The highest excess cost 
was observed in UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. No 
meta-analysis was performed for monetary costs due to heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: ABR was attributed to increased mortality, hospital LOS, and 
economic costs among patients with CA-UTI. The findings of this review 
highlighted the scarcity of research in this area, particularly in patient 
morbidity and chronic sequelae and costs incurred in community health care. 
Future research calls for a cost-of-illness analysis of infections, 
standardizing therapy-pathogen combination comparators, medical resources, 
productivity loss, intangible costs to be captured, and data from community 
sectors and low-resource settings and countries.

The gut microbiota is crucial for human health, functioning as a complex 
adaptive system akin to a vital organ. To identify core health-relevant gut 
microbes, we followed the systems biology tenet that stable relationships 
signify core components. By analyzing metagenomic datasets from a high-fiber 
dietary intervention in type 2 diabetes and 26 case-control studies across 15 
diseases, we identified a set of stably correlated genome pairs within 
co-abundance networks perturbed by dietary interventions and diseases. These 
genomes formed a "two competing guilds" (TCGs) model, with one guild specialized 
in fiber fermentation and butyrate production and the other characterized by 
virulence and antibiotic resistance. Our random forest models successfully 
distinguished cases from controls across multiple diseases and predicted 
immunotherapy outcomes through the use of these genomes. Our guild-based 
approach, which is genome specific, database independent, and interaction 
focused, identifies a core microbiome signature that serves as a holistic health 
indicator and a potential common target for health enhancement.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of potentially diarrhoeagenic microbes 
(PDMs) in faecal samples from asymptomatic individuals in a high-income country, 
identify risk factors for carriage and to identify microbial factors that differ 
between PDMs in asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals. Samples from 1000 
asymptomatic participants were collected, together with a questionnaire, between 
2015 and 2020 and examined by PCR for 11 PDMs. Isolates were characterised and 
potential risk factors were registered. Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia 
coli (aEPEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), 
enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Campylobacter spp. were found in 163 (16%), 
20 (2.0%), 17 (1.7%), 12 (1.2%) and 11 (1.1%) asymptomatic individuals, 
respectively. Other PDMs were rare. Only low virulent STEC, with stx1c, stx2b or 
stx2f, was detected. Travels outside Europe was a significant risk factor for 
detecting Campylobacter spp. (odds ratio (OR) 6.99; 95% CI 1.12-43.6) and ETEC 
(OR 11.4; 95% CI 1.26-102). Individuals ≥65 years of age had lower odds of 
carrying STEC (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.02-0.57) or EPEC (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.05-0.16) 
than individuals ≤5 years of age. The common finding of PDMs in asymptomatic 
individuals could have implications for the interpretation of positive findings 
in clinical samples and infection control measures.

High arsenic (As), fluoride (F-), and microbial pathogens coexist in semiarid 
conditions afflicting > 240 million people worldwide including Pakistan. 
Groundwater quality has declined due to geogenic and manmade activities 
providing suitable ground for ubiquity, bioavailability, and toxicity of 
contaminants. We tested the health hazard, distribution, and apportionment of 
As, F-, and microbes in groundwater around coal mines in Quetta, Pakistan. The 
range of As, and F- concentrations in groundwater were 0.2-16.6 µg/L, 
0.4-18.5 mg/L. Both, As and F- correlate with high HCO3-, pH, Na+, SO42-, Fe, 
and Mn, and negatively with Ca2+ water. The coalfield showed many folds higher 
As 15.8-28.5 µg/L, and F- 10.8-34.5 mg/L compared to groundwater-wells. 
Geochemical phases revealed saturation of groundwater with calcite, dolomite, 
fluorite, gypsum, and undersaturation with halite-mirabilite, and arsenopyrite 
minerals. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model assessed five-factor 
solutions: geogenic, industrial, coal mining, sulfide & fluoride-bearing 
mineral-dissolution, and agriculture pollution delivered As, F-, and microbial 
contamination. About 24.6 % and 64.4 % of groundwater samples exceeded the WHO 
guidelines of As 10 µg/L, F- 1.5 mg/L. The carcinogenicity, and 
non-carcinogenicity of As, and F- were higher in children than adults. 
Therefore, health hazards in children are of great concern in achieving 
sustainable management goals.

Pathogenic microorganisms in the subsurface can contaminate soil and water 
supplies, potentially posing great danger to human health. Early contamination 
detection routines rely on sparse direct sampling which is spatiotemporally 
limited. Thus, the path of microorganisms in the subsurface remains ambiguous 
and this can cause delays in detection of biohazardous threats. The geophysical 
spectral induced polarization (SIP) technique, sensitive to microbes' presence 
and activity in porous media, is a promising method to monitor microbial 
transport pathways. Here we evaluated the efficiency of SIP in monitoring the 
chemotactic movement of Sporosarcina pasteurii in saturated porous media. A 
cylindrical sample holder was packed with Ottawa sand and saturated with sterile 
KCl solution. The sample holder was oriented vertically and S. pasteurii was 
introduced at the bottom, forcing the movement of the microbes against gravity, 
towards a carbon source available at the top of the column. Temporal SIP 
measurements were collected at 3 regions of the sample holder: bottom (microbial 
injection point), middle and top (carbon source). Both the real (σ') and 
imaginary (σ″) conductivity parts of the SIP signal increased over time with the 
σ″ showing a peak signal magnitude following the upward movement of the 
microbes. We repeated the experiment excluding the carbon source in experiment 2 
and omitting microbial injection in experiment 3. However, we did not observe 
any significant SIP signal changes in these two experiments. This is the first 
study to indicate the strong SIP signal correlation with microbial chemotaxis.

The increase of antibiotic resistance calls for alternatives to control 
Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium associated with various gastric 
diseases. Bacteriophages (phages) can be highly effective in the treatment of 
pathogenic bacteria. Here, we developed a method to identify prophages in H. 
pylori genomes aiming at their future use in therapy. A polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-based technique tested five primer pairs on 74 clinical H. pylori 
strains. After the PCR screening, 14 strains most likely to carry prophages were 
fully sequenced. After that, a more holistic approach was taken by studying the 
complete genome of the strains. This study allowed us to identify 12 intact 
prophage sequences, which were then characterized concerning their morphology, 
virulence, and antibiotic-resistance genes. To understand the variability of 
prophages, a phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of all H. pylori phages 
reported to date was performed. Overall, we increased the efficiency of 
identifying complete prophages to 54.1 %. Genes with homology to potential 
virulence factors were identified in some new prophages. Phylogenetic analysis 
revealed a close relationship among H. pylori-phages, although there are phages 
with different geographical origins. This study provides a deeper understanding 
of H. pylori-phages, providing valuable insights into their potential use in 
therapy.

Interrogation of host-microbe interactions has long been a source of both basic 
discoveries and benefits to human health. Here, we review the role that 
functional genomics approaches have played in such efforts, with an emphasis on 
recent examples that have harnessed technological advances to provide 
mechanistic insight at increased scale and resolution. Finally, we discuss how 
concurrent innovations in model systems and genetic tools have afforded 
opportunities to interrogate additional types of host-microbe relationships, 
such as those in the mammalian gut. Bringing these innovations together promises 
many exciting discoveries ahead.

to tick bites. The mechanisms of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps release (called 
NETosis) and trained immunity in response to tick-borne microbes have not been 
extensively investigated. In our paper, we explored the intricate interplay of 
NETosis and trained immunity within the realm of infectious diseases triggered 
by tick bites and their possible pathogenetic role in autoimmunity. We conducted 
an extensive literature search to identify studies for this review, considering 
articles and reviews published in English within the last years. Additionally, 
we scrutinized the references of all included papers and relevant review 
articles to ensure comprehensive coverage. We shed light on a plausible 
correlation between these innate immune responses and their potential 
implication in certain pathological conditions, with a specific focus on some 
autoimmune diseases. These findings offer new perspectives for a more profound 
comprehension of the immunopathogenesis of certain autoimmune-like signs where 
clinicians should include Tick-Borne Diseases (TBDs) in their differential 
diagnoses, in those geographical areas of tick infestation.

The spread of antibiotic resistance (ABR) in uncommon human pathogens endangers 
global public health, escalating morbidity, death, and healthcare expenditures. 
Pantoea agglomerans, a member of the Erwiniaceae family that rarely infects 
humans, is emerging as a drug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. Seven P. 
agglomerans isolates were recovered from bacteremia patients at a tertiary care 
hospital in Kolkata, West Bengal, between March 2022 and October 2022. The 
isolates were evaluated for phenotypic resistance, β-lactamase and 
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, plasmid profiling, and 
clonality assessment. All isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and 
third-generation cephalosporins, with four resistant to carbapenems. The 
following β-lactamases and PMQR genes were identified: blaOXA-1 (n = 1), blaTEM 
(n = 1), blaCTX-M-1 (n = 2), blaNDM (n = 5), blaOXA-181 (n = 1), qnrB (n = 2), 
and qnrS (n = 4). Six isolates carried up to seven plasmids ranging in size from 
2 kb to > 212 kb. IncFI, FII, HI, and X3 plasmid types were detected in three 
isolates, while the rest remained untypable. Four different genetic patterns 
were noted. Four isolates were clonally related, with three being clonal. The 
swap of environmental isolates to human pathogens exacerbates the ABR dilemma, 
periling patient care and outcomes. This is the first report in India of a 
carbapenem-resistant P. agglomerans blood isolate carrying blaOXA-181. In-depth 
genomic research of drug-resistant microbes adapted to the environment-human 
interfaces might underpin the source-route-containment of ABR.

Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global concern exacerbated by the scarcity 
of new medications and resistance to current antibiotics. Microbes from 
unexplored habitats are promising sources of natural products to combat this 
challenge. This study aimed to isolate bacteria producing secondary metabolites 
and assess their antimicrobial efficacy against human pathogens. Soil and liquid 
samples were collected from Afar region, Ethiopia. Bacterial isolates were 
obtained using standard serial dilution techniques. Antimicrobial activity was 
evaluated using agar plug and well diffusion methods. matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were conducted for the isolate exhibiting the 
highest antimicrobial activity. Secondary metabolites were extracted and 
analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectra (GC-MS). In this study, 301 
bacteria isolates were identified, of which 68 (22.6%) demonstrated antagonistic 
activity against at least one reference pathogen. Whole-genome sequencing 
revealed that Sl00103 belongs to the genus Bacillus, designated as Bacillus sp. 
Sl00103. The extract of Sl00103 showed zones of inhibition ranging between 17.17 
± 0.43 and 26.2 ± 0.4 mm against bacterial pathogens and 19.5 ± 0.44 to 21.0 ± 
1.01 mm against Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate and n-hexane 
extracts identified major compounds including (R,R)-butane-2,3-diol; 
3-isobutylhexahydropyrrolo[1,2a] pyrazine-1,4-dione; cyclo(L-prolyl-L-valine); 
and tetradecanoic acid, 12-methyl-, methyl ester; hexadecanoic acid, methyl 
ester among other. In conclusion, this study isolated several promising 
bacterial strains from the Afar region in Ethiopia, with strain Sl00103 
(Bacillus sp. Sl00103) demonstrating notable antimicrobial and antioxidant 
activities and warranting further studies.
IMPORTANCE: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an escalating global health threat 
affecting humans, animals, and the environment, underscoring the urgent need for 
alternative pathogen control methods. Natural products, particularly secondary 
metabolites from bacteria, continue to be a vital source of antibiotics. 
However, microbial habitats and metabolites in Africa remain largely unexplored. 
In this study, we isolated and screened bacteria from Ethiopia's Afar region, 
characterized by extreme conditions like high temperatures, volcanic activity, 
high salinity, and hot springs to identify potential bioactive compounds. We 
discovered diverse bacterial isolates with antimicrobial activity against 
various pathogens, including strain Sl00103 (Bacillus sp. Sl00103), which 
demonstrated significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. GC-MS 
analysis identified several antimicrobial compounds, highlighting strain Sl00103 
as a promising source of secondary metabolites with potential pharmaceutical 
applications and warranting further investigation.

Airborne fungi and bacteria have been extensively studied by researchers due to 
their significant effects on human health. We provided an overview of the 
distribution and sources of airborne pathogenic microbes, and a detailed 
description of the detrimental effects that these microorganisms cause to human 
health in both outdoor and indoor environments. By analyzing the large body of 
literature published in this field, we offered valuable insights into how 
airborne microbes influence our well-being. The findings highlight the harmful 
consequences associated with the exposure to airborne fungi and bacteria in a 
variety of natural and human-mediated environments. Certain demographic groups, 
including children and the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and various 
categories of workers are particularly exposed and vulnerable to the detrimental 
effect on health of air microbial pollution. A number of studies performed up to 
date consistently identified Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, 
and Fusarium as the predominant fungal genera in various indoor and outdoor 
environments. Among bacteria, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Micrococcus, 
Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas emerged as the dominant genera in air samples 
collected from numerous environments. All these findings contributed to 
expanding our knowledge on airborne microbe distribution, emphasizing the 
crucial need for further research and increased public awareness. Collectively, 
these efforts may play a vital role in safeguarding human health in the face of 
risks posed by airborne microbial contaminants.

Cross interaction between bacterial and fungal microbiota and their relevance to 
human health and disease: mechanistic pathways and prospective therapy.

Diverse bacterial and fungal microbiota communities inhabit the human body, and 
their presence is essential for maintaining host homeostasis. The oral cavity, 
lung, gut, and vagina are just a few of the bodily cavities where these 
microorganisms communicate with one another, either directly or indirectly. The 
effects of this interaction can be either useful or detrimental to the host. 
When the healthy microbial diversity is disturbed, for instance, as a result of 
prolonged treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, this allows the growth of 
specific microbes at the expense of others and alters their pathogenicity, 
causing a switch of commensal germs into pathogenic germs, which could promote 
tissue invasion and damage, as occurs in immunocompromised patients. 
Consequently, antimicrobials that specifically target pathogens may help in 
minimizing secondary issues that result from the disruption of useful 
bacterial/fungal interactions (BFIs). The interface between Candida albicans and 
Aspergillus fumigatus with bacteria at various body sites is emphasized in the 
majority of the medically important BFIs that have been reported thus far. This 
interface either supports or inhibits growth, or it enhances or blocks the 
generation of virulence factors. The aim of this review is to draw attention to 
the link between the bacterial and fungal microbiota and how they contribute to 
both normal homeostasis and disease development. Additionally, recent research 
that has studied microbiota as novel antimicrobials is summarized.

Fusarium fungi are a pervasive threat to global agricultural productivity. They 
cause a spectrum of plant diseases that result in significant yield losses and 
threaten food safety by producing mycotoxins that are harmful to human and 
animal health. In recent years, the exploitation of the RNA interference (RNAi) 
mechanism has emerged as a promising avenue for the control of Fusarium-induced 
diseases, providing both a mechanistic understanding of Fusarium gene function 
and a potential strategy for environmentally sustainable disease management. 
However, despite significant progress in elucidating the presence and function 
of the RNAi pathway in different Fusarium species, a comprehensive understanding 
of its individual protein components and underlying silencing mechanisms remains 
elusive. Accordingly, while a considerable number of RNAi-based approaches to 
Fusarium control have been developed and many reports of RNAi applications in 
Fusarium control under laboratory conditions have been published, the 
applicability of this knowledge in agronomic settings remains an open question, 
and few convincing data on RNAi-based disease control under field conditions 
have been published. This review aims to consolidate the current knowledge on 
the role of RNAi in Fusarium disease control by evaluating current research and 
highlighting important avenues for future investigation.

BACKGROUND: The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) 
puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 
20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such 
pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound 
relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.
RESULTS: In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of 
five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are 
non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a 
deep-learning based tool-deepFRI-we were able to functionally annotate close to 
100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation 
tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across 
all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS 
microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing 
similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, 
including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via 
mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract 
heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements 
enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain 
genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small 
molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, 
exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports 
explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced 
antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we 
studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel 
proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel 
S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse 
microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the 
microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment 
may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space 
missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose 
health risks. Video Abstract.

Fecal contamination of surface water compromises the usability of surface water 
for drinking water production due to an increase in human health risks. In this 
study, we collected surface water samples for two years from the Kokemäki River 
(Finland). The downstream river stretch is used for feeding production of 
artificial ground water for a major drinking water treatment plant. The 
prevalence of Campylobacter species and Salmonella serotypes together with fecal 
source identifiers targeting general, human, gull, swine, and ruminant were 
evaluated at 16 sampling sites throughout the studied watershed. We detected 
Campylobacter spp. from all 16 sampling sites with Campylobacter jejuni and 
Campylobacter lari as the most detected species. Salmonella spp. was detected in 
10 out of 16 sampling sites, with Salmonella Typhimurium being the most common 
serovar. Regarding spatial variation in the hygienic quality of surface water, 
the upstream area (urban proximity) and downstream area (agricultural proximity) 
had higher microbial loads than the middle section of the study area. Samples 
taken in fall and spring had higher microbial loads than summer and winter 
samples. The lower ratio of rRNA to rRNA-gene (rDNA) of studied microbes in the 
winter than in other seasons may indicate low metabolic activity of bacterial 
targets during winter. The number of gulls, swine, and cattle in the catchment 
area concorded with the number of fecal source identifiers in the surface water. 
Further, the prevalence of gull-specific source identifier agreed with the 
detection of C. coli, C. lari, and S. Typhimurim, whereas the prevalence of 
swine- and ruminant-specific source identifiers agreed with the detection of C. 
jejuni and C. coli. Thus, fecal source identifiers are shown to be important 
tools for monitoring zoonotic pathogens affecting microbial quality of surface 
water. Further, variation in fecal loads indicates such variation in health 
risks related to surface water use.

Here, we regularly followed two SARS-CoV-2 infected cohorts to investigate the 
combined effects of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and B and T cell profiles 
during the convalescent period. Ten infected participants in December 2022 were 
selected to assess the effects of an inhaled adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 
vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) booster on B cells and humoral immunity in the first cohort. 
To evaluate T cell responses, eight primary and 20 reinfection participants were 
included in the second cohort. Blood samples from all 38 participants were 
collected at 1-, 2-, and 6-months post-infection. In the first cohort, eighteen 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing activity from memory B cells 
(MBC) against SARS-CoV-2 mutants were obtained by high throughput single-B-cell 
cloning method, which lasted from 1- month to 6- month post infection. The 
overall number of mAbs from MBC in the boosted immunization group was higher 
than that in the nonboosted immunization group at 2-, and 6-months 
post-infection. In the second cohort, circulating T follicular helper cells 
(cTfh) and AIM + CD4 + T cells increased over time in the reinfection group (P < 
0.05). In both cohorts, serum NAb titers showed significant immune escape, while 
cTfh and AIM + CD4 + T cells in the second cohort essentially showed no immune 
escape to new strains (including XBB, EG.5). AIM + CD4 + T cells against BA.5 
and EG.5 were strongly negatively correlated with the time to viral clearance in 
the reinfected group at 6-months post-infection. We comprehensively assessed the 
ability of the SARS-CoV-2 boosted immunization and reinfection-induced 
generation of T/B cell immune memories in preventing reinfection.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in various human diseases, though 
findings across studies have shown considerable variability. In this study, we 
reanalyzed 6314 publicly available fecal metagenomes from 36 case-control 
studies on different diseases to investigate microbial diversity and 
disease-shared signatures. Using a unified analysis pipeline, we observed 
reduced microbial diversity in many diseases, while some exhibited increased 
diversity. Significant alterations in microbial communities were detected across 
most diseases. A meta-analysis identified 277 disease-associated gut species, 
including numerous opportunistic pathogens enriched in patients and a depletion 
of beneficial microbes. A random forest classifier based on these signatures 
achieved high accuracy in distinguishing diseased individuals from controls 
(AUC = 0.776) and high-risk patients from controls (AUC = 0.825), and it also 
performed well in external cohorts. These results offer insights into the gut 
microbiome's role in common diseases in the Chinese population and will guide 
personalized disease management strategies.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked 
to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the 
microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral 
cavity. These sites play an important role in host-microbe homeostasis, and 
disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead 
to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are 
highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of 
microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, 
rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized 
with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to 
characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured 
concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and 
fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and 
microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had 
unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a 
correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal 
swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria 
including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the 
opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, 
the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal 
swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. 
wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, 
highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and 
providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19.IMPORTANCEOutcomes 
in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated 
with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to 
this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that 
severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial 
translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes 
of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal 
bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively 
correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These 
microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in 
COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in 
improving COVID-19 outcomes.

Bacteria-Ig interactions maintain homeostasis in the gut through the clearance 
of pathogenic bacteria and the development of immune tolerance to inflammatory 
bacteria; whether similar interactions modulate inflammation and bacterial 
colonization in the female genital tract is uncertain. In this study, we used a 
flow cytometry-based assay to quantify microbe-binding IgA and IgG in the 
cervicovaginal secretions of 200 HIV-uninfected women from Nairobi, Kenya that 
were enriched for bacterial vaginosis. Total IgA and IgG were abundant and 
frequently demonstrated ex vivo binding to the key vaginal bacteria species 
Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus 
crispatus, which are largely microbe-specific. Microbe-binding Abs were 
generally not associated with the presence or abundance of their corresponding 
bacteria. Total and microbe-binding IgA and IgG were inversely correlated with 
total bacterial abundance and positively correlated with several proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-6, TNF) and chemotactic chemokines (IP-10, MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, 
MIP-3α, MCP-1, IL-8), independent of total bacterial abundance. Flow 
cytometry-based quantification of microbe-binding Abs provides a platform to 
investigate host-microbiota interactions in the female genital tract of human 
observational and interventional studies. In contrast to the gut, cervicovaginal 
microbe-binding IgA and IgG do not appear to be immunoregulatory but may 
indirectly mitigate bacteria-induced inflammation by reducing total bacterial 
abundance.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a feature of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the 
role of proinflammatory microbial infection in CHD remains understudied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CHD was defined in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis) as myocardial infarction (251 participants), resuscitated 
arrest (2 participants), and CHD death (80 participants). We analyzed sequencing 
reads from 4421 MESA participants in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program using the PathSeq workflow 
of the Genome Analysis Tool Kit and a 65-gigabase microbial reference. Paired 
reads aligning to 840 microbes were detected in >1% of participants. The 
association of the presence of microbe reads with incident CHD (follow-up, 
~18 years) was examined. First, important variables were ascertained using a 
single regularized Cox proportional hazard model, examining change of risk as a 
function of presence of microbe with age, sex, education level, Life's Simple 7, 
and inflammation. For variables of importance, the hazard ratio (HR) was 
estimated in separate (unregularized) Cox proportional hazard models including 
the same covariates (significance threshold Bonferroni corrected P<6×10-5, 
0.05/840). Reads from 2 microbes were significantly associated with CHD: Gemella 
morbillorum (HR, 3.14 [95% CI, 1.92-5.12]; P=4.86×10-6) and Pseudomonas species 
NFACC19-2 (HR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.03-5.41]; P=1.58×10-6).
CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomics of whole-genome sequence reads opens a possible 
frontier for detection of pathogens for chronic diseases. The association of G 
morbillorum and Pseudomonas species reads with CHD raises the possibilities that 
microbes may drive atherosclerotic inflammation and that treatments for specific 
pathogens may provide clinical utility for CHD reduction.

Foodborne pathogens have gained sustained public attention, exerted significant 
pressure on food manufacturers, and posed serious health risks to human. 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) has been employed for quick and accurate identification of 
microorganisms in the prevention of foodborne epidemics in recent years. Herein, 
we first summarize the principle of MALDI and its workflow for foodborne 
pathogens. Subsequently, we review the recent progress and applications of 
MALDI-TOF MS in foodborne pathogen determination. Additionally, we outline the 
expanded utilization of MALDI-based techniques for the identification of closely 
related species. We also assess the current gaps and propose possible solutions 
to address the existing challenges. MALDI-TOF MS is a promising biotool for 
rapid and accurate identification of foodborne microbes at the species and genus 
level in food samples. Database expansion and direct quantification of spoilage 
microbes are two promising areas for future progress in MALDI-TOF MS 
applications.
