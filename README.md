This repository showcases Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for extracting and analyzing biomedical literature from PubMed, with a focus on microbial taxa and diseases. The project includes pipelines for data retrieval, named entity recognition (NER), and knowledge graph construction.

What it does::
PubMed Data Collection: Fetches abstracts using keywords via the PubMed API.
Data Preprocessing: Combines and cleans abstracts for NLP analysis.
Named Entity Recognition: Extracts entities like diseases, microbial taxa, and biomedical terms using SciSpacy.
Knowledge Graph Construction: Builds static and interactive graphs to visualize relationships.



#### I WILL UPLOAD THE FULL REPORT ON THE PROJECT BETWEEN DECEMBER 5 AND 10. 

###**UPLOADED ON 8 DEC.**
